00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:57.080
In this episode, Scott talks
with Jeff Atwood. Hi, this

10
00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:59.090
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes,

11
00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.170
checking in with Jeff Attwood.
Hi Jeff. Hi Scott. I'm

12
00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:07.490
so you're home. Yeah, I've
been on paternity leave effectively

13
00:01:07.490 --> 00:01:09.710
for the last four months.
The babies are just now

14
00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:11.810
getting to be four months
old. And this is two

15
00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:14.720
babies at once. This is
two human beings is in

16
00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:16.760
parallel and everyone knows how
hard it is to program

17
00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:20.840
threads. Right? Well, that's also
true of babies. Well, and

18
00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.570
you've got, so you've got
rock hard. Yeah. Awesome. You're

19
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:27.080
three-year-old yeah. And he's doing
great. Gosh, Henry is, he's

20
00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.020
such a great big brother
and now you've got two

21
00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:33.320
more. So you're doing effectively
a zone defense rather than

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:35.990
a man to man defense.
The timing is good though,

23
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:40.220
because Henry is, is a
little over three and he's

24
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:41.780
getting to where he can
go to the bathroom by

25
00:01:41.780 --> 00:01:44.450
himself and we don't have
to watch him all the

26
00:01:44.450 --> 00:01:47.690
time and make sure he's
not gonna kill himself. So

27
00:01:47.690 --> 00:01:49.220
he's just sort of getting
to be where he can

28
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:53.780
be almost helpful a lot
of the times. And that's

29
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.280
great. Like, I don't know
how you would do this.

30
00:01:55.280 --> 00:01:57.200
If you had say, say
you got a kid, a

31
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:58.790
newborn, a one year old
and a two year old

32
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.400
to me, that would be
like, wow, I don't know

33
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.780
how you would do that
because yeah. At some point

34
00:02:05.780 --> 00:02:07.490
it's, it's interesting with kids.
Like they, you start realizing

35
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:09.500
they're working on your team.
They're part of your posse,

36
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.450
you know, they're one of
your homeys, right? They're there

37
00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:13.700
to help you. It's hard
to see it that way

38
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:17.510
initially, because it's a lot
of work, but it does

39
00:02:17.510 --> 00:02:18.860
start to seem like that.
And that's really cool. Like

40
00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:20.570
he and I are playing
through all the Lego games

41
00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:23.750
now. Well, let me restate.
He watches and I play,

42
00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.990
this is the Lego star
Wars and star Wars. And

43
00:02:26.990 --> 00:02:29.960
he cut, he loves Lego,
Indiana Jones so much. And

44
00:02:29.960 --> 00:02:31.340
we've got like a pirates.
We have all the Lego

45
00:02:31.340 --> 00:02:34.340
titles, Lego Batman. We're very
excited. Cause Lego Batman too

46
00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:36.260
is about to come out
like a week or so.

47
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:38.330
And it looks really cool
cause that's Superman and Greenland

48
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:42.350
turn and stuff. And so
that's fun and it's fun

49
00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.750
to sort of involve them
and he doesn't play necessarily,

50
00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:46.670
but he helps me point
some things I can do

51
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:49.580
and that sort of stuff.
So I'm starting to be

52
00:02:49.580 --> 00:02:51.260
a lot more fun with
screen time. Do you like,

53
00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:53.960
how do you, how have
you decided that how much

54
00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:58.460
time he gets in front
of television? I don't know.

55
00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:01.630
Parenting plans, big parenting Decision
is like, how much do

56
00:03:01.630 --> 00:03:04.140
you put your kid in
front of a screen, All

57
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:06.840
American pediatric pediatrics, blah, blah,
blah. You're not supposed to

58
00:03:06.840 --> 00:03:09.900
do too much before the
age of two, but after

59
00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:11.040
the age of two, it's
kind of up to the

60
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.380
parent's discretion For the doctor.
So Personally, I mean, I

61
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:17.790
don't want to say we
do a lot, but like

62
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:19.590
it's one of the few
ways he's a very high

63
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.050
energy child. It's very difficult
to get him to focus

64
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:24.870
on anything. And sometimes it's
nice to be able to

65
00:03:24.870 --> 00:03:27.720
turn on, you know, some
cool cartoon. Like we have

66
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.420
the Batman cartoons, the animated
Batman, which is quite good.

67
00:03:30.510 --> 00:03:33.120
Right. And you know, we'll
turn that on and he'll

68
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.220
watch for a while. And,
but he doesn't really get

69
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.320
addicted. Like he, he likes
to see a lot of

70
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:39.450
different things. He doesn't ask
for the same things too

71
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.540
much over and over. So
I I'm pretty flexible cause

72
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.910
you know, I, I love
these cartoons and part of

73
00:03:44.910 --> 00:03:46.470
this is my heritage too.
It's like, you know, I

74
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:50.040
get to have these experiences
with him alongside him. So

75
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.420
I try to pick out
stuff I haven't seen. And

76
00:03:51.420 --> 00:03:53.160
I would like to see,
and he can watch too.

77
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.640
We've rewatched, PeeWee's big adventure,
like 10 times. And I

78
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.640
swear, that's like the best
movie. I know it doesn't

79
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.070
seem that way. It seems
like there's cultural ephemera, but

80
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:05.220
is big adventure was like
Tim Burton's first movie. It's

81
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.620
good on a lot of
different levels. Right? Leslie subtle

82
00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:10.320
jokes and Okay for kids.
Is there anything in there

83
00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:13.530
I should worry about. There's
the one scene with large

84
00:04:13.530 --> 00:04:16.920
Marge, remember the scene with
the trucker lady, right. He

85
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:20.190
picks, she picks him up
and he becomes very scary

86
00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:21.810
at one point in that
that's the only part that

87
00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.430
I get nervous about showing
to Henry. But the rest

88
00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:27.600
of it is really very
mild. That makes me feel

89
00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.240
better about it. Cause we
just watched star Wars. Oh

90
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:33.060
yeah. We just went through
the first three star Wars

91
00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:36.240
or the four or five
and six rather. And I

92
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:38.370
wrote a whole blog post
about when to introduce your

93
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:40.830
children to star Wars. And
it was great. It was

94
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:43.710
a really interesting post because
I thought I was being

95
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.670
fairly logical about it and
the responses were basically totally

96
00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:50.070
awesome. I love this. Or
you know, what is wrong

97
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.340
with you showing your child
star Wars? And we had

98
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.740
a good time with it
though. We're doing it in

99
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:00.150
machete. Ordering. Have you heard
of this Machete ordering? No,

100
00:05:00.150 --> 00:05:06.090
I haven't. Kenny ordering is
four five, six two three.

101
00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.540
So you skip episode one
entirely and there's this whole,

102
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:15.660
yeah, this is whole intense
deep analysis of like exactly

103
00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:19.350
why episode one provides zero
value and how, you know,

104
00:05:19.350 --> 00:05:21.360
if they never know who
Darth Maul is and all

105
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:23.280
this kind of stuff, then
this is what they'll think

106
00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.830
about the previous ones. And
it's basically, it's the ordering

107
00:05:26.100 --> 00:05:31.050
that pre that keeps all
of the fun. I'm like,

108
00:05:31.170 --> 00:05:33.240
Oh my goodness. It's, it's
really his father and Oh,

109
00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.490
I know they're there they're
twins. And you know, all

110
00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:40.530
the surprises are maintained without
jar jar. I'm pretty sure

111
00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.710
the whole world is a
little bit better without. Absolutely.

112
00:05:43.710 --> 00:05:46.830
Absolutely. And then you introduced
episode one, like a year

113
00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.920
later as like a bit
of this is the Apocrypha.

114
00:05:49.950 --> 00:05:51.960
Like this is the appendix
it's kind of this useless

115
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.000
little movie, but it was
kind of interesting. And then

116
00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:56.700
we also, I try to
decide, do I want to

117
00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:59.930
show them the special additions
or the original additions or

118
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.810
something in between? And I
found that there's this guy

119
00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:06.830
named Harvey, H a R
M Y, who did I

120
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.950
think called the Harmeet D
specialized edition where he took

121
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:12.260
everything that was good about
the specialized additions and then

122
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.860
all of the crappy bits
and literally re edited the

123
00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:19.970
entire movie and like rewrote
a scoped the lightsabers and

124
00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.680
redid a bunch of stuff.
And he basically made a

125
00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:25.340
seven 20 P high-def version
of star Wars that is

126
00:06:25.340 --> 00:06:27.380
as, as close to the
one you saw as a

127
00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.320
kid in the theaters, as
there is possible. So the

128
00:06:30.320 --> 00:06:32.810
Lucas did well, he did
Lucas did, but he also

129
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:34.780
kept some good parts. Like
there's a, there's a Duback

130
00:06:34.780 --> 00:06:37.280
back or two occasionally when
they're wandering on a tattooing,

131
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:40.460
because that was okay. But
all of the like super

132
00:06:40.460 --> 00:06:45.170
excessive and obvious stuff, like,
you know, Han walking over

133
00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:47.990
Java's entail. It was just,
they just yanked it. Cause

134
00:06:47.990 --> 00:06:52.040
it's like, that's just offensive.
Right? So this was, this

135
00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.300
was for the four year
old and a six year

136
00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:55.940
old. And the only bit
that I didn't show them

137
00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.620
was when obiwan cuts the
student's arm off in the

138
00:07:00.620 --> 00:07:02.180
bar. And I was like,
you know, I think that

139
00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.470
traumatic amputation is probably not,
not cool, but you know,

140
00:07:06.470 --> 00:07:09.170
blaster fights when guys just
fall over, it was totally

141
00:07:09.170 --> 00:07:11.380
fine. Well, I did some
research on this. We have

142
00:07:11.380 --> 00:07:13.750
a well at Stacie sheets,
they have a parenting site

143
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.780
night. One of the questions
I asked was about the

144
00:07:16.780 --> 00:07:19.480
influence of cartoon violence on
children, because I was looking

145
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.800
at some of the cartoons
I'd watched as a kid

146
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:22.780
and seeing how violent they
were. And like Tom and

147
00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:25.510
Jerry for example is extremely
violent almost. I think that's

148
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:28.000
what itchy and scratchy was
based on. And the research

149
00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.460
shows that as long as
it's visibly like a cartoon,

150
00:07:30.580 --> 00:07:33.970
like what seems to be
risky is like real actors,

151
00:07:33.970 --> 00:07:37.960
like human beings, pantomiming violence
that is much riskier than

152
00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.330
cartoons doing it. So that's
why when it comes to

153
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:42.820
cartoon content, that's why I'm
almost everything I show Henry

154
00:07:42.820 --> 00:07:47.020
is pretty much cartoons of
some form. And I'm a

155
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:48.850
little bit more comfortable with
that. Even as long as

156
00:07:48.850 --> 00:07:50.470
I'm there to sort of
supervise and explain what's going

157
00:07:50.470 --> 00:07:52.930
on and that sort of
thing. So you wouldn't show

158
00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:55.720
him actual Indiana Jones. No,
I, you know, I thought

159
00:07:55.720 --> 00:07:58.030
about that a lot of
scenes that are kind of

160
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:01.330
scary with like human, like
human looking human beings, there

161
00:08:01.330 --> 00:08:03.400
seems to be this sort
of like protection of being

162
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.580
a cartoon. Yeah. So, well,
when that guy's face, when

163
00:08:06.580 --> 00:08:09.850
that Nazis face melted as
a kid, that was the

164
00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:12.010
scariest thing that I had
ever seen in my entire

165
00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:14.410
life. Yeah. Well, you know,
it's fun to play that

166
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.450
stuff in Lego, all the
Lego versions of the movies.

167
00:08:16.450 --> 00:08:17.770
Now there's going to be
Lego Lord of the rings.

168
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:19.570
Did you hear about this?
Oh, you're kidding. I like

169
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:21.430
those a lot because they
sort of cut out a

170
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:23.170
lot of the scarier stuff
and make it this sort

171
00:08:23.170 --> 00:08:25.060
of fun. Like, Oh, it's
just Lego blocks, but you

172
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:28.450
know, they're doing, they're blowing.
There's guns are shooting. Yeah.

173
00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:31.600
So it's sort of real
world ish, but it's enough

174
00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.360
of a mirror. Have you
had The guns conversation with

175
00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.330
your wife? What's that like
guns? Like where does that

176
00:08:37.330 --> 00:08:40.150
fit in? Oh wow. Let
me just summarize that women

177
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:43.210
don't like guns. Whereas dudes,
most dudes kinda like the

178
00:08:43.210 --> 00:08:47.020
guns and I posted on
Twitter if you saw this.

179
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:49.600
But I had posted on
Twitter that the other day

180
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:53.200
Henry was using a flower
to Pew, something. He literally

181
00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:54.730
picked up a flower off
the ground was going Pew,

182
00:08:54.730 --> 00:08:58.110
Pew. Pew was like, make
war not love. Right. I

183
00:08:58.110 --> 00:08:59.730
picked up a flower and
was shooting people with it.

184
00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.610
And I was like, wow,
how do you really combat

185
00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:04.410
that? It seems like there's
some part of little boys

186
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:07.170
that's just really into the
Pew Pew. Right. I call

187
00:09:07.170 --> 00:09:09.390
it the Pew Pew is
that we don't say gun,

188
00:09:09.990 --> 00:09:12.840
but you know, women just
really don't like it and

189
00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:14.820
aren't into it. And I'm
not saying I, I do

190
00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:16.860
play a lot of games
that involve guns. So I

191
00:09:17.400 --> 00:09:19.170
don't wanna say I like
guns. Cause that sounds weird.

192
00:09:20.010 --> 00:09:21.540
But there's a part of
it. I understand like the

193
00:09:21.540 --> 00:09:24.210
Pew stuff, I get it.
And you see a lot

194
00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:27.120
of it and I don't
know sort of how to

195
00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:29.880
manage that. I don't all
the responses on Twitter said

196
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.820
you can't control this because
we have sons, we tried

197
00:09:32.820 --> 00:09:34.650
to do it. And that
they would like make guns

198
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.400
out of like toast at
breakfast, like whatever objects they

199
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:40.290
had there. This story was
told, I heard this story

200
00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:43.710
15 different times in 54,
15 different ways, whatever objects

201
00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:46.700
they have access to will
become Pew Pew. Right. Right.

202
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:49.640
But I just, there's gotta
be some, some PhDs thesis

203
00:09:49.640 --> 00:09:51.700
about this. Like your wife's
a PhD. She should feel

204
00:09:51.710 --> 00:09:54.470
like on that, figure this
out. Like what, what is

205
00:09:54.470 --> 00:09:56.150
it? I mean, like we
tried to keep guns away

206
00:09:56.150 --> 00:09:58.280
from them until at least
four or five. And they

207
00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:00.530
figured it out. Like as
soon as they could point

208
00:10:00.530 --> 00:10:03.170
a sick point, a stick
at someone and like declare

209
00:10:03.170 --> 00:10:06.290
destruction upon them, it was
figured out on their own.

210
00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.020
Like I think they literally
would have invented guns if

211
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:11.720
they were all alone in
a room without any adults.

212
00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.710
Yeah. And the other thing
that's funny too, is I

213
00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:17.330
was reading a book by
that guy, a J Jacobs

214
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.770
who I've talked to you
about before, who I think

215
00:10:18.770 --> 00:10:21.190
is great. He did the
year of living biblically and

216
00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:24.590
right. Yeah. Really, really funny
guy. And he said his

217
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:26.690
son started telling stories and
the end of every story

218
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:29.240
was, and then everybody died.
That was just like the

219
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:31.400
normal way for them and
stories. It's like, Oh yeah,

220
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:34.880
everybody dies. Right. Yeah. Our
kids put everyone in jail

221
00:10:34.910 --> 00:10:36.410
or they all die. You
know, like if you don't

222
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.380
like somebody put them in
jail, like they'll fight it

223
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.420
with each other. And one
will just declare he should

224
00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:43.490
totally go to jail for
that. And like really forever.

225
00:10:43.490 --> 00:10:47.090
Yeah. This is one of
the reasons I was kind

226
00:10:47.090 --> 00:10:49.460
of glad that the two
twin girls, the twin babies

227
00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:51.680
we just had were girls
was one because I want

228
00:10:51.680 --> 00:10:54.650
to have the girl experience
and two, because the energy

229
00:10:54.650 --> 00:10:56.810
level, it can be hard
to deal with with the

230
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.210
dudes sometimes. I mean, it's
great. You know, I love

231
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.820
him, but man, two more
of Henry would have been

232
00:11:01.850 --> 00:11:06.290
a very intimidating for me
from a parenting perspective. And

233
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:07.970
I think girls do tend
to be just a wee

234
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:10.340
bit calmer. Maybe not so
much into the Pew Pew.

235
00:11:11.450 --> 00:11:13.100
I granted it gets a
lot weirder when they turn

236
00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.710
13 and the whole sex
thing. See, that's the thing

237
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:18.200
that they say that the
baby's like boys are like

238
00:11:18.410 --> 00:11:20.570
chaos from like zero to
10. And then girls are

239
00:11:20.570 --> 00:11:23.180
chaos from 10 to 20,
But that's so far in

240
00:11:23.180 --> 00:11:24.770
the future right now. I'm
just looking to amortize that

241
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.670
cost. Like I don't care.
I'll take 10 years of

242
00:11:28.670 --> 00:11:31.160
a slightly easier that that's
a reasonable trade off for

243
00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:34.040
me. That's great. So, so
what else are you doing?

244
00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:36.950
I notice you're blogging more.
Yeah. I've been writing a

245
00:11:36.950 --> 00:11:39.020
lot more. I keep seeing
you on hacker news to

246
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.000
the point where the guys
on hacker news are tired

247
00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.680
of seeing you. I don't
try and actually try to

248
00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:47.720
avoid going to hacker and
it's actually try to avoid

249
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.400
reading a lot of feedback
on my stuff now. I

250
00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.170
mean, I want to be
responsive to comments cause I

251
00:11:51.170 --> 00:11:54.790
really do believe in that
of people posting, you know,

252
00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:57.640
interesting commentary on the posts,
like adding stuff like asking,

253
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.980
why did you post about
this? Or clarification's, I've gotten

254
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.110
really good information from comments.
And I continue to believe

255
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:05.290
in the value of comments,
but there's also this, I

256
00:12:05.290 --> 00:12:08.410
think offsite commentary, there's this
whole dynamic of onsite commentary

257
00:12:09.280 --> 00:12:10.660
where they're sort of in
your house and they'd be,

258
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:12.760
they're a little bit more
respectful. And then there's offsite

259
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:15.220
commentary where they have their
own communities and they may

260
00:12:15.220 --> 00:12:16.990
not even like you as
a writer, which is okay,

261
00:12:16.990 --> 00:12:18.070
like, you don't have to
like me, you don't have

262
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:21.010
to respect me, but the
tone can get weird. Right?

263
00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:23.650
So like sometimes I just
don't want to even go

264
00:12:23.650 --> 00:12:26.290
there until like days, days
later, just sort of read

265
00:12:26.290 --> 00:12:29.110
it after the fact versus
getting embroiled in a bunch

266
00:12:29.110 --> 00:12:31.870
of, you know, commenting back
and forth about what's going

267
00:12:31.870 --> 00:12:34.540
on because what they're doing
there really isn't about me.

268
00:12:34.540 --> 00:12:36.670
It's like me being there.
It isn't that helpful. Right?

269
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:39.370
I said my piece on
the blog, it's not my

270
00:12:39.370 --> 00:12:42.130
house. It's not my blog.
So I mean, I'm free

271
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:44.290
to read it like anyone
else, but it's it's, I

272
00:12:44.290 --> 00:12:46.240
don't know. More and more,
I believe these offsite commenting

273
00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.790
communities are, you should be
very, very hands off with

274
00:12:48.790 --> 00:12:50.410
them. You shouldn't be over
there interacting with them too

275
00:12:50.410 --> 00:12:52.920
much. It seems like some
people are willing to turn

276
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.530
comments off on their blog.
And then like I was

277
00:12:55.530 --> 00:13:00.090
talking to reg original Braithwaite
Reagan Wald, and I were

278
00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.520
doing a show with him
on this developer's life in

279
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:04.680
a, in a week or
two. And he basically said,

280
00:13:04.690 --> 00:13:07.080
you know, he, that is
his community. So he puts

281
00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:09.990
stuff on his blog, which
has no comments. And then

282
00:13:09.990 --> 00:13:12.540
if comments fire up somewhere,
then he'll link over to

283
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:14.670
there. And that's where the
conversation happens. But from my

284
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.480
perspective, people on OT who
do offsite comments get really

285
00:13:18.480 --> 00:13:21.120
negative comments. Like people are
willing like you, you cultivate

286
00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:24.120
your community on your blog,
but as far as kindness,

287
00:13:24.660 --> 00:13:27.780
you know, like good luck
getting kindness on an offsite

288
00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.960
comment location, I've had some
mean, mean comments on like

289
00:13:31.230 --> 00:13:35.130
stack overflow and hacker news.
Well, stack overflow is known

290
00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.410
common in community Several float
rather, excuse me, slash dot

291
00:13:37.590 --> 00:13:42.420
pod. Okay. I'll say yeah.
Anyway, the point is though

292
00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:44.940
hacker news is offsite comments
and that's where like people

293
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.760
are willing to like let
their hair down. Right. Well,

294
00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.580
it's interesting dynamic. I love
communities like that, but I

295
00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:53.730
do think it's a very
different thing from having comments

296
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:55.500
on your own site. I
don't think it's, I don't

297
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.180
think it replaces that at
all. In fact, I think

298
00:13:57.180 --> 00:13:58.740
you lose something. I think
you lose some of the,

299
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:02.250
a little bit of civility
in some of the, I

300
00:14:02.250 --> 00:14:04.860
don't know, it's just a
different tone. Now. One thing

301
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:06.780
I wrote recently that got
a lot of traction, that

302
00:14:06.810 --> 00:14:08.640
again, I don't sit down
and write with the attention

303
00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:09.960
of like, I'm gonna make
this big deal out of

304
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:11.670
this and everybody's going to,
it's going to blow up.

305
00:14:11.670 --> 00:14:15.060
Right. It was the don't
learn to code thing. And

306
00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:16.530
you had a nice response
that I really, really liked

307
00:14:16.530 --> 00:14:18.060
your response because that's the
kind of the same thing

308
00:14:18.060 --> 00:14:20.060
I was trying to say,
which was, you know, your,

309
00:14:20.060 --> 00:14:21.420
your analogy was the plumbing.
It's like, well, I don't

310
00:14:21.420 --> 00:14:22.620
need to learn plumbing. But
when then I had a

311
00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:24.780
plumbing problem, like the rain
fell down in the, in

312
00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:25.830
the sink. I was like,
well, how do I figure

313
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:27.570
this out? And you know,
I've done that too. Like

314
00:14:27.570 --> 00:14:30.870
we had a, the sink
got clogged here, like after

315
00:14:30.870 --> 00:14:34.620
Thanksgiving, which always happens with
the potatoes apparently. And I

316
00:14:34.620 --> 00:14:36.450
went in and I bought
a little bit of plumbing

317
00:14:36.450 --> 00:14:38.640
equipment and I basically wrote
a word in a very

318
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.550
getaway, like the actual under
the sink, like where it

319
00:14:41.550 --> 00:14:44.880
actually goes under the house,
clear it out. And I

320
00:14:44.880 --> 00:14:46.290
was like proud of myself.
I was like, Hey, I'm

321
00:14:46.290 --> 00:14:47.580
a plumber. I thought, I'm
pretty sure I posted on

322
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.980
Twitter about this. Cause I
was so proud of myself,

323
00:14:51.080 --> 00:14:53.390
but I, I, I support
that just in time sort

324
00:14:53.390 --> 00:14:55.610
of way of figuring this
stuff out, but where I

325
00:14:55.610 --> 00:14:59.090
really worry and where I
wanted there to be a

326
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:01.700
little bit of counter-programming was
the people that are saying

327
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.940
with a straight face, that
programming is as important to

328
00:15:04.940 --> 00:15:09.110
a child to learn as
reading, writing, and math. That

329
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.910
really bothers me because Hey,
not enough. People are actually

330
00:15:13.910 --> 00:15:16.280
good at reading, writing and
math. First of all, before

331
00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:20.090
we start adding stuff to
the list. Right. And second,

332
00:15:20.090 --> 00:15:22.370
like I just, I don't
believe that like I want,

333
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:24.050
I want people to use
computers. I want them to

334
00:15:24.050 --> 00:15:26.840
love computers, but I don't
want everybody to have to

335
00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.160
feel like they have to
be a programmer. I feel

336
00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.170
like that's like a failure
case for the industry. It's

337
00:15:30.170 --> 00:15:32.600
like, Oh, well you got
a program. You know, it's

338
00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.920
like the whole point of
this is like, the computer

339
00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:36.080
is an awesome tool that
gets out of the way

340
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:38.180
and lets you do your
thing, man. And if you're

341
00:15:38.180 --> 00:15:40.880
saying happens to be like
programming, Hey that's awesome. Go

342
00:15:40.880 --> 00:15:42.830
for it. But for a
lot of people, Hey, I'm

343
00:15:42.830 --> 00:15:45.640
a writer. You know, I
just want to write. Yeah.

344
00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.590
I was really surprised that
all in your face, I

345
00:15:47.590 --> 00:15:49.660
was totally surprised that that
blew up into a thing

346
00:15:49.690 --> 00:15:52.270
at all. Like, and then
you, you, you and Jed

347
00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.000
had a lovely back and
forth on a, on Twitter.

348
00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.830
That was really something. Cause
it's just, he likes to

349
00:15:57.220 --> 00:15:59.130
yell at people. It's just
what he does. But I

350
00:15:59.140 --> 00:16:01.510
didn't think it was, I
mean, I thought that your

351
00:16:01.510 --> 00:16:03.520
title was a little link
bait, but everyone's title is

352
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.680
link bait these days. I
think that the point was

353
00:16:05.710 --> 00:16:08.680
learned to think, but to
say, learn to program. I

354
00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:13.030
mean, frankly in the future,
I would hope that programming

355
00:16:13.030 --> 00:16:15.520
as a verb would not
be a word anymore. You

356
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:18.340
know, computers should be usable
if we have to teach

357
00:16:18.340 --> 00:16:20.080
everyone to program them, we're
not really doing a very

358
00:16:20.080 --> 00:16:23.950
good job. Well that's right.
And you know, also what

359
00:16:23.950 --> 00:16:27.040
will programming be? You know,
I mean, is it JavaScript?

360
00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:29.800
Is it Ruby? Is it
C-sharp? Is it football? Is

361
00:16:29.800 --> 00:16:33.070
it C? Is it w
I'm not even sure we

362
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:35.080
really understand what it's going
to be in 20, 30

363
00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:36.910
years. So we're more recommending,
it's like, Oh, go learn

364
00:16:36.910 --> 00:16:39.040
X it's like, I'm not
convinced X is really the

365
00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.650
right thing. You know, like
this stuff is changing a

366
00:16:41.650 --> 00:16:43.930
lot. Now, granted, if you're
a C programmer, you'd be

367
00:16:43.930 --> 00:16:47.590
saying why by golly, nothing
has changed at all since

368
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:50.230
1970 when I learned how
to program C you know?

369
00:16:50.230 --> 00:16:51.640
And, and that's true in
some cases, but I don't

370
00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.030
think we're really good at
identifying what those areas are.

371
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.550
You know, It's funny how
the age thing though, it

372
00:16:57.550 --> 00:17:00.640
makes a difference. I mean
the older I get, the

373
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.950
more I've got that, like
old that kind of get

374
00:17:02.950 --> 00:17:05.890
off my lawn attitude, that
kind of neck beard kind

375
00:17:05.890 --> 00:17:07.540
of thing, where it's like,
you know, we're doing some

376
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:09.550
pretty cool stuff with Azure
right now, but then I'm

377
00:17:09.550 --> 00:17:13.030
realizing that we've built the
five mainframes that the guy

378
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.700
at IBM in 1950 said
that the world would only

379
00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.700
need five computers and now
we've gone and we built

380
00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:22.930
those five computers, you know?
Yeah. Well, computers are everywhere,

381
00:17:22.990 --> 00:17:26.350
right? I mean, like phones
are incredibly powerful computers. Like

382
00:17:26.350 --> 00:17:28.750
when I was writing, I
wrote about the whole iPad

383
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:31.300
thing where, you know, the,
the post PC era, like

384
00:17:31.810 --> 00:17:33.970
to me, what Mark, the
post PC era was, the

385
00:17:33.970 --> 00:17:36.190
iPad was giving me something
I had wanted on my

386
00:17:36.190 --> 00:17:38.250
desktop for, I swear to
God, 15 years, it was

387
00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:41.050
like, give me a truly
high resolution display, none of

388
00:17:41.050 --> 00:17:44.110
this 10 24 by seven
68 bull crap. I want

389
00:17:44.470 --> 00:17:47.020
super high risk. Right. Like
a book. Right, right, right.

390
00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:49.680
I've been waiting for this
forever. You buy this for

391
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:51.630
any amount of money. There
was one IBM display for

392
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.870
like $4,000 that nobody had,
but it just didn't exist.

393
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:56.940
And now Apple says, Hey,
cool. Superhero has this place.

394
00:17:56.940 --> 00:17:59.580
I was like, Oh my
God, thank you finally. Right.

395
00:17:59.580 --> 00:18:02.100
Like, and it came on
a tablet. It was like,

396
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:05.670
the innovation is happening now,
outside the DC, which should

397
00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:07.590
be a little scary if
you're in the PC world.

398
00:18:08.310 --> 00:18:11.610
But you know, to me
that, that that's really important.

399
00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:14.060
This is bizarre that my
iPad has a higher resolution

400
00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:17.720
than my 30 inch Dell.
Well, exactly. How is that?

401
00:18:17.720 --> 00:18:20.810
Okay. You know, Well, I
granted there's a physics problem.

402
00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:22.460
I mean, if you, if
your 30 inch monitor had

403
00:18:22.460 --> 00:18:24.830
the same DPI, it would
be kind of hard for

404
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:27.830
your video card to probably
drive it. Why my iPad

405
00:18:27.830 --> 00:18:29.540
seems to be able to
pull it off. Yeah. It

406
00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:31.730
probably could, but you need
a pretty, pretty decent video

407
00:18:31.730 --> 00:18:33.950
card and anything 3d would
start to get scary. So

408
00:18:33.950 --> 00:18:36.830
I realized there's a reason
it's happening on phones. Like

409
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.470
really small things first and
scaling up. But I feel

410
00:18:39.470 --> 00:18:41.390
like the PC industry wasn't
even trying on this stuff

411
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.570
and you know, the rumor
is that, you know, Mac

412
00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:47.750
next week Apple's going Andrews,
you know, retina display max

413
00:18:47.750 --> 00:18:51.610
and stuff. And I'm like,
well again, why, why have

414
00:18:51.610 --> 00:18:52.970
we had to wait so
long for this stuff to

415
00:18:52.970 --> 00:18:55.640
happen? I realize Heidi PS
is complicated on the desktop

416
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:58.370
because you know, how do
you scale stuff? That's, bitmaps,

417
00:18:58.370 --> 00:19:00.500
there's a lot of bit
mappy UI elements and all

418
00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:02.750
that stuff. It's not like
we have, you know, postscript

419
00:19:02.750 --> 00:19:05.030
on the desktop, like are
the next step boxes or

420
00:19:05.030 --> 00:19:07.220
whatever. Right. So I realize
it's a hard problem, but

421
00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:09.560
it's taken us just absurd
amounts of time to make

422
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:11.720
progress and all the that's
why the progress is happening

423
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:14.630
sort of outside that ecosystem,
because it's easier when you're

424
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:17.180
starting on your own device,
you control the ecosystem. You

425
00:19:17.180 --> 00:19:18.890
know, there's not, I mean,
how much history is the

426
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:21.680
iPad have introduced in what,
2010 it's a two year

427
00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:24.380
old device. So it's easier
for them to go back

428
00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.080
and rewrite history and say,
well, Hey, everything is twice

429
00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:29.170
the resolution it used to
be. Right. Right. Right. Well,

430
00:19:29.180 --> 00:19:32.090
and the way that the
I, the iOS folks have

431
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:33.470
done it in a way
Apple has always done. And

432
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:35.570
I've said this before on
the show, is that kind

433
00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:38.510
of like the dirty little
secret about like why Apple

434
00:19:38.510 --> 00:19:40.280
is so pretty and why
they're able to make things

435
00:19:40.280 --> 00:19:43.010
so perfectly, Anna alias does
it. The entire operating system

436
00:19:43.010 --> 00:19:46.850
is like held together with
like postscript and transparent PNGs.

437
00:19:47.240 --> 00:19:49.850
And as long as you
keep increasing the resolution by

438
00:19:49.850 --> 00:19:53.090
a nice clean factor of
two or a factor four,

439
00:19:53.090 --> 00:19:54.830
depending how you look at
it, then yeah. I just

440
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:59.660
make whatever dot PNG X,
two, and things contain can

441
00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:02.660
continue to be clean. And
if you've got an ecosystem

442
00:20:02.660 --> 00:20:07.550
of Photoshop experts, then you
know, high DPI, PNGs, and

443
00:20:07.550 --> 00:20:09.110
a lot of transparency, and
you're going to have a

444
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.560
gorgeous operating system, but with
windows, you've got this kind

445
00:20:12.560 --> 00:20:17.870
of weird half vectors, half
bitmaps, multi resolution icons thing.

446
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:19.910
I mean, who's got the
time to make 15 different

447
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:23.930
ICO files. The other thing
I've noticed preclude the iPad

448
00:20:23.930 --> 00:20:27.080
is people complain, Oh, everything
should be high now. And

449
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:29.090
that's actually not true if
I'm browsing the web. For

450
00:20:29.090 --> 00:20:30.830
the most part, I don't
really notice that everything is

451
00:20:30.830 --> 00:20:34.370
scaled up, but what does
scale really, really badly? This

452
00:20:34.370 --> 00:20:36.290
is kind of what you're
talking about is small stuff.

453
00:20:36.530 --> 00:20:39.560
Like a 16 by 16
toolbar icon scaled up will

454
00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:43.250
look horrible, right. A little
data to work with. Right.

455
00:20:43.400 --> 00:20:45.590
Right. Whereas if it's like
a three 20 by 200

456
00:20:45.590 --> 00:20:47.560
thing, it's not really gonna
look that if you scale

457
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:49.630
it up by X too,
but small stuff like you

458
00:20:49.630 --> 00:20:53.380
would find on UIs and
stuff looks unusually bad scaled

459
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:57.090
up. So I appreciate that
that's a particular area, But

460
00:20:57.090 --> 00:20:59.190
there's a science of icon
creation and I've talked to

461
00:20:59.190 --> 00:21:03.120
icon designers. And once you
get below 64, by 64,

462
00:21:03.450 --> 00:21:07.920
they recommend that you redraw
them from scratch. So, you

463
00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:09.960
know what I'm saying? Like
you, you can't take a

464
00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.660
gorgeous two 56 by two
56 icon and then make

465
00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.160
an eight by eight and
expect to get anything other

466
00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.370
than a smudge. Well, I
think SVG support, at least

467
00:21:17.430 --> 00:21:19.230
as far as on the
web goes for small stuff,

468
00:21:19.230 --> 00:21:21.300
you could argue that the
small stuff, you could probably

469
00:21:21.300 --> 00:21:24.720
draw some of the small
stuff as SVGs. Although I

470
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.730
also hear what you're saying
about like, just tweaking the

471
00:21:26.730 --> 00:21:28.620
pixels when you only have
16 by 16 to work

472
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.350
with, it's like you almost
hinting isn't even enough yet

473
00:21:31.350 --> 00:21:33.690
chef to do it. Right.
Well anti-aliasing will go and

474
00:21:33.690 --> 00:21:35.550
work against you. And then
it's time to start thinking

475
00:21:35.550 --> 00:21:37.760
about how to make this
as clear as possible. And

476
00:21:37.760 --> 00:21:42.090
if you've got a multi
element icon, you're just gonna

477
00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:44.670
start dropping elements out. You
know what I mean? Well,

478
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:46.080
I think they also had
like so many interests, like

479
00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.790
a font recently that was
like a bunch of like

480
00:21:47.850 --> 00:21:51.240
essentially Wingdings for the web
so that you could use

481
00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:54.750
that instead of relying on,
you know, small, small images

482
00:21:54.750 --> 00:21:56.760
and stuff. But, you know,
I love this high risk

483
00:21:56.760 --> 00:21:58.350
stuff. And you know, I'm
actually going to go on

484
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.770
record here saying that I'm
really strongly considering actually switching

485
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.350
to Mac. Like if they
do the retina display thing,

486
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:07.710
because I don't know, just
to me, I spend so

487
00:22:07.710 --> 00:22:10.050
much time reading text on
the screen and I just

488
00:22:10.050 --> 00:22:11.670
need it to look good.
Like, I mean, to me,

489
00:22:11.670 --> 00:22:16.440
like readability is like, you
know, motherhood and Apple pie.

490
00:22:16.470 --> 00:22:18.480
I mean, this is resolution
is what it's all about.

491
00:22:19.170 --> 00:22:21.240
And if it takes me
getting a Mac to do

492
00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:24.420
that, then I am very,
very tempted to do that

493
00:22:24.630 --> 00:22:26.280
Will be interesting to see
who goes, who gets there

494
00:22:26.280 --> 00:22:29.760
first because I'm reading on
the windows eight log that

495
00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:32.310
they've got the high DPI
stuff baked in. There's just

496
00:22:32.310 --> 00:22:35.190
no hardware to do it,
but they seem to have

497
00:22:35.190 --> 00:22:38.070
thought about that. I just
want to see like, do

498
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.550
they switch to from true
type anti-aliasing to gray scale

499
00:22:41.550 --> 00:22:44.070
to none? I mean, do
you need, antialiasing at 300

500
00:22:44.460 --> 00:22:49.770
DPI? You do. It's a
point of diminishing returns, of

501
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.700
course. But I do think
it does. Yeah, but mine

502
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:54.900
Just take a screenshot on
your iPad and you'll see

503
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:58.020
it's indeed, antialiasing My laser
printer doesn't need to. And

504
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:01.590
dailies, You don't need that
tricky RGB antibiose cause RGB

505
00:23:01.590 --> 00:23:04.050
anti-aliasing the other problem with
that is the rotation factor

506
00:23:04.620 --> 00:23:08.430
tablet. It's assuming a certain
orientation of the RGB layout.

507
00:23:08.430 --> 00:23:10.800
And that changes when you
turn the display. So you

508
00:23:10.800 --> 00:23:13.380
go from say three X
simulated, horizontal, which three X

509
00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.780
simulated vertical with which isn't
really a vertical height, which

510
00:23:15.780 --> 00:23:18.570
isn't that helpful. Yeah. So
there's that problem as well,

511
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:20.700
the whole orientation rotation. And
it was funny to see

512
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.070
that I E and I'm
like with the nine and

513
00:23:23.070 --> 00:23:25.590
10 and also Firefox, but
Chrome has not done this

514
00:23:25.590 --> 00:23:27.930
yet. They actually switched to
a different rendering model for

515
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.960
the font. Yeah. I noticed,
I saw a thing on

516
00:23:31.830 --> 00:23:38.700
long Jangs blog. I started
something.com where chunks of windows

517
00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:43.410
eight, aren't using clear type
they're using grayscale. Yeah. Because

518
00:23:43.410 --> 00:23:46.100
of rotation. And there's a
bunch of reasons that you

519
00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:47.660
would want to do that.
And other would be a

520
00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:51.250
high res high resolution. Have
you, when I talked to

521
00:23:51.250 --> 00:23:53.020
you earlier, you said you
were playing with windows eight.

522
00:23:53.830 --> 00:23:55.120
Yeah. I had been reading
a little bit about it

523
00:23:55.120 --> 00:23:57.010
and I liked what I
saw actually a lot, but

524
00:23:57.010 --> 00:23:58.450
this is the first time
I actually installed it because

525
00:23:58.450 --> 00:24:01.990
we had a laptop, the
headache, a bum SSD that

526
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:04.210
just died. It never really,
it was always kind of

527
00:24:04.210 --> 00:24:06.160
sketchy. It was just, I
don't know, I just a

528
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.980
bad SSD purchase I guess,
but it finally died. So

529
00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:10.120
I put a new drive
and I was like, okay,

530
00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.310
I'll just sell windows eight
from scratch and test it

531
00:24:12.310 --> 00:24:14.050
out and see what I
think. And cause I heard

532
00:24:14.050 --> 00:24:15.730
some complaints. Right. I hear
people complaining that, you know,

533
00:24:15.730 --> 00:24:18.460
basically it's two different. They're
not sure what people like

534
00:24:18.460 --> 00:24:22.090
it it's two tablets, but
I really, really like it.

535
00:24:22.090 --> 00:24:25.630
Like, I, I think it's
clearly better. Like I would

536
00:24:25.630 --> 00:24:27.190
almost go so far as
to say this is, I

537
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:32.680
think the best UI iteration
they've done since windows 95,

538
00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:36.130
you know, maybe the only
action that they've done since

539
00:24:36.130 --> 00:24:38.620
windows 95. Right. Right. And
when was the last time

540
00:24:38.620 --> 00:24:41.650
they changed this much stuff?
No. I mean, honestly windows

541
00:24:41.650 --> 00:24:44.890
seven and windows 95, other
than the task bar, which

542
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:46.630
I think windows is windows
seven is kind of like

543
00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.170
gift to the world because
you can see, you know,

544
00:24:50.190 --> 00:24:52.960
the way that the doc
in, in an iOS is

545
00:24:53.050 --> 00:24:55.120
in the task bar and
windows seven are kind of

546
00:24:55.120 --> 00:24:57.820
converging under one thing and
now unity and the way

547
00:24:57.820 --> 00:25:00.070
that doc works in and
two, I mean effectively, the,

548
00:25:00.070 --> 00:25:03.460
everyone has a dock now
and then you've got Metro

549
00:25:03.460 --> 00:25:06.520
on windows eight and you've
got kind of launchpad on

550
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.880
iOS. It's all just a
different way to look at

551
00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:13.540
your icons, you know, ultimately,
Well, right. And I had

552
00:25:13.540 --> 00:25:18.040
been beefing for awhile on
Twitter about the iPhone iOS

553
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:21.460
UI, which is basically it's
a desktop area with a

554
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:25.060
field of icons. I was
like, okay, that's windows 3.1.

555
00:25:25.150 --> 00:25:27.970
Literally it's a, it's a
field with a bunch of

556
00:25:27.970 --> 00:25:30.160
icons on it. And they're
not even that dynamic. That

557
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:31.900
was my other beef was
like, if you look at

558
00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:34.390
the iOS apps, like the
calendar app shows the current

559
00:25:34.390 --> 00:25:37.720
date, which some people don't
even notice that actually. But

560
00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:41.200
the, the, the pictures icon
does not show you your

561
00:25:41.200 --> 00:25:44.950
current picture. Right. So shows
that generic, whatever sunflower. So

562
00:25:44.950 --> 00:25:46.900
I've learned to look for
that sunflower, but I would

563
00:25:46.900 --> 00:25:48.580
rather see one of my
pictures in there, like one

564
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.260
of the things that I
thought was obvious was that

565
00:25:50.530 --> 00:25:52.660
you want these tiles to
be dynamic, right. If they're

566
00:25:52.660 --> 00:25:54.970
icons just have them do
stuff, right. Like I don't

567
00:25:54.970 --> 00:25:58.420
need to see the mail
icon 50,000 times. Right. Show

568
00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.020
me something else in that
space that's useful. And I

569
00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:05.350
think windows eight and of
course the windows phone does

570
00:26:05.350 --> 00:26:08.020
that beautifully. Like when I
hit the windows key, you

571
00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:09.580
know, I get the, basically
the windows keys, what I've

572
00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.380
used, the new start menu,
new start menu is now

573
00:26:11.410 --> 00:26:15.100
full screen and it's in
Metro visual style, but it's

574
00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:16.660
showing me all this information.
I see the current day.

575
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.250
And I see the weather.
I see, you know, all

576
00:26:18.250 --> 00:26:20.380
this stuff like is live
and updating and I'm like,

577
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.080
that's cool. Right. That's a
really good use of screen

578
00:26:23.080 --> 00:26:26.620
space. Isn't it? Chalk? Isn't
it jarring though? I mean,

579
00:26:26.620 --> 00:26:28.360
that's the one thing I
can't get my brain around

580
00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:31.330
is that I'm sitting here
with three monitors. And while

581
00:26:31.330 --> 00:26:34.630
I get the idea of
a tablet that is a

582
00:26:34.630 --> 00:26:37.060
windows tablet, let's move on
all my windows seven stuff.

583
00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:39.100
And then has this Metro
thing for the days when

584
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:40.510
I just want to like
check the news and full

585
00:26:40.510 --> 00:26:43.180
screen. But, and I know
you're a big on, you

586
00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.360
know, you don't like window
management and if you can

587
00:26:45.360 --> 00:26:48.000
avoid it and they're kind
of the moving around and

588
00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:51.420
shoving around of windows is
not, that's really the most.

589
00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:54.180
It's the, it's the biggest
busy work that we do

590
00:26:54.180 --> 00:26:56.190
in our lives is just
moving a window from one

591
00:26:56.190 --> 00:26:58.800
side or the other. So,
you know, things like iOS

592
00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:00.840
and windows eight will prevent
a lot of that kind

593
00:27:00.840 --> 00:27:03.000
of a work. But when
you're sitting on the desktop

594
00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.650
and you hit the start
menu just to go and

595
00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:08.700
run something, it's like switching
into an alternate, alternate dimension.

596
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.340
It's so jarring. How is
that going to work across

597
00:27:11.340 --> 00:27:13.380
three monitors? You know, do
I need that kind of

598
00:27:13.590 --> 00:27:16.700
stress in my life? Well,
does it, I haven't, I've

599
00:27:16.700 --> 00:27:18.470
only, I've only tried on
laptops. I haven't actually tried

600
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:20.660
it on my multi-monitor setup.
Does it? I would assume

601
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:24.020
it only replaces the primary
monitor. I believe they, I'm

602
00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:26.090
not sure. And I'm sure
I'll be wrong. Cause that's

603
00:27:26.090 --> 00:27:28.130
how it works on podcasts.
You say something and then

604
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:29.870
he get an email later
that you're wrong. But I

605
00:27:29.870 --> 00:27:32.330
believe that whatever your mouse
is, is where it will

606
00:27:32.330 --> 00:27:35.120
bring that menu up. Okay.
Well, I read, there's a

607
00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.670
really good article on this
by Peter Bright. Who's a columnist

608
00:27:37.670 --> 00:27:42.440
at ours, technical world's angriest
columnist, but he, he is

609
00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:44.210
a good columnist and he
wrote a lot about this

610
00:27:44.210 --> 00:27:46.310
and the multi-monitor stuff. Cause
they're actually, this is the

611
00:27:46.310 --> 00:27:49.220
first version of windows that
actually has decent multi-monitor support.

612
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.010
I mean, other than it
just working, it actually has

613
00:27:52.010 --> 00:27:54.140
like, Oh, the taskbar extends
to all the monitors, right?

614
00:27:54.140 --> 00:27:56.690
Like I actually thought about
it more than getting it

615
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:59.960
basically working. And it's still
better than, you know, O

616
00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:03.110
S 10 because no, one's
10. You have, you have

617
00:28:03.110 --> 00:28:06.320
that menu strip at the
top of the monitor that

618
00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:08.660
menu strip does not scale.
Well, when you have like

619
00:28:08.690 --> 00:28:11.330
three monitors that you have
like a menu in the

620
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:14.480
far, far left upper corner
of your, the first of

621
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:17.870
three, three monitors. So they're
not the first company to

622
00:28:17.870 --> 00:28:19.310
sort of struggle with, you
know, how do we get

623
00:28:19.310 --> 00:28:22.130
our UI to extend to
multiple honors, but I'm also

624
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:26.330
a realistic and pragmatic. And
then I view not that

625
00:28:26.330 --> 00:28:28.220
many people are going to
have multiple monitors. I mean,

626
00:28:28.220 --> 00:28:30.610
some people might set up
like a second monitor, but

627
00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.300
the people like me who
have three monitors are kind

628
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.850
of freaks in a good
way, I think, but I

629
00:28:34.850 --> 00:28:37.460
can totally understand that they
do. They aren't exactly optimizing

630
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:39.410
for this case. And I
can't really begrudge them that

631
00:28:39.410 --> 00:28:41.150
because it's, We are the
ones. I mean, that, that

632
00:28:41.150 --> 00:28:43.640
is the thing. All of
us are the 1% case.

633
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:45.080
This is the thing that's
killing me. People are getting

634
00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:46.550
all mad at me and
they're tweeting me and they're

635
00:28:46.550 --> 00:28:48.530
like, Oh, I can't believe
Microsoft is doing that. You

636
00:28:48.530 --> 00:28:50.120
know, but then they've got
these stats. So I like

637
00:28:50.150 --> 00:28:54.500
0.1% of people use this
feature. And that's always the

638
00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:57.560
feature that the person is
enraged about, you know? And

639
00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.190
that's great when the problem
is when 100% of people

640
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:06.680
who are me use that
feature. That's very frustrating. Yeah,

641
00:29:07.310 --> 00:29:09.800
it is. But as a
new start menu, I quite

642
00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:12.710
like the Metro UI. I
mean, even if I don't

643
00:29:12.710 --> 00:29:14.510
get into the whole everything
running in Metro, just as

644
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:16.340
a new star menu, it's
pretty win because I can

645
00:29:16.340 --> 00:29:18.020
start typing, you know, and
it matches a bunch of

646
00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.390
stuff and it's a really
elegant way to just type

647
00:29:20.390 --> 00:29:22.700
like I, you know, and
find things that hasn't gone

648
00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:26.750
away. There's also like core
improvements. Like ISO files are

649
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.030
now. Like I don't have
to run a special software

650
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.510
to freaking Mount ISO images
anymore. Many years have been

651
00:29:32.510 --> 00:29:35.300
waiting for that. What do
you think about that new

652
00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:38.630
motion thing that everyone's talking
about? The connect competitor, it's

653
00:29:38.630 --> 00:29:40.610
like a little mouse looking
thing you put in front

654
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:43.690
of your PC. I Didn't
read much about that, but,

655
00:29:43.740 --> 00:29:45.490
but I read that it
can detect like really tiny,

656
00:29:45.490 --> 00:29:50.280
tiny finger motion, one millimeter
or something. Yeah. It's like,

657
00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.840
you know, I've got to
connect in front of my

658
00:29:51.840 --> 00:29:55.800
windows machine here that I
won in a contest and

659
00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:58.860
I'm waiting for that, that
thing, you know, like the

660
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.810
software that makes that happen.
Like, all I want to

661
00:30:00.810 --> 00:30:02.850
do is like, I'm looking
at a Skype window with

662
00:30:02.850 --> 00:30:04.260
you in it. I want
to just put my hand

663
00:30:04.260 --> 00:30:07.320
up and then just make
a flicking motion And move

664
00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:10.110
that to the left. Like
that seems like a driver

665
00:30:10.110 --> 00:30:14.490
that should be built in,
you know, I'd really have

666
00:30:14.490 --> 00:30:17.310
to play with that. I
mean, connect is obviously like

667
00:30:17.310 --> 00:30:20.160
a 10 foot UI big
time. Right? So like, I

668
00:30:20.160 --> 00:30:22.050
don't even know how that
would extend, Not the new

669
00:30:22.050 --> 00:30:24.750
one, not the new one.
So the new connect supports,

670
00:30:25.110 --> 00:30:28.140
they call it near mode.
So you get skeletal tracking

671
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:31.350
of seated people a foot
away. So there's the windows

672
00:30:31.350 --> 00:30:34.410
connect is different than the
Xbox can. Well, but then

673
00:30:34.410 --> 00:30:36.660
there's that competitor you're talking
about that actually is designed

674
00:30:36.690 --> 00:30:41.010
least motion. Yes, that's right.
I don't know. I'd have

675
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:43.890
to play with it. I
don't know. I mean, I've,

676
00:30:44.370 --> 00:30:46.650
after using the iPad, I've
definitely warmed up to touch

677
00:30:46.650 --> 00:30:50.730
as like a casual consumption
interface. It certainly works great

678
00:30:50.730 --> 00:30:55.200
for that. It's absolutely horrible
for, for typing any kind

679
00:30:55.200 --> 00:30:57.630
of content. Yeah. I think
that rather than saying that

680
00:30:57.630 --> 00:31:00.150
the era of the mouse
and keyboard are over, I

681
00:31:00.150 --> 00:31:02.850
think it's the era of
something else. Like you can't

682
00:31:02.850 --> 00:31:05.100
say that it's all about
touch because we don't know,

683
00:31:05.490 --> 00:31:08.490
like we all have these
webcams pointing at us. I

684
00:31:08.490 --> 00:31:10.590
don't know why I need
a second webcam. Like I've

685
00:31:10.590 --> 00:31:13.290
got this perfectly good webcam
and I've got eight processors

686
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:17.220
despair. Just detect that. I'm
moving my hand and move

687
00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:19.740
that window off to the
side. Right. We have all

688
00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:24.030
the, all the technology is
in place, the fast processors

689
00:31:24.030 --> 00:31:27.390
and the webcams. Well, I
don't think the webcam is

690
00:31:27.390 --> 00:31:28.890
quite enough because if you
look at connect, it has

691
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:32.040
like a depth sensors. It
has infrared sensors. I mean,

692
00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:33.750
the reason connect was so
cool was it had like,

693
00:31:33.750 --> 00:31:36.810
I think three different kinds
of sensors. I mean, camera

694
00:31:36.810 --> 00:31:38.970
as well as some other
stuff. Yeah. So I think

695
00:31:38.970 --> 00:31:41.370
we'd need that as well
for that to truly take

696
00:31:41.370 --> 00:31:43.410
off. Yeah. I think I'm
a little jaded. I just

697
00:31:43.410 --> 00:31:45.990
feel like The hardware, there's
so much hardware in front

698
00:31:45.990 --> 00:31:47.640
of us and there's just
so little software to do

699
00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:51.030
the work, But I don't
know why people are beefing

700
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.700
so hard about windows eight.
Like everything, almost everything I

701
00:31:53.710 --> 00:31:55.710
seen it like, like there's
the tech, the new task

702
00:31:55.710 --> 00:31:59.940
manager is awesome. It's got
the office 2007 style UI

703
00:31:59.940 --> 00:32:02.250
on the Explorer, which I
love. I've always loved that

704
00:32:02.250 --> 00:32:06.930
UI. I think it's way
better than traditional menus at

705
00:32:06.930 --> 00:32:10.350
boots faster. It loads faster.
It sleeps faster. It's like,

706
00:32:10.350 --> 00:32:12.210
what's not to like, really,
this is like maybe the

707
00:32:12.210 --> 00:32:15.360
best version of windows I've
ever seen the bootstraps party.

708
00:32:15.390 --> 00:32:17.310
So they're freaking out about
the boot faster part is

709
00:32:17.310 --> 00:32:21.450
crazy. Yeah. The thing comes
back from boot faster than

710
00:32:21.450 --> 00:32:25.320
it comes back from hibernation.
Like, I don't know, like

711
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:26.940
this has been a couple
of times when it's actually

712
00:32:26.940 --> 00:32:29.310
come back from boot so
fast, I've been suspicious that

713
00:32:29.310 --> 00:32:32.370
it was sleeping. Well, I
would recommend that anybody listening

714
00:32:32.370 --> 00:32:34.500
really try out the preview.
I mean, I'm, I really

715
00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:36.660
like it. I, I would
argue maybe it's the best

716
00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:39.380
version of windows there has
ever been. And one of

717
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:41.810
my complaints has been with
windows seven, certainly with Vista.

718
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:43.580
This was a huge complaint.
And with windows seven too,

719
00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:46.340
they didn't really change enough.
You know, they didn't really

720
00:32:46.340 --> 00:32:49.850
innovate. They didn't do enough
stuff. Whereas windows eight, they

721
00:32:49.850 --> 00:32:52.580
clearly did a lot of
stuff. They rethought a lot

722
00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.730
of the way things are
working. And I dig it,

723
00:32:55.730 --> 00:32:58.870
man. I'm not there. I'm
not there yet, man. I'm

724
00:32:58.870 --> 00:33:02.980
not there. Yeah. I don't
know. We'll see. I did

725
00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:05.050
train my wife in it.
I actually watched or observed

726
00:33:05.050 --> 00:33:06.400
her. There are a few
things you have to learn.

727
00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.680
Like the corners. The main
thing that I would mention

728
00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:10.750
is you got to know
that the corners are hot

729
00:33:11.470 --> 00:33:13.780
and that's sort of how
you activate things. It's kind

730
00:33:13.780 --> 00:33:15.190
of like, I think once
you figure it out, you

731
00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:18.010
know it, but I can
see where people are complaining

732
00:33:18.010 --> 00:33:19.660
that like, maybe you need
like a giant arrow saying,

733
00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:22.240
Hey, drag your mouse to
the corners. Right. Remember when

734
00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:24.280
windows 95 started out, what
was the first thing that

735
00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.370
happened when you started up?
Is that an arrow animated

736
00:33:27.370 --> 00:33:29.710
across the bottom of the
task bar to point at

737
00:33:29.710 --> 00:33:34.360
the giant button that says,
You know, trivia, I actually

738
00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.430
was following windows 95, really
close to when it came

739
00:33:36.430 --> 00:33:38.890
out, I read like this
book about windows 95. I

740
00:33:38.890 --> 00:33:40.150
read it cover to cover
like three times. Cause I

741
00:33:40.150 --> 00:33:42.210
was like a little obsessed
actually with it. I probably

742
00:33:42.210 --> 00:33:45.310
shouldn't admit this, but I
was really obsessed with windows

743
00:33:45.310 --> 00:33:46.540
95. I was like, Oh
God, this is gonna be

744
00:33:46.540 --> 00:33:49.450
great. And I had emailed
somebody at Microsoft and I

745
00:33:49.450 --> 00:33:51.790
got a response from the
guy who wrote that feature.

746
00:33:52.150 --> 00:33:54.280
Like there was something on
newsgroup or something. And this

747
00:33:54.280 --> 00:33:56.650
was back when people, people
were Microsoft still read news

748
00:33:56.650 --> 00:33:59.260
groups, I guess. And he
was actually talking about it.

749
00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:01.330
Cause that start thing, like
I had never seen it

750
00:34:01.330 --> 00:34:04.060
and he clarified something. He
actually emailed me back about

751
00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:09.070
that feature. So I was
pretty slim. I think you're

752
00:34:09.070 --> 00:34:11.110
a fan boy though. It
sounds like you're officially a

753
00:34:11.110 --> 00:34:14.860
windows eight fan boy are
almost there. I think so.

754
00:34:15.430 --> 00:34:17.440
I like it a lot
more than I thought I

755
00:34:17.450 --> 00:34:19.960
would. Now that that's set
up. I still mentioned earlier,

756
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:21.220
just so that you don't
think I'm a total Feb,

757
00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:24.490
I'm probably going to switch
to Mac. Yeah, I did.

758
00:34:24.490 --> 00:34:27.160
I did catch that part
of the conversation earlier. Yes.

759
00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:28.690
So I'm a little bit
of both, you know, I

760
00:34:28.690 --> 00:34:31.480
like whatever works, man, whatever.
I just want there to

761
00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:34.330
be innovation basically. Right. And
I think the retina displays

762
00:34:34.330 --> 00:34:37.000
hugely innovative, hugely waiting for
that for years. I think

763
00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:38.770
windows eight is actually very
innovative and the way that

764
00:34:38.770 --> 00:34:40.930
they're changing the way the
start menu works, the way

765
00:34:40.930 --> 00:34:43.930
that the corners are hot,
which know fits law, all

766
00:34:43.930 --> 00:34:46.450
that stuff. And you know,
the new design language of

767
00:34:46.450 --> 00:34:49.270
Metro I think is very
cool. So I think we're

768
00:34:49.270 --> 00:34:51.250
definitely a view. And I
agree on that. It is

769
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:53.410
about innovation. I just want
things to keep being interested

770
00:34:53.410 --> 00:34:55.870
in keeping useful. And my
number one focus is that

771
00:34:55.870 --> 00:34:58.570
things need to care about
the user. Anything that is

772
00:34:58.570 --> 00:35:02.980
user hostile. I get really
angry. Well, even one of

773
00:35:02.980 --> 00:35:05.110
the things I like about
Apple actually is that I

774
00:35:05.110 --> 00:35:08.350
feel like they're willing to
sort of put the customer

775
00:35:08.350 --> 00:35:11.500
over the developers, even, you
know, even, even if the

776
00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:13.570
developers, you know, are kind
of the goose that lays

777
00:35:13.570 --> 00:35:15.970
the golden egg. In some
ways, Apple is not shy

778
00:35:15.970 --> 00:35:18.700
about giving their developer community
kind of basically finger, right?

779
00:35:18.730 --> 00:35:20.950
Like in the name of
the customer, it's like they

780
00:35:20.950 --> 00:35:23.230
have to protect the experience.
And if they have to

781
00:35:23.230 --> 00:35:26.500
protect experience by telling the
developers to go away, like

782
00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:28.810
this whole, the way the
app store on the Mac

783
00:35:28.810 --> 00:35:31.780
is totally locked down now.
Right. And developers are really

784
00:35:31.780 --> 00:35:33.700
pissed off about that, but
they're not shy about saying,

785
00:35:33.710 --> 00:35:35.980
you know what? This is
about the user first. Right?

786
00:35:36.010 --> 00:35:38.540
We can't, we're not about
