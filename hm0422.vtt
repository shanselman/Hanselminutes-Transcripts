<inaudible> From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel

8
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:51.500
minutes. Oh, weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:56.270
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 22. In

10
00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:00.170
this episode, Scott talks with
David Starr about applying agile

11
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:05.780
practices to manage your family
life. Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:07.790
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and I'm

13
00:01:07.790 --> 00:01:10.820
talking with David star formerly
of Microsoft, but now the

14
00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:14.120
COO of scrum.org. So you
are an expert in scrum

15
00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:17.120
aren't you I'm been doing
scrum for quite a long

16
00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:21.110
time. Scott do. So does
that makes you a scrum

17
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:23.360
master? I know that people
who are listening probably have

18
00:01:23.360 --> 00:01:25.700
heard of scrum master training
and things like that, are

19
00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.430
we ever really masters of
anything? I don't know. Scrum

20
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.450
master is a role within
scrum and a lot of

21
00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:36.080
people associate that term with
the whole idea of using

22
00:01:36.080 --> 00:01:39.410
scrum. So I get it
scrum masters, that thing out

23
00:01:39.410 --> 00:01:42.200
there. So when I think
of scrum originally, I thought

24
00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.780
of, you know, a rugby
scrum, a coming together, a

25
00:01:44.780 --> 00:01:48.800
planning, and then going and
then racing off. Can you

26
00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:51.080
tell me where that fits
into the larger kind of

27
00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.350
agile software methodology? Well, it's
actually a really good metaphor

28
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.630
for what scrum asks us
to do, which is everyone

29
00:01:56.630 --> 00:01:58.790
keep their eye on the
ball if you will. And

30
00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:02.150
we sort of support each
other and work together as

31
00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.880
a group. And that's the
whole idea behind those rugby

32
00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:08.090
scrums, right? We're focusing as
a team on one small

33
00:02:08.090 --> 00:02:11.060
point to target all of
our energy together. And that's

34
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.880
sort of the metaphor idea
behind scrum, which doesn't stand

35
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.530
for anything. A lot of
people think it does it

36
00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:19.610
doesn't. And it actually was
borrowed from that move in

37
00:02:19.610 --> 00:02:23.270
rugby where everyone forms a
scrum and focuses together. So

38
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:26.180
in terms of where does
it fit within the agile

39
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:31.430
toolbox? There is the idea
of iterative incremental development practices.

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:34.250
Scrum is one of these
and it means that we

41
00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:38.450
make progress in a series
of sprints or, you know,

42
00:02:38.450 --> 00:02:40.160
we focus for a while.
Then we deliver it and

43
00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.870
we focus for a while.
Then we deliver and we

44
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:43.760
do that on a regular
cadence. And that's a little

45
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.880
bit different than what you
find with alternative things like

46
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:51.140
lean Kanban systems, stuff like
that. So folks that have

47
00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:53.300
been listening for the last
two minutes might think that

48
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.760
this is going to be
a show on scrum as

49
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.830
it relates to software. But
the thing that you and

50
00:02:57.830 --> 00:03:00.910
I have in common is
that we've got Families with

51
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.070
schedules and a lot of
crazy things going on, and

52
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.610
we're also focused on productivity
in our personal lives. So

53
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:09.550
this is not a show
about scrum as it is

54
00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:13.570
a show about agile family
practices and applying what we

55
00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:17.680
learn in managing projects to
managing a family. How did

56
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.120
you get this idea? Well,
I don't know about your

57
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.450
personal life, but in mind
when I bring something home

58
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:27.240
from the office, it's very
rarely met with any sort

59
00:03:27.240 --> 00:03:30.870
of enthusiasm, right? If I
were to walk into my

60
00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:34.650
wife's, you know, into the
living room and say, Hey,

61
00:03:34.650 --> 00:03:36.690
I got this great idea
from this management thing I

62
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:39.090
learned at work today, that's
pretty much a nonstarter for

63
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:42.960
the conversation. So that's where
I tried to bring scrum

64
00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:45.630
into our home. Many years
ago, I learned this from

65
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:49.470
originally back around 2003, four
when everyone else did and

66
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:52.650
had some successes at work
and thought, you know, I

67
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.370
saw such amazing changes in
behavior with people I work

68
00:03:56.370 --> 00:03:59.070
with based on very little
simple things that we do

69
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.690
that I'd like to try
some of this at home.

70
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:02.790
So I brought it home
and said, Hey, honey, what

71
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:05.070
do you think about these
ideas? And she said, don't

72
00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:10.410
even try it. And instead
I tried it because as,

73
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.480
as I'm sure, you know,
neither one of us can

74
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:16.500
leave well enough alone, right?
Yeah. Yeah. So while she

75
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.570
was out one day, this
is a great story. You

76
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:20.490
should ask her sometime while,
while she was out one

77
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.400
day before she got home,
I had gone ahead and

78
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:27.090
taken some big drywall screws
and, and screwed a cork

79
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:29.910
boards and whiteboards into the
wall in the kitchen. And

80
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.320
while that may have been
a little disruptive to get

81
00:04:34.320 --> 00:04:37.440
things off and running, it
worked really well over time.

82
00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:40.710
And now actually, my wife's
a huge advocate of, of

83
00:04:40.710 --> 00:04:43.010
some of these practices. And
I'll tell you, we, we

84
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:45.510
don't use scrum. We don't
use lean. We don't use

85
00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:49.380
a Kanban or any sort
of formal thing. We just

86
00:04:49.380 --> 00:04:52.560
have borrowed from all of
these practices into some things

87
00:04:52.560 --> 00:04:55.020
that we do in our
home that really have made

88
00:04:55.020 --> 00:04:58.920
a difference for how my
kids manage themselves and the

89
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.870
expectations of being a good
family member Picture here. How

90
00:05:03.870 --> 00:05:05.850
old are the kids? How
big of a family is,

91
00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:08.820
this is a Brady bunch
situation. It's pretty large. Yeah.

92
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:11.160
My, my wife and I've
been married for 23 years

93
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.730
at this point and we've
got four kids right now.

94
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.440
The ages are 13, 14,
15, 16. So four teenagers.

95
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:23.670
Wow. Which is, you know,
it's own barrel or kettle

96
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:26.220
of fish, if you will.
And then no barrel of

97
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.010
monkeys. Yeah. The barrel of
monkeys. There you go. So

98
00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:31.560
when we started doing all
of this, though, the children

99
00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.870
were much younger. This was
about 10 years. We've been

100
00:05:33.870 --> 00:05:37.210
doing this. So kids at
that time, whereas young as,

101
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:42.990
you know, four or five,
and we even had some

102
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.320
kids that weren't reading well,
and we tried different different

103
00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:49.830
techniques for different ages. And
so we've definitely evolved how

104
00:05:49.830 --> 00:05:55.410
we, how we do this
family practice together over the

105
00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.190
years and putting the kids
in charge of that evolution

106
00:05:58.190 --> 00:06:01.220
has been a really big
thing. So I can tell

107
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:04.790
you, there've been some constants
over the years that we

108
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:07.130
hang our hats on is
this is what we do.

109
00:06:07.130 --> 00:06:10.460
And, and, and those are
pretty simple. Every week we

110
00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:13.760
have a family meeting and
we look at what we

111
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.040
did that we sort of
reflect on the last week.

112
00:06:16.550 --> 00:06:20.780
And then we give allowance,
which is a completely unrelated

113
00:06:20.780 --> 00:06:22.850
thing, but it kind of
breaks up the meeting. And

114
00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:25.850
then the second or rather
the third part is we

115
00:06:25.850 --> 00:06:28.760
look ahead and plan out
the next week. So life

116
00:06:28.760 --> 00:06:32.300
for us because, you know,
I work a regular nine

117
00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:35.780
to fiver kind of like
you and the kids go

118
00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:39.110
to school. Life for us
happens in weekly increments or

119
00:06:39.110 --> 00:06:42.500
weekly sprints. And so we
find that a once a

120
00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:45.530
week, having that family meeting
to reflect on how things

121
00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.470
are going and then to
plan the next week is

122
00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:53.410
perfect timing for us. When,
when I think of scrum

123
00:06:53.410 --> 00:06:56.260
in a company perspective, I
think about it moving a

124
00:06:56.260 --> 00:06:59.560
single product forward. I feel
like people kind of go

125
00:06:59.560 --> 00:07:02.380
off. They work on their
user stories. They work on

126
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:05.830
their, their features, right. Their
silos, but then they come

127
00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.470
back and they integrate. But
with a family of teenagers,

128
00:07:08.470 --> 00:07:10.210
I would think that they
would all, they would all

129
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:12.850
have different goals and there
would be no company goal.

130
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.450
I think you'll actually find
that condition far more often

131
00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:20.050
than in development teams than
we'd like to admit that

132
00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.190
said, sure, I agree with
you. This is not a

133
00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:27.670
product where, what is the
product, I guess, is really

134
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:30.490
your question here. And the
product in our case is

135
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:32.890
the family. So we're all
part of this family. We

136
00:07:32.890 --> 00:07:38.320
have that in common and
you know, the real life

137
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:43.180
that happens is a result
of how we steward that

138
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:47.470
product forward. In other words,
there are things that agile

139
00:07:47.470 --> 00:07:50.350
teams do that we want
our family to do. We

140
00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:53.920
want to focus more on
what's coming next, then what's

141
00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:57.640
coming a long time from
now, for example, another example,

142
00:07:57.670 --> 00:08:00.790
we want to focus more
on what is and use

143
00:08:00.790 --> 00:08:03.040
that in our decision making
rather than what should be.

144
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.250
You know, these are things
that typical management techniques have

145
00:08:06.250 --> 00:08:08.260
known for years. And so
we've just kind of borrowed

146
00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.680
them. My wife and I
talk a little bit in

147
00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.430
our relationship tips show. I
had her on Hansel minutes,

148
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:19.780
a number of times about
having a, a com a

149
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.900
company, a family mission statement.
We basically made it a,

150
00:08:22.990 --> 00:08:27.460
a, a, a marital mission
statement. And ours was to,

151
00:08:27.470 --> 00:08:31.240
to have a happy life
with no drama. And, you

152
00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:33.340
know, everyone's mission statement is
going to be different. It

153
00:08:33.340 --> 00:08:35.620
might be getting all the
kids through college, or it

154
00:08:35.620 --> 00:08:39.880
might be, you know, retiring
quickly and traveling, is that

155
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.640
your product? Have you guys
got a plan like that?

156
00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:44.230
Like you've got teenagers. So
it's was like, you know,

157
00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:48.070
get all these kids into
school. Well, there's sort of

158
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.780
our sardonic way of looking
at it. One is, and

159
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.450
that is for my wife
and I, we want them

160
00:08:52.450 --> 00:08:55.920
alive at 25. You know,
that's, that's big deal is

161
00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.590
to make sure we have
happy, healthy, productive members of

162
00:08:58.590 --> 00:09:03.120
society. And for us, while
we haven't sat down to

163
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:05.850
codify that into a mission
statement, like I know a

164
00:09:05.850 --> 00:09:09.030
lot of families do, we've
talked about it, a great

165
00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:11.580
deal. And what we want
is for our children to

166
00:09:11.580 --> 00:09:15.180
learn how to be self
sufficient and sustaining adults and

167
00:09:15.180 --> 00:09:19.500
members of society, that's our
job, right? And everything we

168
00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:23.130
do is in light of
that to teach these folks

169
00:09:23.130 --> 00:09:26.940
how to begin to be
people on their own and

170
00:09:26.940 --> 00:09:30.500
dealing with their own lives.
Okay. So if I want

171
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:34.400
to implement agile practices or
scrum within my, my house,

172
00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.530
what do I have to
do? There's, there's the way

173
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.960
of changing my brain, but
then there's also thinking about

174
00:09:39.710 --> 00:09:43.010
what tools I might want
to use. Well, sure. Tools

175
00:09:43.010 --> 00:09:45.830
are, are a part of
it. And I think for

176
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.790
my family, it's very simple.
We just bought a new

177
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.100
house. And one of the
things that we had as

178
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.230
part of our move in
for that new house is

179
00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:56.990
we had a painter come
in and actually paint an

180
00:09:56.990 --> 00:10:00.560
entire wall of our kitchen
as a magnetic whiteboard. So

181
00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.650
that's our tool and that'll
be the tool in the,

182
00:10:03.650 --> 00:10:05.870
in the new house going
forward. We've always had some

183
00:10:05.870 --> 00:10:09.890
kind of board like that
near our dining room table.

184
00:10:09.890 --> 00:10:11.690
And the reason we choose
to put it near the

185
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:13.610
table is because that's where
we come together as a

186
00:10:13.610 --> 00:10:17.570
family. And so it's that
information, radiator thing that we've

187
00:10:17.570 --> 00:10:20.720
learned from agile practices that
says, if I can see

188
00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.730
it, then we talk about
it. And if we talk

189
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.710
about it, then we do
something about it. And so

190
00:10:24.710 --> 00:10:28.910
we try and keep information
omnipresent as we get when

191
00:10:28.910 --> 00:10:31.400
we get together naturally over
dinner and stuff. And that

192
00:10:31.430 --> 00:10:36.410
that's been very helpful. I,
I think you could go

193
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:41.240
a lot of different ways
with applying practices like these.

194
00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:45.830
First of all, I don't
think that work in home

195
00:10:45.830 --> 00:10:49.490
are the same. They're definitely
not. Firstly, you can't Are

196
00:10:49.730 --> 00:10:52.820
anybody at home, Not an
option, no one gets voted

197
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:55.820
off the Island. And that
turns out to be incredibly

198
00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.240
big difference. Another big difference
is that much of the

199
00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:02.300
work that we asked that
we ask kids to do

200
00:11:03.110 --> 00:11:07.280
is often wrote or repetitive
and boring, clean your room

201
00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:11.390
is simply not creative work.
Right? But then again, oftentimes

202
00:11:11.390 --> 00:11:16.100
neither is tweaking the server
configuration settings so that, you

203
00:11:16.100 --> 00:11:18.020
know, performance goes up, but
it's something that has to

204
00:11:18.020 --> 00:11:21.350
be done. So those are
just little tasks sorts of

205
00:11:21.350 --> 00:11:24.770
things. And what we've learned
is that different kids respond

206
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:28.730
to different artifacts or different
tools for that rote work.

207
00:11:28.820 --> 00:11:31.100
Some kids really like a
little card that they're going

208
00:11:31.100 --> 00:11:33.710
to move back and forth.
Some kids really like a

209
00:11:33.710 --> 00:11:36.980
checklist. And it's important for
us to give the kid

210
00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:41.120
a whatever tool they're most
comfortable with, but also to

211
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:46.460
hold the kids accountable collectively
for things getting done. So

212
00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.440
there are two types of
work that sort of chore

213
00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:51.260
work. That's where most people
focus, they think about chores.

214
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:53.740
How do I get my
kid to do those things?

215
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:57.700
So again, checklists there, but
that's not really the secret

216
00:11:57.700 --> 00:12:01.630
sauce of this. You know,
the ability to get everyone

217
00:12:01.630 --> 00:12:04.060
to focus and get their
chores done is great. But

218
00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.670
how much better is it
when we start doing things

219
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:09.520
like asking the kids to
peer review, each other's work

220
00:12:09.970 --> 00:12:12.490
that starts to change the
dynamic a little bit because

221
00:12:12.490 --> 00:12:14.140
a kid will come back
and say, you know, Hey,

222
00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:16.390
wipe the bathroom down. Or
I put the dishes away

223
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:20.080
or I cleaned the kitchen
and the response is great.

224
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:21.880
Let me go check it
because I happen to know

225
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.670
that this kid will often,
you know, leave some work

226
00:12:24.670 --> 00:12:27.160
undone, that sort of thing.
And so instead, what if

227
00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:28.840
I just have a, what
if I ask one of

228
00:12:28.840 --> 00:12:31.060
the other kids, Hey, can
you go check so-and-so's work?

229
00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:36.670
And that starts to build
collective accountability and little things

230
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:42.040
like that. And borrowing from
our management practices have really

231
00:12:42.070 --> 00:12:43.750
helped the kids start to
stand on their own a

232
00:12:43.750 --> 00:12:47.830
bit more. I think, you
know, this got about my

233
00:12:47.830 --> 00:12:49.630
family. You and I have
discussed this at one point.

234
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.620
I have some kids on
the autistic spectrum and this

235
00:12:54.100 --> 00:13:00.040
practice of the weekly cadence
and the dependable, or the

236
00:13:00.040 --> 00:13:04.330
fact that they can depend
on a way for us

237
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:07.900
to have a conversation about
us has really made a

238
00:13:07.900 --> 00:13:11.080
big difference in their lives
because they now feel more

239
00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:13.570
in control and empowered in
their own lives. So that's

240
00:13:13.570 --> 00:13:17.740
been really great. So that,
that reliability, that the idea

241
00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.780
that, that we can count
on the weekly meeting, you

242
00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:21.730
can count on the strategy.
You can count on the

243
00:13:21.730 --> 00:13:25.570
plan and then execute on
the indeed. Yeah. And you

244
00:13:25.570 --> 00:13:28.690
know, it sounds, it may
sound extreme, but the first

245
00:13:28.690 --> 00:13:30.850
thing to consider is all
we're really doing is we're

246
00:13:30.850 --> 00:13:33.520
putting things on the refrigerator
like everybody has done, you

247
00:13:33.520 --> 00:13:36.820
know, for Ian's, here's your
chore list. That's the easy

248
00:13:36.820 --> 00:13:39.520
stuff. The next stuff is,
what can we accomplish together

249
00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:42.610
as a family each week
in our family, we choose

250
00:13:42.610 --> 00:13:45.700
to set a goal and
it might be in, it's

251
00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:47.920
just some sort of improvement
goal that we as a

252
00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:51.580
family can undertake. And it's
simple things. It's things like

253
00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.710
we will endeavor this week
to have better table manners.

254
00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.260
And so that's an opportunity
for us to learn about

255
00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:02.260
what table manners really means.
And we will have that

256
00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:06.430
conversation throughout the week. And
then in our weekly meeting

257
00:14:06.850 --> 00:14:09.220
where we say, how did
we do this week, we'll

258
00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:13.510
specifically visit that goal. How
did we do on the

259
00:14:13.510 --> 00:14:16.480
goal this week of learning
better table manners? And we'll

260
00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:18.550
talk about that. And sometimes
we'll choose to try it

261
00:14:18.550 --> 00:14:21.730
for another week. And that
has been a really nice

262
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:27.850
tool for helping us improve
together as a family, rather

263
00:14:27.850 --> 00:14:32.380
than focusing on individual accomplishments.
Because while everybody has these

264
00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.810
things in their lives that
they have to accomplish, like

265
00:14:35.380 --> 00:14:38.200
a history report is due,
or I have to go

266
00:14:38.200 --> 00:14:41.590
to track practice, or I'm
working towards some other goal

267
00:14:41.590 --> 00:14:45.280
in life. The thing that
we have in common is

268
00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:49.240
us and it's, it's good
and effective for us to

269
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:52.640
focus on improving us. So
that's why I say the

270
00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.350
product is the family. What
is the product backlog? Then

271
00:14:57.280 --> 00:15:00.910
The product backlog is for
us that that set of

272
00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:05.950
chores, which, you know, that's
the easy part again. But

273
00:15:06.190 --> 00:15:10.600
every day we have this
expectation that a bucket of

274
00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.210
chores is going to be
completed. And so that's done.

275
00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.050
But then we start looking
at things beyond that, the,

276
00:15:17.050 --> 00:15:19.630
the goal that we just
talked about or something for

277
00:15:19.630 --> 00:15:21.520
us to work on this
week, the weekly goal, that's

278
00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:25.000
a big part of what
it means for us to

279
00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:29.380
focus together. So we have
a backlog of potential weekly

280
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:33.220
family goals, and we might
choose to for a given

281
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.370
week, but we also in
that backlog have things that

282
00:15:36.370 --> 00:15:41.770
we have to accomplish together
that are more non-deterministic. You

283
00:15:41.770 --> 00:15:46.720
could call it even more
creative style work. So some

284
00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.290
things might be, we are
going to volunteer this weekend

285
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:55.030
at something, and we need
to prepare for that. I

286
00:15:55.030 --> 00:15:57.010
mentioned that my family and
I had just bought a

287
00:15:57.010 --> 00:15:59.710
new house. Well, we have
to move. And so that's,

288
00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:03.340
that's a project. So we
built a backlog and it

289
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:08.230
turns out that kids rooms
are, are a smaller and

290
00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:10.690
have fewer things in them
than a lot of the

291
00:16:10.690 --> 00:16:12.430
other rooms in the house.
So we have to do

292
00:16:12.430 --> 00:16:14.860
this together. This is not
something that just affects one

293
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.860
person. So moving was a
really good example. I think,

294
00:16:17.860 --> 00:16:21.100
of a shared project. Where
do you put this backlog?

295
00:16:21.310 --> 00:16:22.870
I mean, how far do
you take it? I could

296
00:16:22.870 --> 00:16:25.990
see someone, you know, building,
you know, using scrum tools

297
00:16:25.990 --> 00:16:28.870
and building out a backlog.
And is the backlog just

298
00:16:28.870 --> 00:16:31.120
post us, like you said,
or magnets on the fridge,

299
00:16:31.150 --> 00:16:33.730
or do you use tools
like Trello or different Kanban

300
00:16:33.730 --> 00:16:38.170
boards? So I'm sure like
you, I have tried for

301
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.260
years to get folks in
my family. Okay. Particularly my

302
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:46.300
wife to work with me
on, on systems like Trello

303
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.330
or a sauna, or it
just doesn't work. She's, she's

304
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:55.180
a very analog person and
that's perfectly fine. So we

305
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:58.300
do everything on a whiteboard
and we just have a

306
00:16:58.300 --> 00:17:01.690
list. That's all, it's not
very complicated, but I will

307
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:05.560
tell you that it has
helped a lot for the

308
00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:09.760
kids to evolve what the
form is of those tools

309
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.130
over the years. So if
a kid has an idea

310
00:17:12.130 --> 00:17:15.010
that if we're going to,
that will do better. If

311
00:17:15.010 --> 00:17:18.640
we, if we use sticky
notes, instead of just making

312
00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.470
a list on the whiteboard,
then let them do it.

313
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:23.650
That means that they're engaged
in the process, invite them

314
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:27.490
to change what we do.
The only hard and fast

315
00:17:27.490 --> 00:17:31.330
tenants of what we do
in our family is we're

316
00:17:31.330 --> 00:17:33.430
going to meet every week.
We're going to have that

317
00:17:33.430 --> 00:17:37.810
shared family goal. We have
baseline expectations of daily operations,

318
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:42.610
like chores, et cetera. But
within those boundaries, feel free

319
00:17:42.610 --> 00:17:46.750
to innovate and help us
evolve and innovate differently than

320
00:17:46.750 --> 00:17:49.410
the way we're doing business
today. And the kids love

321
00:17:49.410 --> 00:17:54.900
that When, when companies, companies
have values and they have

322
00:17:54.900 --> 00:17:57.120
things that they just kind
of stand for, that's kind

323
00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:00.990
of the more woo kind
of philosophical stuff. Sure. How

324
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:03.870
do you take things like
that that are, you know,

325
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.350
philosophical is the word I
keep coming back to, although

326
00:18:07.350 --> 00:18:09.120
I don't think it's the
correct word. And how do

327
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.220
you bring that into the,
the, the daily, the daily

328
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.440
goals and the larger goals?
Well, we talk about it

329
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.750
a lot. That's one thing.
And so what are some

330
00:18:17.750 --> 00:18:22.490
of those things we talk
about reflecting on the work

331
00:18:22.490 --> 00:18:25.820
we do and on how
we do it. We actually

332
00:18:26.030 --> 00:18:28.430
talk about that at home.
And I asked the kids,

333
00:18:28.490 --> 00:18:31.190
how did you do this
week at school? What did

334
00:18:31.190 --> 00:18:36.950
you get done? And we
have very focused conversations where

335
00:18:36.950 --> 00:18:39.650
we inspect and then make
a plan or adapt for

336
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:42.320
what are we going to
do next? And then we

337
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:45.710
try really hard, Scott. This
is the one thing that

338
00:18:45.710 --> 00:18:48.650
I think eludes us even
to this day is trying

339
00:18:48.650 --> 00:18:51.560
to succeed or fail as
a team. And that's easy

340
00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:53.540
enough to do that when
you're looking at the family

341
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:58.400
goal and something like table
manners, or, you know, taking

342
00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:00.680
care of the yard this
week, it's easy enough to

343
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:04.790
see there. But over time,
the real truth is that

344
00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.960
we are all living different
lives. And so group accountability

345
00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:13.100
for the family is sometimes
a difficult thing to find.

346
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.730
And we try my wife
and I really hard to

347
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:22.220
find ways to hold us
accountable as a group. So

348
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:25.580
that's, that's something that we
talk about a lot and

349
00:19:25.580 --> 00:19:28.280
we have it on our
whiteboard. We have a, we

350
00:19:28.280 --> 00:19:32.270
haven't written out there, we
succeed together. We reflect on

351
00:19:32.270 --> 00:19:35.330
our work and how we
do it. Some other things

352
00:19:35.330 --> 00:19:37.850
that you'll, you might find
at any given time on

353
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:42.080
the big, you know, family
headquarters board in our kitchen

354
00:19:42.080 --> 00:19:47.450
area is adapt all the
time. I can change the

355
00:19:47.450 --> 00:19:50.690
process if I want those
sorts of things that we

356
00:19:50.690 --> 00:19:53.480
put up there occasionally just
to remind kids that they

357
00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.080
really are in a control
seat on how we do

358
00:19:57.080 --> 00:20:03.530
our business. Do, when you
say accountable, where does that

359
00:20:03.530 --> 00:20:06.290
fit into punishment? Like, there
are things where, Hey, I

360
00:20:06.290 --> 00:20:08.870
didn't clean my room and
that's a bummer. And then

361
00:20:08.870 --> 00:20:11.960
there are larger, like you
were given this task and

362
00:20:11.960 --> 00:20:13.640
this was required for you
to get this done and

363
00:20:13.640 --> 00:20:15.470
this didn't get done. And
that is a huge problem.

364
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:19.730
Yeah. Well, it turns out
that what works at work

365
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:21.770
works because it works not
because you're at work, you

366
00:20:21.770 --> 00:20:25.160
know, and You had that
one ready to go, didn't

367
00:20:25.160 --> 00:20:27.290
ya? I did. I did.
I've been holding onto that.

368
00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.490
It's one of my favorites,
but that's really true because

369
00:20:31.490 --> 00:20:34.730
we have found that, you
know, the practices that work

370
00:20:34.760 --> 00:20:38.450
best in team environments work
because we're all human. Right.

371
00:20:39.110 --> 00:20:42.170
And so it turns out
that a big part of

372
00:20:42.170 --> 00:20:48.610
accountability is simply transparency. If
a kid commits to action

373
00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:51.850
or behavior for a 24
hour period. And I shouldn't

374
00:20:51.850 --> 00:20:55.510
say a kid by the
way, because my kids do

375
00:20:55.510 --> 00:20:59.620
a good job of holding
me accountable. So if I

376
00:20:59.620 --> 00:21:02.530
make a commitment that I
am going to go to

377
00:21:02.530 --> 00:21:05.230
the gym in the next
24 hours and then 24

378
00:21:05.230 --> 00:21:07.930
hours from now, we get
together in a quick little

379
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.210
family huddle, which we haven't
talked about. It's something we

380
00:21:10.210 --> 00:21:12.940
try to do on a
fairly daily basis. And the

381
00:21:12.940 --> 00:21:15.880
kids will look at my,
my little section of the

382
00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:17.880
board. And I've, I've written
that commitment down. When I

383
00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:19.330
go to the gym, they'll
say, daddy, did you go

384
00:21:19.330 --> 00:21:23.890
to the gym? And if
I didn't, then everybody in

385
00:21:23.890 --> 00:21:26.140
the family knows it. And
the truth of the matter

386
00:21:26.140 --> 00:21:30.430
is that that's typically enough.
It doesn't have to be

387
00:21:30.430 --> 00:21:33.640
punitive because if it's punitive
and then we're talking about

388
00:21:33.640 --> 00:21:38.530
extrinsic motivators and the extrinsic
motivators, you gotta use them

389
00:21:38.530 --> 00:21:40.270
a lot of times, particularly
when kids are in their

390
00:21:40.270 --> 00:21:43.080
teen years, you know, carrot
and stick stuff. Can we,

391
00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:44.520
can we, can we talk
a little bit about that?

392
00:21:44.520 --> 00:21:46.640
Because I don't know if
everyone understands that word. Sure.

393
00:21:46.650 --> 00:21:50.610
Sorry. So if I'm intrinsically
motivated to do something, it's

394
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.980
just part of who I
am. In my core, I

395
00:21:52.980 --> 00:21:57.990
am intrinsically motivated to, you
know, be a good dad

396
00:21:58.020 --> 00:22:04.500
to be a software professional,
things like that. External motivations

397
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.080
are things that give me
a reward for a given

398
00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:10.710
behavior. Nobody's going to pay
me to sit down and

399
00:22:10.710 --> 00:22:15.630
watch or learn a new
technology necessarily. And so that

400
00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:19.320
is something I do for
my own intrinsic motivation. But

401
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.920
if I have to learn
technology that I don't like,

402
00:22:23.430 --> 00:22:25.140
because that's what it's going
to take to get my

403
00:22:25.140 --> 00:22:29.120
job done. My extrinsic motivator
there is, Hey man, I'm

404
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:31.200
gonna lose my paycheck. If
I don't learn how to

405
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:35.730
do this thing, whatever it
may be. So intrinsic extrinsic

406
00:22:36.480 --> 00:22:40.320
simply means, am I motivated
from internally? Or is there

407
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:42.570
something external to me that's
sort of holding my nose

408
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:45.690
to the grindstone. I see.
And it turns out that

409
00:22:45.690 --> 00:22:49.680
you're going to get far
better performance from internally or

410
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:55.110
intrinsically motivated people. And it's,
that's the secret sauce in

411
00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:57.240
all of this, whether you're
at work or whether you're

412
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:02.340
at home is finding a
way to intrinsically or help

413
00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.970
with intrinsic motivation and people.
And man, Scott, it's so

414
00:23:05.970 --> 00:23:09.990
much harder in kids than
adults, but that really is

415
00:23:09.990 --> 00:23:13.260
our job, right? As parents
is to try and help

416
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:17.340
them want to improve and
help them improve because they

417
00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:20.700
see the importance of it
in life. And I think

418
00:23:20.700 --> 00:23:23.370
that that's made a great
translation or transition from the

419
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:26.070
workspace into our house. Yeah.
My kids are a little

420
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:28.710
younger. Of course my kids
are six and eight, but

421
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.740
we've been really working on
this idea of, of intrinsic

422
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.840
motivation. Like, you know, do
this because it's the right

423
00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:36.720
thing to do. My wife
has started using our last

424
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.300
name. Like, you know, we
do this because we're Hanselman

425
00:23:39.330 --> 00:23:42.150
like this sense of, of
family pride, which is funny

426
00:23:42.150 --> 00:23:45.060
because it wasn't her original
last name, but she's really

427
00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:48.620
like taking that as a
call to arms and a

428
00:23:48.650 --> 00:23:50.810
cause what's happening is you're
getting to the age now

429
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:55.490
where they're noticing other kids
doing stuff that's not, not

430
00:23:55.490 --> 00:23:59.450
cool. Right. And we're trying
to nip that hole, but

431
00:23:59.450 --> 00:24:03.260
so-and-so does it, you know,
thing in the bud and

432
00:24:03.830 --> 00:24:06.080
by, by trying to get
them some sense of family

433
00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:09.380
pride or, you know, would
it be family pride or

434
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.260
cultural pride or Oregonians or,
you know, whatever we can

435
00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:15.670
use. We're a tribe, man.
It's, it's, we're a tribe,

436
00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:18.970
right? Yeah, exactly. Yeah. Look,
it's like, you want them

437
00:24:18.970 --> 00:24:20.860
to think about the greater
good and you want them

438
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:23.260
to think about the world,
but they're six and eight.

439
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:27.190
Right. You know, their, their
priorities are pretty minimal. Like

440
00:24:27.190 --> 00:24:29.320
right now, if they can
get the next great action

441
00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.290
figure, that is going to
be enough motivation for them.

442
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.440
So we can't get them
thinking about the greater good

443
00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:37.300
when they really don't know
what's outside their neighborhood, but

444
00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:41.080
we can get them thinking
about, you know, this is

445
00:24:41.080 --> 00:24:43.990
not okay because of, because
it's not okay with me,

446
00:24:43.990 --> 00:24:46.060
even though it might be
okay for other people. It's

447
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.450
funny. They, they, they really
concerned about smoking right now.

448
00:24:49.510 --> 00:24:51.910
None of us smoke, no
one we know smokes, but

449
00:24:52.450 --> 00:24:56.020
they know it's bad. So
the six year old was

450
00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:58.960
walking at the mall and
we saw someone who's smoking

451
00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.350
outside and we passed him
and he goes, That guy

452
00:25:02.350 --> 00:25:06.640
is smoking Because I think
a guy hurt him and

453
00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.710
the mall hurt him. And
it's just like, Oh, well.

454
00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:10.540
And so then it's like,
well, how do you explain

455
00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:13.990
to them that personal, you
know, you have personal freedom,

456
00:25:14.710 --> 00:25:16.390
even though we, we choose
not to do it. So

457
00:25:16.390 --> 00:25:18.430
you don't want to be
judgmental, but at the same

458
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.940
time, you gotta keep the
eye on the prize. I

459
00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.200
totally get that. Yeah. And
I think that that summarizes

460
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:32.170
exactly our challenges, parents is
helping our kids understand that

461
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:35.050
we do a lot of
things we do just because

462
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:38.440
it's the right thing to
do. And yeah, that's, that's

463
00:25:38.440 --> 00:25:42.220
the whole nut of intrinsic
motivation. I agree. Yep. Absolutely.

464
00:25:43.450 --> 00:25:45.700
I've tried to get my
wife using Trello for some

465
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:47.980
of these things, but she
has decided that it is

466
00:25:48.310 --> 00:25:52.810
not intuitive. So that's why
as far as I've gotten

467
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:55.150
with that, I like the
idea of formalizing a family

468
00:25:55.150 --> 00:25:59.050
meeting. We do have, we
do have dinner together every

469
00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.710
night, which is useful. And
we also use driving in

470
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:04.750
the car as a time
to check. She calls it,

471
00:26:04.750 --> 00:26:07.540
checking in. It's like, all
right, let's just check in.

472
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:10.270
So that's our, that's our
scrum. It's basically, you know,

473
00:26:10.270 --> 00:26:12.010
every other day, whenever we
find ourselves in the car

474
00:26:12.010 --> 00:26:14.650
for more than 10 or
20 minutes, is yours a

475
00:26:14.650 --> 00:26:18.550
formal, like it's time for
the family meeting. We actually

476
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:22.060
do similar things now. And
that's an experimentation that we've

477
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.330
been doing. So it has
been far more formal over

478
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:27.790
the years. And recently we've
had just a lot of

479
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.580
turmoil because as our kids
have gotten older, they're all

480
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:34.930
into various activities, sports plays
after school, that sort of

481
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:38.890
thing. And so like you,
we've always tried very hard

482
00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:41.500
to have dinner together as
a family. That's a tenant

483
00:26:41.620 --> 00:26:45.900
in our life. And we
use that time now to,

484
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:49.350
as you said, sort of
check in, but visit the

485
00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:51.780
activities of the week or
the commitments that we've made

486
00:26:51.780 --> 00:26:54.960
for the week. And so
that's why we put those

487
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:59.700
information radiators or that board
with all of our information

488
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:01.770
on it, near the dinner
table so that we can

489
00:27:01.770 --> 00:27:05.790
have that conversation really easily.
As we sit there and

490
00:27:05.790 --> 00:27:08.480
have a relaxing meal together.
I'm going to take you

491
00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:10.370
off into a direction though.
Cause you just said something

492
00:27:10.370 --> 00:27:12.020
that you, you have a
lot of great information, but

493
00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:16.130
sometimes guests have words or
phrases or acronyms that they

494
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:18.560
throw out because that's part
of their life. But the

495
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:21.200
rest of us don't get
them. You just said information

496
00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:27.140
radiators. That's a great term.
Yeah, it's, it's good. It's

497
00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:29.900
a term that we also
borrow from the agile community.

498
00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:33.080
And it is simply the
notion that if I put

499
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:36.740
something large, invisible in a
shared space where we can

500
00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:41.180
all see it, and that
thing changes to show different

501
00:27:41.270 --> 00:27:46.010
information under different circumstances, we
will pay attention to it.

502
00:27:46.010 --> 00:27:48.050
And if we begin to
pay attention to it, we

503
00:27:48.050 --> 00:27:51.860
will then change our behavior
to game that thing, which

504
00:27:51.860 --> 00:27:55.880
might be as simple as
a, you know, the continuous

505
00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:59.000
integration build lava lamp that
goes on when my build

506
00:27:59.000 --> 00:28:01.760
fails, that's a perfect right.
I have the thing called

507
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:03.830
the siren of shame. You
can buy the, you know,

508
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:07.910
so, so an information radiator,
would that be like a,

509
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:10.610
at my wife and I
recently got Fitbits that is

510
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:13.850
radiating information telling me that
I am not being physically

511
00:28:13.850 --> 00:28:16.490
active enough. I don't think
so. Actually I think that's

512
00:28:16.490 --> 00:28:18.710
more of a sensor. I
think if what you did

513
00:28:18.710 --> 00:28:21.710
is you hooked that sensor
into some system that, you

514
00:28:21.710 --> 00:28:25.220
know, put a large screen
TV on your living room

515
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.070
wall, and everybody could see
what Scott was walking that

516
00:28:28.070 --> 00:28:31.100
day or your step counts
thus far today. Now you're

517
00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:36.170
talking about radiating information to,
you know, the, the ether

518
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.380
in our home or in
our office. And now everybody

519
00:28:39.380 --> 00:28:43.010
sees that and we might
choose to behave differently because

520
00:28:43.010 --> 00:28:45.950
of that information. So when
you think about scrum teams,

521
00:28:45.950 --> 00:28:48.230
they have those, those boards,
right. That they put on

522
00:28:48.230 --> 00:28:51.710
the wall then, and often
you'll see columns like to

523
00:28:51.710 --> 00:28:55.070
do doing done. Those are
information radiators. I see. So

524
00:28:55.070 --> 00:28:57.650
the idea is that it
has to be, everyone has

525
00:28:57.650 --> 00:29:00.440
to see it. It has
to be an organizational value

526
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.860
and everyone sees it and
everyone can kind of imply

527
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:06.710
either they're there. They can
give their, their judgment in

528
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:08.420
the sense of like he
didn't, he didn't get that

529
00:29:08.420 --> 00:29:10.520
project done. I can see
the burn down, but at

530
00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:12.740
the same time, offer help,
like, Oh, I can see

531
00:29:12.740 --> 00:29:14.360
that you're having trouble with
the build failing. And I

532
00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.850
can come in with collective
ownership and assist on that.

533
00:29:17.450 --> 00:29:21.710
Indeed. That's exactly right. And
it's funny you bring up

534
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.260
information radiators. You're keyed on
that because it's a big

535
00:29:24.290 --> 00:29:29.060
part of why I started
getting into this agile conversation

536
00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:31.820
in the first place. I
was at an organization where

537
00:29:31.820 --> 00:29:35.330
we were shipping 300 known
defects in our flagship software.

538
00:29:35.810 --> 00:29:39.230
And over the course of
18 months, we got to

539
00:29:39.230 --> 00:29:43.150
zero known shipping defects. The,
we did that is that

540
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.610
I wired up a lava
lamp because I happen to

541
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.910
live like lava lamps apparently
to our bug tracking system.

542
00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:52.840
And anytime we started every
sprint, we would start our

543
00:29:52.840 --> 00:29:56.290
sprint with the light on
and you had to fix

544
00:29:56.290 --> 00:29:58.120
bugs until the light went
off and then you could

545
00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:02.230
build new features. And I
simply would lower the tolerance

546
00:30:02.470 --> 00:30:08.290
of defects a little bit
every week. And that information

547
00:30:08.290 --> 00:30:11.800
radiator let everyone know that
it was either time to

548
00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:16.720
fix bugs or time to
work on new features. And

549
00:30:17.350 --> 00:30:20.470
it changed everything about our
team dynamic and it all

550
00:30:21.010 --> 00:30:26.200
stemmed from that and seeing
the power of such a

551
00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:32.400
simple concept. Interesting. So just,
just the, the, it wasn't

552
00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:34.170
in your way, trying to
say it wasn't in your

553
00:30:34.170 --> 00:30:36.120
face in the sense of
it. Wasn't a mandate. There

554
00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:38.790
we go. This is not
a mandate to change behavior.

555
00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:41.940
It's a gentle nudge in
a direction by simply presenting

556
00:30:41.940 --> 00:30:44.910
information in a way, and
then allowing people to make

557
00:30:44.910 --> 00:30:48.270
their own judgements and then
change their behavior Because it

558
00:30:48.270 --> 00:30:53.310
turns out that if you
have well meaning engaged folks

559
00:30:53.310 --> 00:30:56.190
and they see that information
in front of them, they'll

560
00:30:56.190 --> 00:31:00.120
do something about it. Very,
very cool. Have you written

561
00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:02.430
some of this up about
applying agile practices of the

562
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:04.290
family, or can people look
at your website and learn

563
00:31:04.290 --> 00:31:06.720
more about this on your
blog? So this has been

564
00:31:06.720 --> 00:31:09.870
a bizarre thing because what
started as something of a,

565
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:11.910
I mean, it's just something
we do in my family.

566
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:16.350
It's never really been big
drama. And I published an,

567
00:31:16.350 --> 00:31:20.280
I triple a paper about
this in 2009 and it

568
00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:25.470
received some, some interesting attention.
I received a call one

569
00:31:25.470 --> 00:31:27.990
day from many Bruce filer
who turns out to be

570
00:31:27.990 --> 00:31:30.990
a New York times author and
some folks on the show

571
00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:33.450
or some listeners I'm sure
have heard of him. He

572
00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:36.540
came and ended up visiting
my home. He stayed with

573
00:31:36.540 --> 00:31:38.760
my family for a week
and sort of watched our

574
00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:42.990
activities. And we're the first
chapter in his book called

575
00:31:42.990 --> 00:31:45.660
the secrets of happy families.
It's all about how we

576
00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:51.990
do this stuff. And that
had that, that created even

577
00:31:51.990 --> 00:31:54.540
more interest in this thing
that the stars were doing.

578
00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:58.140
So I started getting email
from all over the world,

579
00:31:58.140 --> 00:32:01.800
people asking little questions about
it. And accordingly I said,

580
00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:04.830
you know, I need to
take a little time, put

581
00:32:04.830 --> 00:32:08.490
this into some kind of
course or something that people

582
00:32:08.490 --> 00:32:11.130
can approach and get it
out there. And that way

583
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:13.980
I can go back to
my real job. And so

584
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:17.370
I happened to be a
Pluralsight author and they were

585
00:32:17.370 --> 00:32:19.440
interested enough to let me
do this. I built a

586
00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:25.290
course called I think it's
agile for families on pluralsight.com.

587
00:32:25.290 --> 00:32:29.520
If you go to family
V next.com, you'll get there

588
00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:33.660
Family. V-necks like version next.
That's correct. That is a

589
00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.930
great URL family V next
to own it in a

590
00:32:36.930 --> 00:32:38.550
redirect right to the Pluralsight.
So if you have a

591
00:32:38.550 --> 00:32:41.870
plural site subscription, you can
get a trial and you

592
00:32:41.870 --> 00:32:45.050
can check that out up
there. Agile families, techniques for

593
00:32:45.050 --> 00:32:47.000
living with change looks like
it's about a three hour

594
00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:50.630
course and it's five star
course. Very cool. And actually,

595
00:32:50.630 --> 00:32:52.340
if you do have a
Pluralsight, you can also take

596
00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:54.320
a look at my stuff
on getting involved in tech.

597
00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:57.440
So good opportunity to sign
up for a free Pluralsight

598
00:32:57.440 --> 00:33:01.100
trial today. Hey, Andy and
I was really excited because

599
00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.430
my wife chose to do
this with me. And so

600
00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:07.130
it, this is not for
geeks and geeks, I think

601
00:33:07.130 --> 00:33:11.750
are, are particularly enamored of
things like this, but this

602
00:33:11.750 --> 00:33:14.390
was done in such a
way that would help you

603
00:33:14.390 --> 00:33:18.650
Scott convince your wife that
we're not crazy. I brought

604
00:33:19.310 --> 00:33:21.680
my wife into the course.
She plays an active part

605
00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:23.780
and she's actually gone out
and done some talks and,

606
00:33:23.810 --> 00:33:28.270
and is definitely an advocate
for these sorts of things.

607
00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:32.690
That's very cool. I had
an article on my blog

608
00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.790
recently and I, I referred
to the gender nonspecific nontechnical

609
00:33:37.790 --> 00:33:41.840
spouse, right? And I haven't
got a, a shorter word

610
00:33:41.840 --> 00:33:43.760
for it, but this is,
this is just that person

611
00:33:43.760 --> 00:33:46.490
in your life who is
your partner, but is not

612
00:33:46.490 --> 00:33:50.240
technical. And we call them
neurotypicals around the star house

613
00:33:50.750 --> 00:33:53.570
typicals. Nice. Those are people.
Those are people who are

614
00:33:53.570 --> 00:33:58.250
afraid of keyboards normies, right?
No army. Very cool. Well,

615
00:33:58.250 --> 00:33:59.990
thank you so much, David
Starr for chatting with me

616
00:33:59.990 --> 00:34:03.530
today. Been lovely. Thanks, Scott.
This has been another episode

617
00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:05.750
of Hansel minutes and we'll
see you again next week.

618
00:34:06.130 --> 00:34:12.760
