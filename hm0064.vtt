11
00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:19.400
talks with Lynda Weinman at
mixed Oh seven. Hi, this

12
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.620
is Scott Hanselman, and this
is another episode of Hansel

13
00:01:21.620 --> 00:01:25.910
minutes. I'm here at the
mixed conference in Las Vegas,

14
00:01:26.270 --> 00:01:28.850
and I am fortunate enough
to be here with Linda

15
00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:33.170
Wineman from the world famous
lynda.com, L Y N D

16
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.560
a.com. And if you are
a.net developer and you are

17
00:01:36.830 --> 00:01:40.310
listening to this podcast, you
very likely have never heard

18
00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:43.640
of lynda.com. Would you say
Linda That's very true. We

19
00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:47.210
don't have any dotnet training.
So tell me about linda.com

20
00:01:47.210 --> 00:01:49.910
because for me as someone
who originally started out doing

21
00:01:49.910 --> 00:01:55.320
HTML and CSS, you know,
12, 13 years ago, when,

22
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:58.490
when lynda.com came out, that
was a gold mine of

23
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:00.860
information. How long has it
been up On the internet

24
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:04.520
now? I guess it'll be
12 years this December. So

25
00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:07.310
we're older than eBay, older
than a lot of websites.

26
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.060
I think microsoft.com was probably
a little bit before us,

27
00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:13.700
but not much. And then
if you kept all that

28
00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:16.610
content, I mean, I remember
that your, a web safe

29
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:19.220
color palette was like legendary.
I mean, it was the

30
00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:21.950
only one out there for
the longest time, those kinds

31
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:25.400
of documents still available. I
think we have archives of

32
00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:27.260
the website, but you know,
I've written a lot of

33
00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:29.780
books and most of my
research was put into those

34
00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:32.300
books. And of course I
have old copies that have

35
00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:35.690
gone out of date, but
the information is almost no

36
00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:38.960
longer, even that relevant. I
mean, the website pallet really

37
00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.370
is not relevant anymore. Back
in the day when, you

38
00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:47.270
know, people had displays, it
couldn't even display 32 bit

39
00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:50.240
color. That was when we
needed the web safe pallet.

40
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.290
No, not really. It's not
necessary. No mine has been

41
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:56.960
having trouble with colors looking
one way on a Macintosh

42
00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.380
and one way on a
PC. Well, that wouldn't be

43
00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:02.170
solved by using The web
safe pallet. That is just

44
00:03:02.170 --> 00:03:06.630
the fact that there are
different settings actually on the

45
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.560
displays work differently, color spaces
work differently. Exactly. So you,

46
00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:14.940
you all guys offer training@lynda.com.
You're primarily what HTML web

47
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:19.260
design CSS. We're not. That
was where I made my

48
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:23.790
Mark and got my name,
but I actually started in

49
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.020
the business in motion graphics
and animation. And I wrote

50
00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.810
one of the very first
books on web design. And

51
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:33.240
so I became well known
in the industry for web

52
00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:35.730
design, but I actually have
a lot of broader knowledge

53
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:40.680
about computer graphics. And in
the last few years, probably

54
00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.980
the last seven or eight
years, our website has branched

55
00:03:43.980 --> 00:03:50.100
out and we do digital
photography, digital video, 3d, everything

56
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:54.050
to do with imaging print,
web, all kinds of, So

57
00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:58.110
just a complete design center.
Is it true? I read

58
00:03:58.110 --> 00:04:00.200
on Wikipedia that you worked
on return of the Jedi.

59
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:03.870
Yes. That's actually true as
an animator. Yes I did.

60
00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:05.940
So this is interesting because
myself as someone who was

61
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:09.330
originally a web designer and
became a programmer, I thought

62
00:04:09.330 --> 00:04:12.450
of you as kind of
a, of an HTML web

63
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:15.360
type designer. And now I'm
here sitting with you and

64
00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:17.580
I'm learning that you are
kind of a full service

65
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:22.800
design person. So the Silverlight
announcement that we've just come

66
00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.440
from just a few hours
ago must be huge. You

67
00:04:25.440 --> 00:04:28.830
must be. I think it's
really exciting that Microsoft is

68
00:04:28.830 --> 00:04:31.860
entering the space and I'm
very impressed with how far

69
00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:33.720
they've come in a year
because I was here last

70
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:37.410
year at mix and the
expression suite has gone through

71
00:04:37.410 --> 00:04:41.700
a lot of very significant
improvements and definitely the silver

72
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:45.780
line announcement is wonderful. Now
you're also a flash expert.

73
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:48.990
So how do you feel
about that? I mean, some

74
00:04:48.990 --> 00:04:52.530
people have have said that
Microsoft should just come out

75
00:04:52.530 --> 00:04:55.560
and say, we are challenging
flash in this space, but

76
00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:58.170
no one will actually come
out and say it. Do

77
00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:01.080
you think this is a
flat complimentary technology to flash?

78
00:05:01.110 --> 00:05:03.930
Is it a flash killer
as everyone's been been kind

79
00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:06.840
of saying stirring the pot
in the press? Well, I

80
00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.420
wish I had a good
answer for that. It originally,

81
00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.430
I didn't think it was
going to compete with flash

82
00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:13.290
very much because it seemed
to me that it was

83
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:17.970
more about desktop apps and
it was about web apps,

84
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.940
but the focus has shifted
now to the web and

85
00:05:20.940 --> 00:05:24.690
the fact that it's cross-platform,
I would definitely say that

86
00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:28.350
there will be a significant
group of people eyeballing this

87
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.680
technology that may have never
even considered flash. So I'm

88
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.810
not sure that it's going
to kill flash, but I

89
00:05:33.810 --> 00:05:37.140
think it's going to open
this industry, the interactive design

90
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.450
industry up to a whole
new market. Well, it's definitely

91
00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.660
hard to kill a product
that has a 97% browser.

92
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:47.430
What's the word there? Kind
of penetration. Yeah. I mean,

93
00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.530
it's huge. And the flash
nine, I guess, is now

94
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.350
on 80 or 84% of
browser. So yeah, I think

95
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:54.360
probably kill flash. Isn't the
right. Isn't the right term.

96
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:56.550
Yeah. And I mean, I
think there's room for everybody.

97
00:05:56.550 --> 00:05:59.870
I think think history has
shown that, I mean, Apple,

98
00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:03.080
Adobe and Microsoft have never
done better than they're doing

99
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.810
right now. All three companies
are doing really well and

100
00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:08.780
it's just a great period
of growth and innovation and

101
00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:11.270
they all sort of leapfrog
over each other and borrow

102
00:06:11.270 --> 00:06:13.490
from each other. And that's
just the way it's always

103
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.510
been, Will be. Now, do
you think that you'll be

104
00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.200
doing kind of Greenfield new
website development with Silverlight or

105
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.700
do you have a sense
that you might go back

106
00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:24.580
to existing websites where there's
maybe something that you wanted

107
00:06:24.580 --> 00:06:27.880
to accomplish, but couldn't that
Silverlight could potentially be added

108
00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:31.960
to, to augment an existing
website? So really good question.

109
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:34.480
I, I sort of imagine
more people are going to

110
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.040
be creating brand new properties
with silver light. It seems

111
00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:43.210
to me that the workflow
and the technology is so

112
00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:47.200
different than anything that's been
there before. And it's so

113
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.030
easy. I mean, I was
impressed that a lot of

114
00:06:49.030 --> 00:06:50.770
the demos that we saw
in the keynote today were

115
00:06:50.770 --> 00:06:54.940
created in three weeks. I
mean, that's so rapid and

116
00:06:55.030 --> 00:06:58.060
it's almost easier to start
from scratch and just, you

117
00:06:58.060 --> 00:06:59.920
know, work with that from
the ground up, I think,

118
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:02.800
than to redo something that's
already been Well, it sounds

119
00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:05.260
like if you already have
the video codec and they've

120
00:07:05.260 --> 00:07:09.430
constrained it rather than offering
a codec pack, they've said,

121
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.130
here are the one or
two video codecs we plan

122
00:07:12.130 --> 00:07:15.640
on using here's a control
that plays video automatically. So

123
00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.340
the video issue becomes then
a non, a non issue.

124
00:07:18.370 --> 00:07:21.940
Here's the encoder. It seems
that most of them are

125
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.770
just kind of scan. Most
of the demos we saw

126
00:07:23.770 --> 00:07:28.540
are scaffolding around video. So
they're allowing the concurrent display

127
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.110
and play a playback of
video automatically. I think that

128
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:34.120
most of the demos were
done with JavaScript as their

129
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.830
orchestration engine. I'm not sure.
I mean, I think I've

130
00:07:38.830 --> 00:07:44.050
seen a few different deployment
methods. It seems like some

131
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.450
of what I've seen is
just purely in silver light

132
00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:51.550
and it seems like they
have a really good framework

133
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.970
for building interactive video where
a lot of the hooks

134
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.400
and handles are just sort
of, so built in that

135
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.590
to add a feature is
just a matter of choosing

136
00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.200
it on a menu. It's
pretty idiot proof. I mean,

137
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:04.150
I was looking at that
going, wow, I want to

138
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:05.860
sit and play with that.
You know, it looks really

139
00:08:05.860 --> 00:08:08.740
easy. Now, the kinds of
developers that you usually work

140
00:08:08.740 --> 00:08:11.560
with, that, that you use
your services, your resources, your

141
00:08:11.560 --> 00:08:15.490
training, I assume that they're
probably not.net developers. Are they

142
00:08:15.850 --> 00:08:19.210
rails PHP lamp? You know,
I'm sure there are some

143
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.630
dotnet developers who work with
our service just to give

144
00:08:22.630 --> 00:08:26.950
you some background. We have
a subscription service@lynda.com and we

145
00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:30.730
have over 300 courses and
over a hundred different trainers

146
00:08:30.730 --> 00:08:34.870
and present a very deep
dives into, we're mostly known

147
00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:39.220
for Adobe technologies and Apple
technologies, but we do, you

148
00:08:39.220 --> 00:08:42.790
know, office and Vista and
a few Microsoft titles. We

149
00:08:42.790 --> 00:08:44.770
do have a blend title.
We do have an expression

150
00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:48.400
web title. We have we're
planning to come out with

151
00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:50.320
quite a bit more. That's
one of the reasons why

152
00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.320
we're here at mix is
we're recruiting different presenters and

153
00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:56.250
looking for different trainers to
create training on the, On

154
00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.680
our subscription service. So that
was my next question is

155
00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.200
if you have a lot
of flash and flex training,

156
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:04.260
are you going to just
play both sides for lack

157
00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:05.420
of a better way for
it? No, I don't think

158
00:09:05.420 --> 00:09:08.570
it's both sides because we've
always been agnostic. We have

159
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:11.360
a lot of Apple training.
We have corral, we have

160
00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.690
a lot of training in
the video space, Autodesk, and

161
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:19.850
you know, we do 3d.
We've really tried to never

162
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:23.450
be specific to any one
software vendor. We're a resource

163
00:09:23.450 --> 00:09:27.380
for end users. And I
don't think people really decide

164
00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:30.650
what to use down party
lines. I mean, very few

165
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.040
people only have Microsoft software
on their computer or Adobe

166
00:09:34.040 --> 00:09:37.040
software on their computer. So
we like to believe that

167
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.280
we're just a helpful resource.
We offer all of our

168
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:44.570
training in videos. So we
have over 18,000 different individual

169
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.080
movies on our website. Okay.
So here's an interesting question

170
00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:50.060
that begs the question. How
do you deliver that video?

171
00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.380
We deliver it via QuickTime.
It's progressive. It's not streaming.

172
00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:57.890
And you know, we've been
really happy with QuickTime, but

173
00:09:57.890 --> 00:10:01.730
we're definitely eyeballing. We're gonna
do some sample video in

174
00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.740
Silverlight. We're going to give
it a shot. Yeah. Seeing

175
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:08.180
how quickly they put together
a branded Silverlight player, apparently

176
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:09.980
in less than three weeks,
you can put together the

177
00:10:09.980 --> 00:10:14.180
lynda.com player. Now, the marketing,
the stuff that we built

178
00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:15.830
into the media and coder,
where you could have certain

179
00:10:16.070 --> 00:10:20.000
portions of the video marked
as chapter marks and then

180
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.500
control that via JavaScript. Very
impressive. I saw a demo

181
00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:27.290
on that and again, it
looks look so simple. Yeah.

182
00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:29.840
One of the things that
really blew me away of

183
00:10:29.840 --> 00:10:32.210
course, was the dynamic language
runtime. And that's really the

184
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:35.600
big surprise of the conference.
We'd speculated about it a

185
00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.200
little bit on this show.
And I realized a couple

186
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:41.810
of hours ago that you
could have a rails programmer

187
00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:46.460
or Ruby programmer who would
use Silverlight use blend, use

188
00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.160
Ruby for the back end,
and he'd never see a

189
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:51.950
C-sharp or VB, or he'd
never even need to see

190
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:54.590
visual studio if he, if
he didn't want to. No,

191
00:10:54.590 --> 00:10:58.070
I I'm really impressed. I
mean, I know last year

192
00:10:58.070 --> 00:11:01.190
at mics, it's still felt
to me like everything was

193
00:11:01.190 --> 00:11:04.850
going to go down Microsoft
party lines. In fact, I

194
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:07.580
had the honor of being
invited to a lunch last

195
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.170
year with bill Gates. And
that was one of my

196
00:11:09.170 --> 00:11:13.160
questions to him because I
had seen expression web. And

197
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.110
I was wondering if there
were ever any plans to

198
00:11:15.110 --> 00:11:18.320
work with outside technologies. You
know, I was, I asked

199
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.840
about PHP and rails and
he said, well, it wouldn't

200
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.300
be too hard to do,
but I didn't get the

201
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.180
impression that he was eager
to do it. And it's

202
00:11:26.180 --> 00:11:33.290
just so really to me,
a really good wind shift

203
00:11:33.290 --> 00:11:35.840
here, a really good C
shaped sea change that we're

204
00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:38.450
seeing, you know, to see
Microsoft open up a little

205
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:43.910
bit and recognize that they,
that they can still touch

206
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:49.430
people who aren't using everything,
you know, only down one

207
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:51.410
party line. And I, I
just don't think that's the

208
00:11:51.410 --> 00:11:54.190
way the world really works.
I think are looking at

209
00:11:54.190 --> 00:11:57.130
solutions. They're not, you know,
whatever works for them. If

210
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:01.150
they only have access to
Ruby programmers, then why force

211
00:12:01.150 --> 00:12:04.960
them to learn C sharper
to work in something different.

212
00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:08.560
So it just seems smart
to me that Microsoft, because

213
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.740
I think they've been perceived
for so long as everything

214
00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:15.790
referencing themselves, being self referential
and, you know, sort of

215
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:19.240
serving themselves. And so it's
really nice to see them

216
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.480
opening up and also opening
up and really getting the

217
00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.270
power of the web. That
was another big shift that

218
00:12:25.270 --> 00:12:29.500
I saw this year was
just recognizing that yeah, developers

219
00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500
have, you know, for years
built applications that are standalone

220
00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:35.440
applications, but really the whole
world has changed due to

221
00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.810
the web. And it's just
neat to see things opening

222
00:12:37.810 --> 00:12:39.870
up. I'm happy about it.
It was a, a good

223
00:12:39.870 --> 00:12:42.780
friend of mine, Chris cells,
who was a trainer for

224
00:12:42.780 --> 00:12:44.130
years and a book writer
for years. And he went

225
00:12:44.130 --> 00:12:46.500
to work for Microsoft and
he said something to me.

226
00:12:46.540 --> 00:12:48.270
I thought it was really
powerful. And I was reminded

227
00:12:48.270 --> 00:12:50.130
of it just now, when
you were saying what you

228
00:12:50.130 --> 00:12:53.070
were saying, which was that
he said, I've, I keep

229
00:12:53.070 --> 00:12:56.280
looking for the evil. You
keep wondering where the master

230
00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.280
plan meeting is happening. There
must be someone who's trying

231
00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.620
to take over the planet.
I mean, they are a

232
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:03.300
company and they do want
to make lots and lots

233
00:13:03.300 --> 00:13:08.220
of money, but the program
managers, the people here are

234
00:13:08.670 --> 00:13:11.040
genuinely, I mean, I sound
like a fan boy saying

235
00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.440
that, but they're genuinely interested
in making the web. Awesome.

236
00:13:14.310 --> 00:13:15.960
I think you're right. You
know, and that's such a,

237
00:13:15.980 --> 00:13:19.200
then that this conference, unlike
other conferences I've been to

238
00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.670
has been so such a
different, it's different vibe in

239
00:13:23.670 --> 00:13:26.160
the air. It's very positive.
It's very, Hey man, Hey

240
00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.560
man, do do what makes
you happy? You know, and

241
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:32.010
if that's JavaScript and rails
or whatever, that's great. I

242
00:13:32.010 --> 00:13:33.920
mean, like right now we're
having a podcast and someone

243
00:13:33.930 --> 00:13:37.590
is running a motorcycle, a
motorized remote control, car bias.

244
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:40.080
You know, it's just a
very kind of, it's a

245
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.350
love Fest. It's a, it's
a web enabled love festival.

246
00:13:43.380 --> 00:13:46.890
This one has this, this
year really has to me

247
00:13:46.890 --> 00:13:49.500
a very different flavor than
last year. And, and a

248
00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.900
lot of it to me,
I've, I feel like Ray

249
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:54.030
has kind of set a
different tone than bill Gates

250
00:13:54.030 --> 00:13:56.400
set. And I really that's
what I do. I mean,

251
00:13:56.400 --> 00:14:00.480
I, I think he just
appears to really understand that

252
00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:04.710
the web is about open
standards. It's about allowing everyone

253
00:14:04.710 --> 00:14:07.830
to participate in whatever way
they can. And they want

254
00:14:07.830 --> 00:14:11.520
to, rather than trying to
dominate the industry and have

255
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:15.150
everything relate back to sales,
into Microsoft's pocket. Cause in

256
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:17.850
reality, they aren't going to
get new market share this

257
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.160
way. They're going to get
new market share by opening

258
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:24.300
up to other platforms and
other technologies. It's really a

259
00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.750
nice, refreshing approach. That's interesting
that you say that about

260
00:14:27.750 --> 00:14:30.660
Ray Ozzie, because, because you
and I were at a

261
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:32.550
lunch today with Ray Ozzie,
which is where I met

262
00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.950
you. And then I said,
quick, quick, come on my

263
00:14:34.950 --> 00:14:39.570
podcast. And I had asked
Ray, what's your, what's your

264
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.930
five year plan? What's your
master plan? Surely, surely there

265
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:45.840
must be a master plan.
And he was so pragmatic

266
00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:50.220
about it. His master plan
was give the developers really

267
00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:53.600
awesome tools and kind of
listen to the wind and

268
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:57.110
see how things are going
and adjust as appropriate. And

269
00:14:57.230 --> 00:14:59.900
they will make good stuff
and I pushed him on

270
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:02.990
it and he's like, no,
no, really seriously. They're going

271
00:15:02.990 --> 00:15:06.260
to figure it out. It's
almost a, a meritocracy and

272
00:15:06.260 --> 00:15:09.610
it's a web wide meritocracy
Different because if you think

273
00:15:09.610 --> 00:15:13.120
back to the history with
Microsoft and kind of, you

274
00:15:13.120 --> 00:15:16.240
know, the whole battle between
Netscape and Explorer and just

275
00:15:16.630 --> 00:15:20.320
what has gone down to
date in that it felt

276
00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:23.350
like Microsoft was really trying
to own their version of

277
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:25.030
the web and everything was
going to be sort of

278
00:15:25.030 --> 00:15:29.020
like a Microsoft flavor and
really not a whole lot

279
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.710
of openness to wanting to
work with standards bodies. And

280
00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:35.500
that has just it's changed.
And it's so refreshing. I

281
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.860
mean, I'm really delighted actually.
It's like finding there's a

282
00:15:38.860 --> 00:15:42.400
new sandbox to play in,
you know, cause the industry

283
00:15:42.400 --> 00:15:45.400
is such a exciting industry
and I love being in

284
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:49.510
it. I love watching everything
change and seeing tools improve

285
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.750
and seeing the, all the
possibilities that are out there

286
00:15:53.050 --> 00:15:55.690
become, you know, into, you
know, just sort of be

287
00:15:55.690 --> 00:16:00.040
born. And so it's, it's
great to see them not

288
00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:03.670
be closed. I think they're
gonna find that they're gonna,

289
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:05.800
you know, get a lot
more market share that way

290
00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:08.530
actually. So here's a little
bit of a shift and

291
00:16:08.530 --> 00:16:11.650
a kind of a philosophical
question. As, as we start

292
00:16:11.650 --> 00:16:16.510
writing this XAML we start
writing each Silverlight applications or

293
00:16:16.510 --> 00:16:18.250
on the flash side, some
of the, a, it was

294
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:21.730
at MX ML. They call
us, you know, we're pushing

295
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.940
around angle brackets that aren't
the traditional HTML that we've

296
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.790
ordinarily seen. And we spoke
to the gentleman at lunch,

297
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:29.590
we talked to Scott Guthrie and
they said, well, you know,

298
00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:31.840
HTML has its place. It's
going to be around for

299
00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:34.360
a long time, but I've
always felt that the kind

300
00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:39.190
of strange relationship between HTML,
Dom CSS and JavaScript has

301
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.200
been almost a house of
cards that we're building these

302
00:16:41.200 --> 00:16:46.390
applications on and is Gmail
utterly brilliant or utterly sick

303
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.630
and twisted in that it
works, but God help us.

304
00:16:49.630 --> 00:16:52.390
What happened underneath, right? You
know, what price their soul?

305
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:56.590
Well, it's human ingenuity. It's
people figuring out with limited

306
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.320
tools how they can still
make compelling things. And I

307
00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:02.800
think it's fascinating to watch
people figure out a way

308
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:05.830
to do it no matter
what Is it right though,

309
00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.770
is the word is mashups
building the entire web on

310
00:17:08.770 --> 00:17:13.690
the house of cards? I
think what it's done is

311
00:17:13.690 --> 00:17:21.070
it's opened up a world
of imagination that could never

312
00:17:21.070 --> 00:17:24.850
have been harnessed. Had people
not have, have to figure

313
00:17:24.850 --> 00:17:29.080
out how to work around.
I mean, sometimes scarcity is

314
00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:31.930
the mother of invention and
that's certainly what we've seen

315
00:17:32.110 --> 00:17:35.510
happen on the web. So
I don't know. I think

316
00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:40.210
if we only had one
wrapper, one framework, one way

317
00:17:40.210 --> 00:17:42.010
of doing things that it
would, it wouldn't be as

318
00:17:42.010 --> 00:17:44.800
exciting as it is today.
You have such a positive

319
00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:47.800
and pragmatic attitude, I suppose.
It's one that comes over,

320
00:17:48.130 --> 00:17:50.370
you watching the entire history,
right. And when did you

321
00:17:50.370 --> 00:17:53.600
get into this? How Well
I got into computers in

322
00:17:53.750 --> 00:17:58.580
1982. So I guess I
got my first computer in

323
00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:02.210
1980 actually. So I've really
watched a lot change. I

324
00:18:02.210 --> 00:18:06.320
mean, from CPM and, you
know, command line, everything and

325
00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:09.980
serve and genie. And no,
I wasn't, I actually first

326
00:18:09.980 --> 00:18:15.320
connected experience AppleTalk strangely enough,
because I was invited into

327
00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:20.390
the Apple solutions network when
I was very early on

328
00:18:20.390 --> 00:18:24.110
in my early Mac days,
probably 1985 or 1986. Cause

329
00:18:24.110 --> 00:18:26.690
I don't have a computer
background. I, you know, I

330
00:18:26.690 --> 00:18:29.000
got into the film industry
and into design and into

331
00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.470
animation and discovered the really
got excited about the Macintosh

332
00:18:33.470 --> 00:18:37.190
in 1984. I'd been using
computers. I think I started

333
00:18:37.190 --> 00:18:41.030
got my first computer in
1980. So I got very

334
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.550
excited by the Mac that
that really kind of rocked

335
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:47.330
my world. And because it
was so approachable and I

336
00:18:47.330 --> 00:18:50.000
wasn't interested in the computer
science part of it or

337
00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:52.580
the programming part of it,
I was more interested in

338
00:18:52.580 --> 00:18:58.140
design and animation and filmmaking
and editing and photography and

339
00:18:58.350 --> 00:19:01.910
all the visual design. So
this is, this might be

340
00:19:01.910 --> 00:19:03.710
a silly question, but it
just popped into my head.

341
00:19:03.950 --> 00:19:07.610
So juxtapose the tools that
you used to do, the

342
00:19:07.610 --> 00:19:09.500
kinds of work you did
on return to the Jedi,

343
00:19:10.100 --> 00:19:17.150
which was done in 83,
83 and 83. So that

344
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:23.210
would have been 14 years
ago, 24 years ago. Okay.

345
00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:25.250
So 24 years ago you
did something. There was some

346
00:19:25.250 --> 00:19:28.400
serious animation going on in
that, you know, there was

347
00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.300
a lot of puppets and
stuff, but tools. So what

348
00:19:31.310 --> 00:19:34.460
were those tools like versus
what we saw real time

349
00:19:34.490 --> 00:19:38.360
in the browser, lightweight video
editing tool in 50 K.

350
00:19:38.390 --> 00:19:42.740
Yeah. I mean, it's, it's,
it's parallel. You still do

351
00:19:42.740 --> 00:19:45.680
the same things. I mean,
it's really interesting that a

352
00:19:45.680 --> 00:19:48.980
lot of the same principles
of design have never changed.

353
00:19:48.980 --> 00:19:52.250
I mean the principles of
good editing, good design, good

354
00:19:52.250 --> 00:19:57.710
graphics, good color choices, good
con composition, those things never

355
00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.080
changed. But you know, I
used to draw with a,

356
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.210
repeat, a graph and a
pen and ink and use

357
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:04.100
an airbrush and have to
wear a mask and have

358
00:20:04.100 --> 00:20:06.020
like black boogers in my
nose. And, you know, I

359
00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:08.780
mean, it was very visceral
like you did, you do

360
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:12.470
all the same things now
using Bezier curves and nodes

361
00:20:12.470 --> 00:20:15.200
and mass and alpha channels
and things like that. You

362
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.960
know, so it's, you're doing
exactly the same thing. You're

363
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:20.810
just using a different kind
of tool to do it

364
00:20:20.810 --> 00:20:24.170
with that's much more instantaneous.
I think that's really been

365
00:20:24.170 --> 00:20:26.660
the big shift. That's one
of the things that computers

366
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.810
have brought to the world
is, you know, instant access

367
00:20:29.810 --> 00:20:32.780
to an instant results to
things that used to take

368
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.630
a lot longer. So it
sounds like your work at

369
00:20:35.630 --> 00:20:38.510
the, the art was art
center, college of design. I

370
00:20:38.510 --> 00:20:40.880
was a teacher there it's
serving you better than, than

371
00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:44.930
my computer science degree, which
has now completely obsolete, I

372
00:20:44.930 --> 00:20:47.000
suppose. I suppose that could
be true. I mean, I'm,

373
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:50.970
there are principles of programming
aren't there And the basics

374
00:20:50.970 --> 00:20:54.120
are always the basics. I
mean, virtual machines, garbage collection,

375
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.220
we saw it 40 years
ago and we're seeing it

376
00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:58.710
today, right? So you're right.
We all come back to

377
00:20:58.710 --> 00:21:02.730
the basics, But, and I
love actually teaching tools. You

378
00:21:02.730 --> 00:21:05.880
know, we hear a lot
cause we, our library is

379
00:21:05.880 --> 00:21:09.660
used in many colleges and
what the teachers love about

380
00:21:09.660 --> 00:21:11.220
it is they don't have
to keep up with the

381
00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.370
latest version of everything and
they can stick to teaching

382
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:16.620
the principles with their students
or working on a real

383
00:21:16.620 --> 00:21:19.620
project rather than having to
learn, you know, the next

384
00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:22.200
version of flash, the next
version of this or that.

385
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:25.050
And I think there is
a lot to be said

386
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:29.250
for the computer in that,
you know, people kind of

387
00:21:29.250 --> 00:21:31.590
get into everything a little
bit differently than they used

388
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.510
to, and that it used
to be that you had

389
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:36.270
to learn the principles before
you would ever practice certain

390
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:39.270
crafts. And now you have,
I mean, I just loved

391
00:21:39.270 --> 00:21:42.600
the Cole bearer, you know,
green-screen challenge that just way,

392
00:21:43.410 --> 00:21:46.230
What you're referring to is
Steven Colbert, who is on

393
00:21:46.230 --> 00:21:48.390
the cupbearer rapport, which is
after the daily show on

394
00:21:48.390 --> 00:21:52.350
comedy central here in the
U S basically stood in

395
00:21:52.350 --> 00:21:55.380
front of a green screen
and dance around for the

396
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:57.030
better part of a few
minutes and said, here, I

397
00:21:57.030 --> 00:22:00.180
challenge you to make a
remix, Right. And on and

398
00:22:00.180 --> 00:22:03.240
on YouTube, all of these
people were doing green-screen compositing

399
00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.750
and adding three D animation.
And I mean, just, I

400
00:22:06.750 --> 00:22:09.120
don't know how many tens
of thousands of submissions there

401
00:22:09.120 --> 00:22:11.640
were about to me that
was just startling. That was

402
00:22:11.640 --> 00:22:15.930
a craft that, you know,
very few people practiced back,

403
00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.270
you know, starting with like,
let's say Ray Harryhausen and

404
00:22:18.270 --> 00:22:21.780
you know, the beginning of
animation and special effects. And

405
00:22:21.780 --> 00:22:24.270
even when I was into
it, it was a small,

406
00:22:24.270 --> 00:22:26.990
small industry. And now the
fact that anybody with a

407
00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:30.720
video camera and a piece
of software can, can play

408
00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.540
in that field, in that
sandbox. Well, some of them

409
00:22:33.540 --> 00:22:37.940
with handheld inexpensive HD video,
they're doing quality that I

410
00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.310
don't mean to speak about
return of the Jedi, but

411
00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:44.310
certainly approaches the complexity of
the kinds of animations that

412
00:22:44.310 --> 00:22:46.470
are going on. The kinds
of compositing, the kinds of

413
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:48.450
things, some of these, you've
seen some of these fans,

414
00:22:48.450 --> 00:22:51.420
star Wars things. They're unbelievable.
They're done on a portable

415
00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:55.090
company. I know. And I
think, you know, I, I

416
00:22:55.120 --> 00:22:59.610
never realized that humanity had
it in, in, in them,

417
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:01.440
you know, in itself, or
I don't know how quite

418
00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.990
to phrase that, but I
had never realized that there

419
00:23:03.990 --> 00:23:09.840
were so many frustrated storytellers
and creators and not, maybe

420
00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:11.940
not frustrated, but just people
who didn't even know they

421
00:23:11.940 --> 00:23:16.020
had that, that ability to,
to, to play in that

422
00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.510
arena. And that's what I
think is so empowering about

423
00:23:18.810 --> 00:23:22.290
the computer that, you know,
we're, we're, none of us

424
00:23:22.290 --> 00:23:25.500
would have thought to have
become book writers, you know,

425
00:23:25.500 --> 00:23:27.570
but let's look at all
these people who are blogging

426
00:23:27.570 --> 00:23:30.000
and, you know, people wouldn't
have thought to get into

427
00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.680
the field of being video
editors or videographers or photographers.

428
00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:37.080
I mean, look at what
digital photography has done to

429
00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:40.590
photography is a field just
completely opened it up. Well,

430
00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:42.180
there's been a bit, there's
been a lot of garbage,

431
00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:45.590
but within that, there are
people who never learned how

432
00:23:45.590 --> 00:23:47.900
to do photography in the
classic way. I mean, in

433
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:49.610
the dark room in black
and white, like I did

434
00:23:49.610 --> 00:23:52.040
in high school, and I'm
a lousy photographer, some of

435
00:23:52.040 --> 00:23:53.990
the stuff people are doing
with digital stuff in Lightroom,

436
00:23:54.080 --> 00:23:56.550
Adobe Lightroom, which looks an
awful lot like blend and

437
00:23:56.550 --> 00:23:58.260
that the new design tools
seem to have a common,

438
00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:02.650
common thread with their pallets
Yeah. Black background. I can

439
00:24:02.650 --> 00:24:06.220
moody in there in their
pallets. It sounds like you're

440
00:24:06.220 --> 00:24:09.070
saying that everyone had a
voice before they just didn't

441
00:24:09.070 --> 00:24:12.190
have the tools to express
themselves. Yeah. So are you

442
00:24:12.190 --> 00:24:14.140
going to start playing with
Silverlight immediately or have you

443
00:24:14.140 --> 00:24:17.500
already deep into it? You
know, I haven't had time,

444
00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:20.560
but I'm certainly inspired after
this event. I definitely can't

445
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:23.590
wait to tear it open
and dig in who has

446
00:24:23.590 --> 00:24:26.290
time at this conference. Right.
We'll be lucky if we

447
00:24:26.290 --> 00:24:29.020
get to sleep Well, thank
you very much for taking

448
00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.700
the time to talk to
us and people can check

449
00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:36.280
you out@lynda.com. And then what
is your podcast? And I

450
00:24:36.280 --> 00:24:39.340
also run the Flashforward conference,
which is the largest flash

451
00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:41.740
conference in the world it's
been going for seven years.

452
00:24:41.740 --> 00:24:45.400
So my, the podcasts that
I have personally conducted are

453
00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:50.260
at flash-forward conference.com and on
iTunes. And we also have

454
00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:55.000
a lynda.com podcast on iTunes
and atlanta.com. All right, fantastic.

455
00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.530
Well, I really appreciate you
taking the time out of

456
00:24:56.530 --> 00:24:58.270
your day and I'll see
you around the conference. I

457
00:24:58.270 --> 00:24:59.440
hope so. Thanks.
