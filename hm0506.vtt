Scott talks with enterprise developer,
turn tech CEO, Tiffany Michael, about

11
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:06.540
the challenges and rewards of
software development in a startup.

12
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.500
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

13
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.640
Hanselminutes today. I'm chatting with
Tiffany Michael. She's a CEO of

14
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:23.580
bsm.co and you're building an
online system for conferences education.

15
00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:28.160
Absolutely. So the short tagline
right now for bsm.co is

16
00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:33.710
we build customizable social broadcast
spaces and where our focus

17
00:01:33.740 --> 00:01:35.780
currently is on education, but
there are a lot of

18
00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.930
other use cases and markets
that we're looking towards exploring.

19
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:41.540
And you did some, some
virtual conferences that got a

20
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:44.360
lot of great, got a
lot of great press that

21
00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.670
allowed people to basically attend
and be present and be

22
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.810
social without having to get
on a plane. Absolutely, absolutely.

23
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:55.400
So we, we did our
held our first virtual conference

24
00:01:55.970 --> 00:02:01.850
early 2015. We, it started
because we were doing a

25
00:02:01.850 --> 00:02:06.410
series of virtual courses for
entrepreneurs and technologists of color.

26
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.250
We appreciated the virtual or
remote remote learning landscape, and

27
00:02:13.250 --> 00:02:16.160
we felt like we could
add to that as technologists

28
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:20.390
and creators. And so we
started very simple using Google

29
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.480
Hangouts and we realized really
quickly the limitations of Google

30
00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.710
Hangouts as it relates to
creating a engaging learning environment.

31
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.680
And so we started kind
of looking at other tools

32
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:33.200
we thought at the time
that we would be in

33
00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.050
the content creation space. And
so not the technology software

34
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.690
development space at all. And
so we started evaluating other

35
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:46.220
tools. A lot of the
tools were, were built on

36
00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:49.460
top of the Google hangout
infrastructure. We, there were a

37
00:02:49.460 --> 00:02:54.290
lot of other tools that
required, you know, downloads of

38
00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:58.010
softwares, just Adobe connect system
and nothing that really worked

39
00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:01.810
for us. And so we
used CMS and JavaScript and

40
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:05.950
hack something together, hack together
a virtual conference center, and

41
00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.420
we thought it would be
a onetime thing, but speakers

42
00:03:10.420 --> 00:03:13.780
and attendees of the conference
were in all and really

43
00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:16.360
blown away by how engaging
it was, how much fun

44
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:19.750
they had on the platform
that they were able to

45
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.150
communicate with both the speakers
in real time and other

46
00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:24.850
attendees. And that was kind
of our biggest moment of

47
00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.820
validation as a startup. When
we really started to realize

48
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:31.660
that we had finally built
something that people wanted to

49
00:03:31.660 --> 00:03:34.750
pay for. And so we've
been exploring how to build

50
00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:38.670
a virtual learning tools for
the last year. Very cool.

51
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:40.320
One of the things that
I liked the most about

52
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.390
it when I was attending
one of the conferences virtually

53
00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.330
is that you effectively captured
what we call the, the

54
00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:48.900
hallway track, right? I mean,
we all go to conferences

55
00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:50.640
and sometimes we just skip
a talk and we just

56
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:52.560
want to hang out with
people that there was a

57
00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:54.780
sense of we're all in
this together, as opposed to

58
00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:57.840
the I'm watching a static
stream, I'm just watching a

59
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:01.890
stream. Absolutely. And one of
the things, as we begin

60
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.740
to build out the software
and think about how we

61
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:09.000
are unique and different from
others who similar players in

62
00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.490
the space, we feel like
we're the, we're one of

63
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:16.200
the few people in the
remote learning space who really

64
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:19.290
care about the overall experience
of the learner. It's not

65
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:22.560
really about just converting them
into, to buy something, but

66
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:26.040
really are they speaking with
other people? Are they having

67
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:29.640
positive interactions with other people
who are watching and using

68
00:04:29.640 --> 00:04:33.030
technology to enable those, those
experiences? Right. That makes me

69
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:36.090
feel like the difference between
selling technology versus really selling

70
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:39.450
an experience and technology is
in this case. Secondary. Absolutely.

71
00:04:39.930 --> 00:04:43.230
So what I think is
interesting about your, your story

72
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:45.390
and why I wanted to
talk to you is there's

73
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:46.710
a couple of things that
you're doing that I can

74
00:04:46.710 --> 00:04:51.630
totally relate to first, you
were an enterprise software developer.

75
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:53.130
So I mean, how big
was the company you worked

76
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:55.530
at before? Sure. So I
was at Accenture for five

77
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:59.040
years. And so some of
the clients I had at

78
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:04.110
my last client was Pepsi-Co
huge company. Everybody knows who

79
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:07.380
Pepsi is. I did a
lot of big government projects.

80
00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:12.780
So a big Oracle implementation
for the air force did

81
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.440
a big custom application for
Illinois unemployment office. So really

82
00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:23.580
big, huge projects. And now
how many developers do you

83
00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.250
have helped you? One, we
have it's myself and one

84
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.990
other developer That has got
to be like a huge

85
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.720
change. It's got to be
a culture shock, even It

86
00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:39.120
is, it is it's scary
and intimidating and exciting. And

87
00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:42.000
I am like, Oh my
God, I cannot believe that

88
00:05:42.030 --> 00:05:46.500
I have all this responsibility.
And so it's, it's been

89
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:51.510
exciting, but it's definitely, I
wish there were more public

90
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:55.770
conversations about what it's like
to go from. I'm a

91
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:59.240
developer on a team, 50
or a hundred other developers

92
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.200
who all have specializations in
different areas too. It's two

93
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.350
of us responsible for delivering
a production level app that

94
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:10.580
doesn't crash. So yeah, it's,
it's, it's, it's tough. Yeah.

95
00:06:10.840 --> 00:06:13.420
Yeah. Maybe the conversation can
be facilitated on your platform.

96
00:06:13.420 --> 00:06:16.300
Cause I think that the
people who are listening are

97
00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.510
these enterprise offer developers. There's
a term that I coined

98
00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:22.120
a couple of years ago
that some people totally resonated

99
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:25.420
with and other ones don't
like called dark matter developers.

100
00:06:25.540 --> 00:06:28.420
And those are the space
between the stars, right? For

101
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:31.210
every one developer who's out
there speaking at a conference,

102
00:06:31.570 --> 00:06:33.730
there's a thousand of us
that are just doing our

103
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.910
jobs and going to work
and building insurance software and

104
00:06:37.540 --> 00:06:41.560
text boxes over data. Where
are the resources for us

105
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:47.110
to make startups? Absolutely. Yeah.
It's, it's tough. And especially

106
00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:52.740
because entrepreneurial has gotten so
hot and for, you know,

107
00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:57.580
because tech, entrepreneurship has been
so hot, there's often people

108
00:06:57.580 --> 00:07:00.640
want to tie learning the
code with starting a business.

109
00:07:02.020 --> 00:07:06.810
And while those things are
somewhat related, there's a whole

110
00:07:06.990 --> 00:07:09.640
wide area of space that
comes from, I know how

111
00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:13.750
to write a program to
I'm prepared to build something

112
00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:16.030
that other people will buy
and take the scale. And,

113
00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:20.950
and so, yeah, I'd love
to see more conversation about

114
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:24.280
like, you know, one of
the things that I, one

115
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.380
of the big first decisions
I had to make was

116
00:07:26.410 --> 00:07:31.360
what were we going to
build in? And because I

117
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.340
had, so I was a
consultant for many years, which

118
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.700
means I was hired as
a Java developer. I built

119
00:07:36.730 --> 00:07:39.760
maybe two custom apps and
really, it was just kind

120
00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.190
of whatever my client needed.
And so I didn't get

121
00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.560
an opportunity to specialize this
lab played with C-sharp a

122
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.680
little bit, actually, that, that
is what I VB is

123
00:07:47.680 --> 00:07:53.350
what I learned to program
in, in 2006, but I

124
00:07:53.350 --> 00:07:56.230
hadn't been, you know, all
over the place. And so

125
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:58.120
it was finally time for
me to like pick a

126
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.190
stack and I'm like, I
don't know, what is it

127
00:08:00.190 --> 00:08:02.500
going to be? And so,
because I had, you know,

128
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:06.940
I appreciated the.net framework and
I had a lot of

129
00:08:06.940 --> 00:08:09.460
experience, recent experiences with C
sharp. I'm like, okay, we're

130
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.220
going to go over that
net C-sharp route. And I

131
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:16.960
started to hire, try to
hire C sharp developers, which

132
00:08:16.960 --> 00:08:19.180
was cool. But what I
realized is that what I

133
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:22.990
quickly realized is that rather
than hiring for a specific

134
00:08:23.230 --> 00:08:27.850
technology that early I needed
to hire for passion in

135
00:08:27.850 --> 00:08:32.560
the product and passionate in
what we were building. And

136
00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:34.300
it just so happened that
I found someone who was

137
00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:40.570
super passionate about remote learning,
the web RTC web real

138
00:08:40.570 --> 00:08:44.530
time communication library, and toolkit.
And they were a Java

139
00:08:44.530 --> 00:08:48.010
developer. And so it just
so happened that we decided

140
00:08:48.010 --> 00:08:52.510
to go the Java group
beat groovy grills route because

141
00:08:52.510 --> 00:08:57.720
this person was so passionate
about the product and we

142
00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:00.020
were able to grow with
them. So do you think

143
00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:04.430
that people over stressed the
need for the technology stack?

144
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.200
Like, you know, you get
people, you get into these

145
00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:08.300
religious arguments, there's a lot
of zealotry where people are

146
00:09:08.300 --> 00:09:10.700
like, Oh, you picked, someone
might be listening right now.

147
00:09:10.730 --> 00:09:12.590
Oh, you pick groovy on
grails out. It's crap. You

148
00:09:12.590 --> 00:09:15.020
gotta pick this other thing.
Right. You can't be, you

149
00:09:15.020 --> 00:09:18.800
can't be successful now. Yeah,
absolutely. And I mean, I

150
00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:21.410
think there are, you know,
some, you know, foundational decisions

151
00:09:21.410 --> 00:09:23.330
that you have to make
that will have implications for

152
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:24.830
the next year and two
years. But I feel like

153
00:09:24.830 --> 00:09:27.110
when you're in a startup,
it's really just about like

154
00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:32.930
that minimum viable product, like,
and how quickly can you

155
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.750
move with that MVP? And
so even if you have

156
00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:38.780
like the expert in some
stack, if they're not passionate

157
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.260
about like moving and moving
fast, you'll go nowhere. And

158
00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.110
I think that we're still
in a place where eventually

159
00:09:45.110 --> 00:09:48.200
we'll be able to like,
make some changes when we

160
00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.330
have more customers and funding.
And we know for sure

161
00:09:50.330 --> 00:09:52.850
what we're building, cause right
now we're still kind of

162
00:09:52.850 --> 00:09:54.860
figuring it out. So not
only did you have to

163
00:09:54.860 --> 00:09:56.900
pick a technology stack, but
you also have to pick

164
00:09:57.020 --> 00:10:01.160
a workflow, right. Did you
go agile or scrum or

165
00:10:01.580 --> 00:10:03.610
waterfall or, you know, I
mean all these things and

166
00:10:03.610 --> 00:10:05.630
not to mention source control.
And a lot of times

167
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:08.300
I found I was an
enterprise developer for seven years

168
00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:12.350
and I would find myself
slipping into comfortable technologies, but

169
00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.140
maybe they weren't the right
technology All the time. It's

170
00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:20.450
something I think about all
the time. Yes. Yes. So

171
00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:28.310
we use Bitbucket as our
repo. He was good or

172
00:10:28.310 --> 00:10:34.610
SVN. Okay. And we, I
I'd say we kind of

173
00:10:34.610 --> 00:10:39.200
have an agile workflow, but
again, it's, so right now

174
00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.310
it's two of us. And
so I know we have

175
00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:48.800
some awful habits and it's
just like, okay, we've got

176
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:50.960
an event coming. Like just
like, get it done kind

177
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.380
of thing. But now that
we're like, okay, it's time

178
00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:58.220
for us to like grow
up and create an environment

179
00:10:58.220 --> 00:11:01.430
that other developers will want
to work in. I spend

180
00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:04.130
so many tasks a lot
of time in a day

181
00:11:04.130 --> 00:11:06.140
thinking about like, okay, how
do I do this the

182
00:11:06.140 --> 00:11:08.540
right way? How do I
set processes in place? Now

183
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.270
that might be a pain
kind of like over might

184
00:11:11.270 --> 00:11:14.000
feel like overkill when there's
just two people, but we'll

185
00:11:14.450 --> 00:11:18.560
save our asses when there's
like 10 of us. So

186
00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:21.110
if, if it's just you
and one other person as

187
00:11:21.110 --> 00:11:23.390
the other person, cause you're
a small, a small business,

188
00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.340
is the other person a
subcontractor or are they an

189
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.600
employee? The other person is
a subcontractor. You hire, like,

190
00:11:29.630 --> 00:11:31.400
you kind of like swell
up and have four or

191
00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:34.520
five subcontractors. And then you
come back down when, when

192
00:11:34.550 --> 00:11:37.070
at different times. Yeah. We're
figuring that out right now.

193
00:11:37.070 --> 00:11:40.550
So we had to, the
most we've ever had is

194
00:11:40.550 --> 00:11:45.110
to, to other people. And
we, so, yeah. And I

195
00:11:45.110 --> 00:11:47.900
guess going back to agile,
I have been like breaking

196
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:51.740
up our project into short
sprints. And so I will

197
00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.370
kind of determine how, how
many resources I need for

198
00:11:54.370 --> 00:11:57.610
each sprint. And there was
one sprint where we had

199
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:01.180
three people total. They were
also contractors right now. It's

200
00:12:01.180 --> 00:12:04.950
just me and another person.
No, your Bo your, your

201
00:12:04.950 --> 00:12:08.550
partner is dr. Courtney Ziegler,
who I had on the

202
00:12:08.550 --> 00:12:11.280
show a I think a
year or two ago. And

203
00:12:11.490 --> 00:12:14.220
so you are the CEO,
he acts as the COO.

204
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:17.520
Correct. And you know, he's
got vision and passion and

205
00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.520
a filmmaking background and a
promotional background. So he's thinking

206
00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:22.860
about how to get, you
know, get, raise money and

207
00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:25.680
things like that. But I've
always found when you have

208
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:28.020
a, and I'll just use
the, kind of the Wazniak

209
00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:30.360
and the Steve jobs analogy,
or the bill Gates and

210
00:12:30.360 --> 00:12:33.570
the Steve Balmer kind of
partners. You're going to be

211
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:37.860
diff you know, two sides
of the same coin. Do

212
00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:41.760
you have architectural discussions with
him? Does he do want

213
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.080
to get involved in the
technical arguments? Yes, absolutely. So

214
00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:47.820
I think in the beginning
he was a little shy

215
00:12:47.820 --> 00:12:49.680
about it. Like, Oh my
goodness, I've never built software

216
00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:51.270
before. I don't know if
I should even be a

217
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.730
part of these conversations. I
don't know if I can

218
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:55.620
add value. And I was
like, yes, you are really,

219
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.410
really important to these conversations.
Because what I found is

220
00:12:58.410 --> 00:13:02.880
when just developers in the
room, the conversation can go

221
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:04.980
different ways. The conversation can
go, okay, what's the easiest

222
00:13:04.980 --> 00:13:07.770
way to do this. What's
the technology that I actually

223
00:13:07.770 --> 00:13:10.290
want to use. What do
I care about as a

224
00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:13.920
developer versus what do the
customer, what do our users

225
00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:17.820
actually want to see? And
so Courtney has absolutely always

226
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:21.540
brings the voice of our
users and he has a

227
00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.870
design background. And so it's
always wants things to be

228
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:30.180
really elegant, really easy to
use and intuitive. I think

229
00:13:30.180 --> 00:13:34.170
what developers define as intuitive
is sometimes different than what

230
00:13:34.170 --> 00:13:37.050
everybody else defines us intuitive.
So I really appreciate having

231
00:13:37.050 --> 00:13:40.080
him in the conversations as
well. W when you have

232
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:44.070
a somewhat nontechnical cofounder, though,
do you get into situations

233
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:46.380
where, Hey, the requirement was
just a sentence, like I

234
00:13:46.380 --> 00:13:49.250
gave you the business requirement.
Why is this 10,000 lines?

235
00:13:50.280 --> 00:13:54.450
Yes, absolutely. And there are
times when I think Courtney

236
00:13:54.450 --> 00:13:56.190
asks me, well, can't we
just do this? And I'm

237
00:13:56.190 --> 00:13:58.410
like, okay. So first of
all, we have to talk

238
00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.020
a little bit more granular
level about, can it just

239
00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:03.000
do this? Like, okay, we
have to talk like, you

240
00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.640
know, you have to, has
to be really detailed about

241
00:14:05.640 --> 00:14:09.730
like everything. So he's, he's
learning like how detailed we

242
00:14:09.730 --> 00:14:12.690
we've started to like write
user stories together and he's

243
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.710
learning how detailed they need
to be so that we

244
00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:22.650
prevent any back and forth
that happens. Hey folks, I

245
00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:25.440
wanted to take a moment
to tell you about Reagan

246
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:28.350
and their new product called
pulse Reagan as an error

247
00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:32.010
and crash reporting software provider
and their new product pulse.

248
00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:35.610
It's a realtime user monitoring
product. It gives you performance

249
00:14:35.610 --> 00:14:39.390
data and user insights. Lets
you understand exactly what's happening

250
00:14:39.630 --> 00:14:42.150
when users interact with your
software. So you're never left

251
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.660
guessing. Reagan provides you with
the answers to your performance

252
00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.320
questions and they've found over
10 billion that's billion with a

253
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.630
B bugs and apps with
their crash reporting product. And

254
00:14:53.630 --> 00:14:56.960
now Reagan will help you
understand application quality. Like no

255
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:01.010
one else over 30,000 developers
worldwide, can't be wrong. I

256
00:15:01.010 --> 00:15:02.840
use Reagan and all the
time and I enjoy it

257
00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:05.270
very much. You can try
it out today with a

258

259
00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:18.280
quality immediately try Reagan for
free today@reagan.io. Yeah. Sometimes I

260
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:22.240
think that non technical cofounders
or not as technical, co-founders

261
00:15:23.500 --> 00:15:26.170
kind of forget that there's
this there's this table that

262
00:15:26.170 --> 00:15:28.270
we, the developers have in
our minds about like all

263
00:15:28.270 --> 00:15:30.400
the browsers and all the
platforms. And they might say

264
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:33.310
something a little throwaway sentence.
And then in your mind

265
00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:36.490
you're like, Oh, but what
about Safari on old Macs?

266
00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:39.550
You know, do we care
about those people? And then

267
00:15:39.550 --> 00:15:44.920
it becomes Yep. Snowball. Yep.
So you are a small

268
00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:48.010
team, but you're going to
grow. You've you've taken some

269
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:52.150
investment at this point. You're
making architectural decisions. You're making

270
00:15:52.150 --> 00:15:55.210
technical decisions, but I'm assuming
also you don't want to

271
00:15:55.210 --> 00:15:57.340
build all this stuff yourself.
Like if there's a great

272
00:15:57.700 --> 00:16:00.670
technology you're using it. So
you mentioned web RTC. Yes.

273
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.880
Is that something that you
will pick over, you know,

274
00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:07.960
just YouTube and, and something
like that? Yes. So when

275
00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:10.930
we, as I mentioned, when
we started, we were using

276
00:16:10.930 --> 00:16:15.010
the Google Hangouts infrastructure and
we knew that in order

277
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.590
for us to build something
sustainable, we had to find

278
00:16:17.590 --> 00:16:20.200
a way to move off
of the Google Hangouts infrastructure.

279
00:16:21.670 --> 00:16:23.230
Okay. In the sense that
you don't want to build

280
00:16:23.230 --> 00:16:27.400
a business that is entirely
dependent on Hangouts, correct? Yep.

281
00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:33.010
And so, yeah. And so
a web RTC is a

282
00:16:33.010 --> 00:16:39.970
library sort of library framework
that allows in browser real

283
00:16:39.970 --> 00:16:46.180
time communication, there's open source
versions of it. And then

284
00:16:46.720 --> 00:16:50.080
a lot of folks who
offer their own special API

285
00:16:51.790 --> 00:16:55.480
and yeah. Plugin. Right. That's
cause you mentioned before that

286
00:16:55.690 --> 00:16:57.670
having to download stuff was
going to be a problem

287
00:16:57.670 --> 00:17:00.790
for your attendees, Correct? Yeah.
And so one of the

288
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:03.730
things that's a big, huge
value for us is accessibility

289
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:08.350
and inclusion, which includes like
device type and bandwidth and

290
00:17:08.350 --> 00:17:11.920
all of that. And so
yeah, if we felt like

291
00:17:11.950 --> 00:17:18.280
to create an inclusive tool,
we needed something that was

292
00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.940
a hundred percent in browser
and the web RTC libraries

293
00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:26.050
allows that. So that means
then modern browsers, you know,

294
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:29.530
somewhat modern, right. The last
couple of years and you

295
00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:34.420
know, reasonably modern, portable devices
and things like that. But

296
00:17:34.420 --> 00:17:36.460
for the general, for the
general person who wants to

297
00:17:36.460 --> 00:17:38.770
show up, they just, they
roll in, they've got Chrome,

298
00:17:38.770 --> 00:17:41.560
they've got Firefox, they've got
edge or a new tablet

299
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.600
and there's no, there's no
download there's no anything like

300
00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:46.570
that. Yep. Do you, how
many open source libraries have

301
00:17:46.570 --> 00:17:48.670
you brought in, like, do
you do, do you off

302
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:50.310
the top of head, is
there a particular library that

303
00:17:50.310 --> 00:17:54.300
stands out and you're like,
Oh, without food dot, JS,

304
00:17:54.630 --> 00:18:00.560
this project would have been
more different. Yeah. So we

305
00:18:00.560 --> 00:18:07.700
use open talk, which is
API library for web RTC.

306
00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.830
And that's been really huge
for us. I think there

307
00:18:09.830 --> 00:18:12.380
are others libraries. So one
of the things that we're

308
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:18.380
really interested in right now
is using Twitter as an

309
00:18:18.380 --> 00:18:25.940
engagement tool. And so we've
been playing with different Twitter

310
00:18:26.930 --> 00:18:31.520
libraries In order to abstract
away the complexities of Twitter

311
00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:34.190
itself. Yep. Yep. So you
said just to, for folks

312
00:18:34.190 --> 00:18:36.920
that are listening since this
is a podcast open talk

313
00:18:36.920 --> 00:18:40.040
is open T O K,
correct? Not a T a

314
00:18:40.070 --> 00:18:43.130
T a L K. Yep.
And this is a, a

315
00:18:43.130 --> 00:18:44.660
library that sits on top,
but it's, it's also a

316
00:18:44.660 --> 00:18:46.910
series of services. It sits
on top of web RTC,

317
00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:49.700
but this puts you in
control. I think what's significant

318
00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:52.910
about this is that you
could have built this on

319
00:18:52.940 --> 00:18:55.640
Hangouts and you know, like
I do a week, I

320
00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.210
do a weekly, a community
standup and you know, we're

321
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:02.270
not a company, we're just
doing this for work and

322
00:19:02.270 --> 00:19:05.630
we've hidden it all with
JavaScript. And it's, it's, it's,

323
00:19:05.630 --> 00:19:09.680
you know, it's Google Hangouts
and it's embedded YouTube, but

324
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:12.290
you know, my YouTube channel
could get deleted. You know,

325
00:19:12.300 --> 00:19:15.200
I'm going to lose all
that intellectual property. We actually

326
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.210
had an issue like that
with one of our conferences.

327
00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:22.300
It was awful. Yeah. So
we, you know, again, we're

328
00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:24.680
all about kind of the
experience of the user. And

329
00:19:25.310 --> 00:19:28.040
we decided that in between
sessions, we should have music.

330
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:32.420
We didn't, we, we played
like it was copy-written music

331
00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:36.470
and YouTube took down all
five hours of our conference.

332
00:19:37.100 --> 00:19:41.060
Did you like, get it
back? We were able to

333
00:19:41.090 --> 00:19:43.460
hack together. I mean, it
took us several hours of

334
00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:47.780
work to recover it, but
that was a lesson learned.

335
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:49.520
And we were like, okay,
then we have to get

336
00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:52.160
off of Google Hangouts, but
right. And that is such

337
00:19:52.160 --> 00:19:54.650
a challenge for startups because
you want to sit on

338
00:19:54.650 --> 00:19:56.870
a mature platform and use
some software as a service.

339
00:19:57.350 --> 00:20:01.370
But if you don't control
your bytes, then you get,

340
00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.570
you get nailed. Yep. So
you're building more stuff yourself.

341
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:07.730
You're building it on. You
said groovy on grails. Where

342
00:20:07.730 --> 00:20:09.800
do you do your hosting?
Are you hosting yourself? You're

343
00:20:09.800 --> 00:20:12.220
going into Amazon or Azure.
Yeah. So we're, we're, we're

344
00:20:12.290 --> 00:20:16.880
having a Heroku AWS fight
right now. What does it

345
00:20:16.890 --> 00:20:23.060
mean? Well, her Roca was
cheaper, but it crashes. So

346
00:20:23.510 --> 00:20:25.910
we're just, we're just, we're,
we're playing with different configuration

347
00:20:25.910 --> 00:20:28.370
on both Heroku and AWS
to figure out what we

348
00:20:28.370 --> 00:20:30.950
can do for the cheapest
we actually, we have. Okay.

349
00:20:30.990 --> 00:20:33.470
Shout out to you for
helping us get in BizSpark.

350
00:20:35.540 --> 00:20:38.960
The hosting on Azure for
our video has been huge.

351
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.900
Oh. So you're using the
media stuff on Azure. Yep.

352
00:20:42.380 --> 00:20:44.420
Interesting. So I think what's
significant about this and I

353
00:20:44.430 --> 00:20:47.560
appreciate that. I'm not trying
to sell Azure, but I

354
00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.380
think what's interesting is that
even with two people in

355
00:20:50.380 --> 00:20:54.370
a small business, you're a
multi-cloud company and that I'm

356
00:20:54.370 --> 00:20:57.280
hearing that more and more
people aren't going all in

357
00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:59.410
on one cloud because you
might need to move at

358
00:20:59.410 --> 00:21:02.710
any time. Yes, absolutely. Was
that a, was that an

359
00:21:02.710 --> 00:21:07.410
obvious decision or did that
just happen? I think initially

360
00:21:07.410 --> 00:21:09.480
we were, we were kind
of like a, what do

361
00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:13.170
we have familiarity with as
individuals? And then what's the

362
00:21:13.170 --> 00:21:18.210
cheapest. Yeah. If you can
get free, free, free credits

363
00:21:18.210 --> 00:21:20.120
or whatever, I'm sure all
of the clouds have a,

364
00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:25.530
a startup feature has, has
licensing of things been difficult

365
00:21:25.530 --> 00:21:27.780
at all. I know that
small, small companies, when they

366
00:21:27.810 --> 00:21:29.790
start bringing in open source
libraries, they'll say, Oh, well

367
00:21:29.790 --> 00:21:32.920
this is GPL or, Oh,
this is a patchy. I

368
00:21:33.030 --> 00:21:34.380
want to use this. I
don't want to use that.

369
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.260
Yeah. We haven't at all.
It may be something that

370
00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:39.180
we run into, but that
hasn't been an issue thus

371
00:21:39.180 --> 00:21:43.170
far. And what about security
as an enterprise developer? I

372
00:21:43.170 --> 00:21:45.600
remember that I had a
whole security team, so I

373
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.000
thought about it, but I
didn't think about it. Well,

374
00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:53.280
so as of this past
month, Chrome, no longer allows

375
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.260
web RTC streams unless you
have an SSL certificate. And

376
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.600
so that was some new
something new. So we were

377
00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:03.510
like, okay, we were moving
into that direction to make

378
00:22:03.510 --> 00:22:05.370
sure that everything was secure
in any way. But then

379
00:22:05.370 --> 00:22:09.420
as of December we had
to. So yeah, it's, it's,

380
00:22:09.420 --> 00:22:12.060
it's definitely something that we're
still working out and thinking

381
00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.700
through. So I think that's
a really interesting thing to

382
00:22:14.700 --> 00:22:17.310
dig into a little bit.
Like someone might be listening

383
00:22:17.430 --> 00:22:19.740
and thinking, well, that's obvious
they should have an SSL

384
00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:23.910
certificate, but when you're an
enterprise software developer that's edge,

385
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:27.780
like that's handled, like someone
else registers that domain, someone

386
00:22:27.780 --> 00:22:30.240
else gets to search. You
don't think about that. Yup.

387
00:22:30.750 --> 00:22:33.090
Yeah. I mean, all of
these really think that these

388
00:22:33.090 --> 00:22:35.850
things that like, Oh, like
they're like no brainers, but

389
00:22:35.850 --> 00:22:38.070
they're like no brainers for
the people who spend all

390
00:22:38.070 --> 00:22:41.700
day thinking about them. And
not also all the other

391
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:45.180
stuff like getting customers and
making sure contractors are paid

392
00:22:45.180 --> 00:22:48.090
and that our app doesn't
crash and yeah. Well that

393
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:50.550
was my next question. So
how much time are you

394
00:22:50.550 --> 00:22:52.920
actually spending doing the technology
and the coding you love

395
00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:58.710
versus all the administrivia? Yeah.
You're shaking your Not a

396
00:22:58.710 --> 00:23:02.040
lot. Yeah. It's, it's, it's
difficult. I don't, I don't

397
00:23:02.040 --> 00:23:05.760
get to spend nearly enough
time geeking out and I'm

398
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:08.880
trying to do a better
job of like, cause one

399
00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.770
of the things that's really
makes me nervous now it

400
00:23:10.770 --> 00:23:13.440
makes me nervous for there
to be any part of

401
00:23:13.440 --> 00:23:16.770
my applications that I don't
understand. Well. Oh no, I

402
00:23:16.770 --> 00:23:19.410
know, but you know, that's
going to happen. I know.

403
00:23:19.590 --> 00:23:24.060
I know. No, I'm totally
with you. Like there's a

404
00:23:24.060 --> 00:23:28.500
moment where it's like, when
I'm raising two boys and

405
00:23:29.490 --> 00:23:31.170
I think it was maybe
in the last month or

406
00:23:31.170 --> 00:23:34.320
two where I'm like, wow,
they have whole lives and

407
00:23:34.320 --> 00:23:36.630
like friends and opinions that
I did not put in

408
00:23:36.630 --> 00:23:41.070
their brains and fully understand
them anymore. It's like your,

409
00:23:41.070 --> 00:23:43.050
you know, your program where
you don't really understand it

410
00:23:43.050 --> 00:23:46.040
works, but I don't know
how, and then it's like,

411
00:23:46.040 --> 00:23:47.870
You don't really know what
to expect and then like,

412
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:52.480
yeah. Yeah. So at some
point you either need to

413
00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:56.050
go all in and don't
be CEO be CTO. Right.

414
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.100
Right. Or you just declare
like you hear this a

415
00:24:00.100 --> 00:24:03.190
lot. Well, I used to
be technical and you know,

416
00:24:03.190 --> 00:24:06.280
but then I started a
business. I know it's yeah.

417
00:24:06.640 --> 00:24:10.570
It's something that, yeah, it
definitely is. If I had

418
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:12.430
my way, I don't know
if I should publicly say

419
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:14.620
this, but I'm willing anywhere.
I would be CTO that

420
00:24:14.770 --> 00:24:19.060
that's where I want to
be. I also know that

421
00:24:19.060 --> 00:24:28.210
as founder, the vision is
really important and I don't

422
00:24:28.210 --> 00:24:30.610
know that I am ready
to give up, give up

423
00:24:30.610 --> 00:24:32.650
that vision. We're not mature
enough yet for me to

424
00:24:32.650 --> 00:24:37.090
like, let somebody else take
the reins of that. Yeah.

425
00:24:37.090 --> 00:24:39.670
That is the challenge with
all these things. And I,

426
00:24:39.890 --> 00:24:41.620
I can also say though,
as someone who has a

427
00:24:41.620 --> 00:24:45.880
small startup, much, much smaller
that maybe we made the

428
00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:50.440
mistake of having two technical
people, you know, I've got,

429
00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.520
I've got two Wozniaks and
I have no, you know,

430
00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:56.500
having a passion person and
we just thought it would

431
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:58.690
light the world on fire
because it was amazing. You

432
00:24:58.690 --> 00:25:01.510
just build something cool. And
it's so cool, but no

433
00:25:01.510 --> 00:25:04.270
one cares. Yeah. That has
got to be a real

434
00:25:04.270 --> 00:25:06.790
challenge. Is it difficult to
divide the work? Is it

435
00:25:06.790 --> 00:25:09.760
clear what you and what
Courtney does? Are you always

436
00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:12.250
just hustling? Yeah, I think
in the beginning, in the

437
00:25:12.250 --> 00:25:15.220
very beginning months it was
difficult because we didn't really

438
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:17.470
have a real product. And
so we were like trying

439
00:25:17.470 --> 00:25:19.060
to figure out who I
read, what did we do?

440
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:22.900
What do we sell? And
so at that point it

441
00:25:22.900 --> 00:25:24.970
was kind of difficult. And
we were doing like daily

442
00:25:24.970 --> 00:25:27.880
check-ins at that point, like
daily, hourly calls of like

443
00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:31.030
working sessions to kind of
figure it out. But then

444
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:34.360
once we get a little
bit more mature and we

445
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.940
had an actual product to
sell, we were able to

446
00:25:36.940 --> 00:25:41.530
divide responsibilities. So yeah. And
at this point it's very

447
00:25:41.530 --> 00:25:45.490
clear with how to handle
things. It's clearer. I don't

448
00:25:45.490 --> 00:25:51.820
know if it's very clear.
Yeah. I mean, one of

449
00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:53.590
the things that I know
we do really, really well

450
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.430
is we're both dreamers and
visionaries and big picture people.

451
00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:03.100
And when you're running a
startup, both of the founders,

452
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:06.100
can't be, can't be, you
need somebody who's like big

453
00:26:06.130 --> 00:26:09.310
picture and somebody who's like
tactical, like we've got to

454
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.110
get stuff done. And I
think we do a good

455
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.690
job of like going back
and forth and allowing us

456
00:26:13.690 --> 00:26:17.200
both to be able to
play the dreamer. Do you

457
00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:20.260
feel like two is the
team size? Like that's the

458
00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:22.840
start? Like every startup should
have two because I've heard

459
00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:25.540
of like five pre person
startup. I've heard of one

460
00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:27.970
person trying to do it
on their own. I think

461
00:26:27.970 --> 00:26:31.780
five would be intense, although
yeah. One when Courtney and

462
00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:38.140
I met, we met, I
co-organized trans hack Chicago. So

463
00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:40.450
I was at dev bootcamp,
helped devil camp launch a

464
00:26:40.450 --> 00:26:42.820
Chicago location. That's how I
met Gordian. And we had

465
00:26:42.820 --> 00:26:45.150
an, it was what was
cool is we had an

466
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:47.430
opportunity to meet over a
hackathon weekend. So we had

467
00:26:47.430 --> 00:26:50.130
like five days to work
together and actually produce something.

468
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:51.800
And, okay. That's a really
good point. Actually. Let me

469
00:26:51.800 --> 00:26:54.770
just to interrupt you to
have a hackathon is almost

470
00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.010
an interview process or like
a first date for a

471
00:26:58.010 --> 00:27:00.710
founder is a great idea.
Yeah. So yeah, I really

472
00:27:00.710 --> 00:27:04.130
appreciate it. That I'm having
that experience. And one of

473
00:27:04.130 --> 00:27:08.140
the things we were like
late at night and we

474
00:27:08.140 --> 00:27:10.240
were talking and one of
the things that Courtney said

475
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:12.350
is like, yeah, the business
part is kind of easy.

476
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.920
It's really just the emotional
part that you need someone

477
00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.530
else there for. And that
was the moment I was

478
00:27:18.530 --> 00:27:21.800
like, Oh, maybe we should
work together. Cause we were

479
00:27:21.800 --> 00:27:24.740
really smart and shared values
and a lot of things

480
00:27:24.740 --> 00:27:28.160
that you need to work
with someone. So yeah. That's

481
00:27:28.200 --> 00:27:31.430
the point just being that,
like the emotional piece of

482
00:27:31.430 --> 00:27:34.430
having someone else to talk
to when you're right before

483
00:27:34.430 --> 00:27:36.200
you're getting ready to go
into a really big sales

484
00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.140
call or having someone else
to talk to when like

485
00:27:39.170 --> 00:27:41.630
you create something and nobody
buys it and you're like,

486
00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:46.280
feeling like crap. I don't
know. I, I know for

487
00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.050
sure that we would not,
I would not be on

488
00:27:51.050 --> 00:27:52.970
this journey if I didn't
have a partner in it,

489
00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:56.540
at least one partner in
it. Yeah. You know, I've

490
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:00.050
always been surprised when I
see amazing work done by

491
00:28:00.050 --> 00:28:03.770
single individuals and you, you
know, you go on hacker

492
00:28:03.770 --> 00:28:06.710
news and you're like, Oh,
I built a Commodore 64

493
00:28:06.710 --> 00:28:09.050
emulator in JavaScript in my
basement, all alone. You know,

494
00:28:09.290 --> 00:28:11.840
you just locked yourself in
there. Like I have to

495
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.670
walk around and talk to
people. I got to go

496
00:28:13.670 --> 00:28:15.890
to Starbucks and talk to
random strangers and say, what

497
00:28:15.890 --> 00:28:17.960
do you think about this?
When I was an enterprise

498
00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.650
developer, I was always wandering
and other people's cubes just

499
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.390
because I want to be
there. I mean, have you,

500
00:28:23.410 --> 00:28:27.350
I've always found coding as
a social experiment. Absolutely. And

501
00:28:27.350 --> 00:28:30.200
so, yeah, right now I'm,
I'm like the most isolated

502
00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:31.550
have ever been in my
life and it's kind of

503
00:28:31.550 --> 00:28:35.390
dangerous and something to talk
about just like isolation of

504
00:28:35.390 --> 00:28:39.260
startup founders. Yeah. I spent
a lot of time alone

505
00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:44.120
and it's, it's crazy. And
especially, so my cofounder lives

506
00:28:44.120 --> 00:28:49.550
2000 miles away from me.
So we're completely virtual. Yeah.

507
00:28:49.580 --> 00:28:55.190
I, I can relate. I
work remotely, like I'm here

508
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:58.010
and you know, I see,
I can see your closet.

509
00:28:58.670 --> 00:29:01.130
You can see my closet
and my couch. Right. We're

510
00:29:01.130 --> 00:29:05.150
having this discussion over Skype
and I'm kind of lonely

511
00:29:05.150 --> 00:29:07.970
right now. And I'm actually
going to drive up to

512
00:29:07.970 --> 00:29:11.000
Seattle to go and hang
out with my coworkers tomorrow

513
00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.390
because, because it's just driving
me nuts, you know, it's

514
00:29:14.390 --> 00:29:17.060
been too long. Do you
go to meetups? What do

515
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.540
you do as a technical
COVID injection? Yeah. Yeah. And

516
00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:22.310
then, so I also have
this thing that like, I'm

517
00:29:22.310 --> 00:29:26.450
a black woman, which means
that oftentimes even though I've

518
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.750
been a developer for 10
years, you know, I have

519
00:29:29.750 --> 00:29:32.570
to like prove my credibility
over and over again, which

520
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.570
gets exhausting at times. I
want to talk about like

521
00:29:35.570 --> 00:29:37.730
geek stuff. And like people
assume that I'm there to

522
00:29:37.730 --> 00:29:39.980
like serve coffee, like over
and over and over again,

523
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:45.700
which exhausting and annoying. And
I think you've learned just

524
00:29:45.730 --> 00:29:48.790
ways to deal with it.
I am lucky in that.

525
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:51.370
I, so when I learned
to code, I learned to

526
00:29:51.370 --> 00:29:54.430
code an organization called icy
stars. I was a nonprofit

527
00:29:54.430 --> 00:30:00.190
in Chicago that does basically,
they, they teach people who

528
00:30:00.190 --> 00:30:04.870
are interested in technology to
build applications, web based applications

529
00:30:04.870 --> 00:30:09.130
for community based organizations in
their area. So there's a

530
00:30:09.130 --> 00:30:17.230
whole network and community of
like minded folks who are

531
00:30:17.230 --> 00:30:22.150
geeks for what it enables.
And not necessarily like, I

532
00:30:22.150 --> 00:30:24.310
mean, I'd have nothing against
like geeks who are just

533
00:30:24.340 --> 00:30:27.520
geeks because tech is cool,
but I'm really excited about

534
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:31.270
like, what are the, you
know, real life use case

535
00:30:31.270 --> 00:30:34.750
scenarios and how we can
like change people's lives. And

536
00:30:34.750 --> 00:30:36.880
that's what I get excited
about. And so I am

537
00:30:36.880 --> 00:30:38.890
lucky in that. I do
have a community of folks

538
00:30:38.890 --> 00:30:41.760
who are like minded. That's
really cool. I think it's

539
00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.100
so important. And I think
the listeners should really think

540
00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:47.580
about this. There's so many
aspects to our identity. You

541
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.720
know, there's the obvious outward
stuff. There's the inner stuff

542
00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:54.660
you can't see whether it
be diseases or backgrounds or

543
00:30:54.660 --> 00:30:57.600
whatever. And you got to
find your tribe. Don't you,

544
00:30:57.990 --> 00:31:00.690
whoever your tribe, it could
be civic-minded coders. It could

545
00:31:00.690 --> 00:31:04.590
be people who are diabetic
or, or wounded veterans or

546
00:31:04.590 --> 00:31:07.800
whatever, or maybe intersectionally. You
are all of those things.

547
00:31:09.030 --> 00:31:12.780
And it's really freaking cool
to see somebody who's like

548
00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:17.820
you and it just clicks
Just super affirming. Sometimes we

549
00:31:17.830 --> 00:31:20.130
talk about the isolation sometimes
you're like, am I crazy?

550
00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.740
Am I the only one
who do thinks these crazy

551
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.780
thoughts? Am I the only
one who spends hours, like

552
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:27.690
trying to figure out these
hacks? And then you meet

553
00:31:27.690 --> 00:31:30.570
people who are like you
and it's really, really affirming.

554
00:31:31.110 --> 00:31:35.610
Hmm. And I find being
a remote that the imposter

555
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:39.630
syndrome becomes even greater because
the voices in your head

556
00:31:39.630 --> 00:31:41.490
for lack of a better
word are louder when you're

557
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:44.100
by yourself. And it's just
nice to have someone tell

558
00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:47.880
you they have more space
than time. Yeah. Well, this

559
00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.280
is great. You're doing some
really exciting stuff. And where

560
00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:52.200
can people follow you on
Twitter and, and, and hear

561
00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:55.110
about what you're doing. So
I'm Twitter, I'm Michael solution.

562
00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:59.340
And my K E L
L solution. Our website is

563
00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:08.190
BSM dlt.co vsm.co. Yeah. Very
cool. Well, we'll make sure

564
00:32:08.190 --> 00:32:09.660
to put those in the
show notes so people can

565
00:32:09.660 --> 00:32:12.720
link directly to them from
the website. Tiffany, Michael, thanks

566
00:32:12.720 --> 00:32:14.430
so much for chatting with
me today. Thank you, Scott.

567
00:32:14.430 --> 00:32:16.710
It was a pleasure. This
has been another episode of

568
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:18.900
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
