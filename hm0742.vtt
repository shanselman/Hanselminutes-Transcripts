00:00:00.150 --> 00:00:02.790
No one wants to manage
databases. If they can avoid

2
00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:07.560
it. That's why Mongo DB
made Mongo DB Atlas, a

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:11.910
global cloud database service that
runs on AWS, GCP and

4
00:00:11.910 --> 00:00:15.810
Azure. You can deploy a
fully managed Mongo DB database

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.540
in minutes with just a
few clicks or a few

6
00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:24.090
API calls, Mongo DB, Atlas,
automates deployment, automates updates, handles

7
00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:26.580
scaling, and more so that
you can focus on your

8
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.330
application instead of taking care
of your database, you can

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.720
get started free@mongodb.com slash Atlas.
Now, if you're already managing

10
00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:40.440
a Mongo DB deployment, Atlas
has a live migration service,

11
00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:43.680
so you can migrate it
easily with minimal downtime and

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:46.740
then get back to what
matters. Stop managing your database

13
00:00:47.070 --> 00:01:03.720
and start using Mongo DB
Atlas. Alright, this is Scott

14
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:06.510
Hanselman. This is number one
minutes today. I'm talking with

15
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.960
dr. Denise. She is a
researcher in the software analysis,

16
00:01:09.990 --> 00:01:13.880
intelligent st. Group at Microsoft.
How are you? I'm good,

17
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:16.790
Scott, how are you doing?
I'm getting there. I'm happy

18
00:01:16.790 --> 00:01:19.490
to be chatting with you.
I just, I do not

19
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:20.930
have a PhD and I
will tell you, I am

20
00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:23.750
intimidated by people with them
because it's so fun to

21
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:26.750
get to think and analyze
for a living. Did you

22
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.510
know that you wanted to
think that deeply from the

23
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:33.080
very beginning? That's a good
question. So I didn't always

24
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.630
know I wanted a PhD
actually that happened throughout my

25
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:38.480
undergraduate research experience, but I
knew, I liked to think

26
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.750
deeply about some problems and
be able to analyze data

27
00:01:41.750 --> 00:01:43.940
and figure out how we
can design systems to build

28
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.670
things so I can give
them a laundry list of

29
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.150
cool high school projects I
did, but I was really

30
00:01:50.150 --> 00:01:52.480
interested in helping people and
the ability to have the

31
00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:55.490
systems around them. So apps
and things like that in

32
00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.370
high school. So it kind
of really sparked my interest

33
00:01:58.370 --> 00:02:01.820
in computer science. So, Hmm.
And when people say, think

34
00:02:01.820 --> 00:02:05.000
deeply about something, sometimes people
like poke poke at that

35
00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.650
and they say, you're thinking
too much. Like it's not

36
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.800
that hard, right? They'll look
at the science of interpersonal

37
00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.290
reactions, but it is a,
it is a science, like

38
00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.350
there are scientific methods. Are
there not to make people

39
00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:19.460
get along better work in
teams, better include people in

40
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.360
teams better. It's not just,
just, Hey, y'all relax. It's

41
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:25.610
not that big of a
deal. Oh yeah, for sure.

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.760
There's, we're definitely applying the
scientific process for these things

43
00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:32.120
where we're identifying strategic research
questions or we're carving out

44
00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:35.360
those areas. So we can
build the research questions and

45
00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.330
design the correct methodology to
figure out with the best

46
00:02:38.330 --> 00:02:41.410
way to approach this question
or based on whether the

47
00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:44.000
answers we're interested in. So
a lot of my work

48
00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:49.010
takes a mixed methods approach
where it's qualitatively identifying and

49
00:02:49.010 --> 00:02:53.060
then quantitatively validating to understand
the challenges that programmers face

50
00:02:53.060 --> 00:02:56.720
when asking for help the
mechanisms that they use to

51
00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:01.810
help them encourage participation and
there designing on platform mechanisms

52
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.140
to encourage that desire participation.
So my work is at

53
00:03:05.140 --> 00:03:08.230
the intersection of software engineering
and human computer interaction and

54
00:03:08.260 --> 00:03:10.750
online community. So it's important
to be able to design

55
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:15.570
methodologies that are responsive to
those. So the intersection between

56
00:03:15.570 --> 00:03:17.970
those two spaces, so your
PhD is in computer science,

57
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.880
but you also have a
focus on, on cognitive science

58
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:22.920
is that, that is how
the brain thinks and works.

59
00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:25.050
Yeah, Yes. That is exactly.
You have the brain thinks

60
00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.230
and works. So I was
really excited about doing this

61
00:03:28.230 --> 00:03:31.560
minor graduate minor in cognitive
science, something I always wanted

62
00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.690
to do an undergraduate by
that didn't really have quite

63
00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:36.660
the time cause I was
an athlete and trying to

64
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:39.450
finish computer science for four
years. So it was important

65
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:42.000
for my research area, as
I was blossoming, to be

66
00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.720
able to understand how people
learn about systems, how they

67
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:49.080
learn, how the interact with
one another and how does

68
00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:52.680
it influence their technical output.
So the minor to graduate

69
00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.480
minor gave me a little
bit more insight into how

70
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.290
those things work, especially for
eye movements, I'm movement. So

71
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:00.360
that one is the one
that I think is like,

72
00:04:00.360 --> 00:04:02.040
you have a ton of
publications and by the way,

73
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:04.080
like it may not seem
like, like fun to the

74
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.200
folks that are listening. But
if you discover a cool

75
00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:09.900
PhD, I like to collect
PhDs and like share them

76
00:04:09.900 --> 00:04:12.990
like Pokemon. Like, could you
read this paper? Have you

77
00:04:12.990 --> 00:04:16.710
seen dr. Ford's work because
you are very prolific and

78
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:19.290
a number of your papers
are really, really, actually really

79
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:21.180
interesting to read, which I
don't think that the lay

80
00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:24.240
person would think, Hey yeah,
reading PhD papers is super

81
00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.500
fun. It actually is. But
the eye tracking one and

82
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:29.970
that the work that you
have been doing in the

83
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:32.370
space of eye tracking is
interesting. Maybe you could explain

84
00:04:32.370 --> 00:04:34.980
why, what is eye tracking
measure and why is it

85
00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:39.690
significant? Yeah. So one study
that maybe mentioning is a

86
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:44.400
study. I did to understand
how developers reviewed contributions. So

87
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:48.360
how they reviewed pull requests
on GitHub. And the reason

88
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:49.860
we went to figure out
was that there was a

89
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:54.360
lot of hypotheses or people
were speculating about how social

90
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.150
signals would be used or
if they're important or not

91
00:04:57.150 --> 00:04:59.730
in how we evaluate our
technical contribution of a pull

92
00:04:59.730 --> 00:05:04.140
request where ideally the technical
contribution should just be the

93
00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:07.290
code, write the code snippet
period. Don't even look at

94
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:09.630
the comment don't even to
look at the issue, commit

95
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:12.100
the issue that may, this
may have been attached to

96
00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:14.580
them. And I want to
design a study to figure

97
00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:17.370
out if that was really
the case, how developers actually

98
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:21.390
reviewed pool requests and versus
what they actually said. So

99
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.990
would they report it Interesting.
So sometimes I feel like

100
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:28.020
like naysayers in the space
of inclusion are just like,

101
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:29.880
Hey, it's just code. Like
everybody can write code. Why

102
00:05:29.880 --> 00:05:32.490
are we worrying about people
and personalities and, and race

103
00:05:32.490 --> 00:05:34.710
and gender and faces like
that. They try to dismiss

104
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:36.630
these things because like you're
saying the only thing that

105
00:05:36.630 --> 00:05:39.930
should matter is the code.
Are you saying that if

106
00:05:39.930 --> 00:05:44.310
there is additional peripheral context
around a pull request that

107
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:47.130
that can affect how I
might react to the book?

108
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:50.310
Oh, for sure. So what
I'll say is that, so

109
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:53.010
for the study where we're
using this, I, my hypothesis

110
00:05:53.010 --> 00:05:56.670
that if people are looking
at this content, then they

111
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.850
are attending to it as
it is on their mind,

112
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:01.790
not to say that it's
using this Ima hypotheses, not

113
00:06:01.790 --> 00:06:05.030
to say that they are,
is it distinct factor or

114
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:08.240
significant in their decision process,
but we know it is

115
00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:12.590
of value in some way,
period. Right? So the point

116
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:14.720
of the experiment was to
see how people are, are

117
00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:18.650
using that information. So if
GitHub is truly, or how

118
00:06:18.650 --> 00:06:20.870
we do pull requests, how
we review that whole code

119
00:06:20.870 --> 00:06:23.780
review process, if it's truly
a meritocracy, nothing else should

120
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:26.570
matter. Then the code will
be found out actually was

121
00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:29.450
that after doing a pre
and post survey, in addition

122
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:31.940
to the study of reviewing
these pull requests of an

123
00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:36.860
identifiable woman, identifiable man, and
an unidentifiable person that people

124
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:39.830
do actually use the avatar
image, which is very small

125
00:06:39.830 --> 00:06:41.690
on the pull requests, the
single commit of a pull

126
00:06:41.690 --> 00:06:46.220
request page, it's very small
area surface area there, but

127
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:50.300
all our participants reviewed that
information, even though only one

128
00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:52.760
reported that it was valuable
to them in some way.

129
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:55.340
Right? So whether or not
we are aware that we're

130
00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:58.100
using this information, we are
attending to it. And it's

131
00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:00.200
important that to know that
this is our way of

132
00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:04.550
understanding the unconscious decisions that
we're making and value structures

133
00:07:04.550 --> 00:07:06.740
that we have. So for
another one, a part of

134
00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:10.610
that was looking at, let's
see the technical peripheral content

135
00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:15.890
such as the commit message,
this person's previous projects, they're

136
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:19.670
pinned projects, the rate of
contribution. So the contribution heat

137
00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:22.910
map, these are all examples
of technical, that technical peripheral

138
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.170
information you were asking about
that are value to code

139
00:07:27.170 --> 00:07:30.550
reviewers. Okay. I feel like
there's a ton to unpack

140
00:07:30.550 --> 00:07:33.880
there. I want to roll
back over a couple of

141
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:36.070
things. I don't want to
hit them for the, for

142
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:39.070
the audience and for myself.
So first thing you talked

143
00:07:39.070 --> 00:07:41.770
about was, and you said
it very fast, the I

144
00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:45.730
mind hypothesis. So what is,
what is that, what does

145
00:07:45.730 --> 00:07:48.190
that hypothesis, what is the
relationship or the postulate that

146
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.170
that is making from the
way the eye and the

147
00:07:50.170 --> 00:07:53.770
mind develop information that comes
in? Right? So the, the

148
00:07:53.770 --> 00:07:56.680
postulate there is that way
we understand the world the

149
00:07:56.680 --> 00:08:00.220
way we process information. One
way of doing that is

150
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:05.230
through, through our eyes, through
vision as, and that's our

151
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:08.950
way of taking in content.
And we use this tool

152
00:08:08.950 --> 00:08:12.430
of vision in order to
understand the world and to

153
00:08:12.430 --> 00:08:16.120
make our decisions for pool
requests. It's a very for

154
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:19.480
reviewing code on your desktop,
the tools you have to

155
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.360
do that you'd only have
your vision, right. And your

156
00:08:22.360 --> 00:08:24.940
cursor, and that's all the
only tool you're using to

157
00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:27.820
digest that information. So that's
the tool that was used

158
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:31.780
to measure how much of
interest that content was. And

159
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.050
again, can really distinct use
the value, right? Based on

160
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.750
the study that we were
doing there, we're seeing some

161
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:41.740
additional factors to manage that.
But the Ima hypothesis, again,

162
00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.040
is you are attending to
which you're looking at as

163
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:48.220
in, you were, you were
taking in which you're looking

164
00:08:48.220 --> 00:08:53.110
at that is of consideration.
Okay. So paraphrasing it for

165
00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:57.660
my understanding, it doesn't say,
Oh, this person rejects women's

166
00:08:57.690 --> 00:09:01.200
pull requests because clearly their
eye goes to the profile

167
00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.530
picture or this person rejects
pull requests of a certain

168
00:09:04.770 --> 00:09:06.900
race because they look at
that. It is simply an

169
00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:11.520
acknowledgement that what their eye
fixates on is part of

170
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.630
the processing. It doesn't make
any qualitative judgment. It simply

171
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:18.180
tracks the quantity like, Oh,
they glanced there. That's a

172
00:09:18.180 --> 00:09:21.030
thing. There was no lag
between what they fixated on

173
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.750
and what they processed. Right.
So also in addition to

174
00:09:23.750 --> 00:09:26.360
that, we did see quite
a bit of fixation on

175
00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:28.350
these areas, right? So there's
also in the case, it

176
00:09:28.350 --> 00:09:31.520
is of importance or of
some type of value system,

177
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:35.420
right. To say, so you
can use the fixation. So

178
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.640
as the, when people focus
on a certain area of

179
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.730
interest and a combination with
the scan path, which is

180
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.690
a series of fixations, to
be able to understand what

181
00:09:44.810 --> 00:09:49.160
other values or what other
areas of interest contribute to

182
00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.250
making a decision. Right. Yeah.
Interesting. And that's, that's something

183
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:54.560
proposed to think about. So
you might be thinking as

184
00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:57.080
you're listening to this show
that like, there are judgment

185
00:09:57.080 --> 00:09:59.660
calls that are being made
or that someone is going

186
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.130
to judge you based on
what you look at when

187
00:10:01.130 --> 00:10:02.600
you're looking at a pull
request. But we know that

188
00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.890
gaze techniques are used to
make people look at ads

189
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.250
like layouts of popular websites
and news sites are set

190
00:10:10.250 --> 00:10:12.860
up to optimize for what
they want you to look

191
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:15.830
at. Like the environment that
are manmade versus ones that

192
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:19.340
are, that are natural are
treated differently. Like you have

193
00:10:19.340 --> 00:10:22.250
to say, this was a
designed page. Did my eye

194
00:10:22.250 --> 00:10:24.050
go where it needed to
go to do what I

195
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:26.090
needed to do was the,
was this page optimized for

196
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:30.200
my tasks? Right. Right, exactly.
So this is no slide

197
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.120
at the designers of GitHub.
This is how we review

198
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.270
code, right? These are, these
are signals that are available

199
00:10:35.270 --> 00:10:38.000
to us. So you go
to somebody's main profile page,

200
00:10:38.090 --> 00:10:41.060
the avatar image is fairly
large and you have the

201
00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:43.220
rate of contribution. So you
can use it as your

202
00:10:43.220 --> 00:10:46.580
CV, essentially, you know, this
can be comparable to how

203
00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:50.330
we evaluate technical contributions in
other spaces. This is the

204
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:52.970
norm that we've set for
understanding other people who may

205
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.520
be contributing to our work.
So figuring out how that

206
00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:58.370
translates is important. Yeah. Now
in the, in the eighties

207
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.250
and I fixation study was
done with someone named carpenter

208
00:11:01.550 --> 00:11:04.400
and I've heard the term
carpentered environments, is that a

209
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:07.580
coincidence, the idea of a
created environment versus a natural

210
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:11.150
environment? That's actually a coincidence.
I think I'm not really

211
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:14.480
sure. The reason I ask
is that, you know, I

212
00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:17.360
fixation and comprehension was done
in the, in the eighties

213
00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:20.480
by Patricia Carpenter at Carnegie Mellon.
And then I hear about

214
00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:23.690
carpentered environments, which is just
a way of saying environments

215
00:11:23.690 --> 00:11:26.240
that have been built except
it's used with a lowercase

216
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:28.910
C. So I was kind
of curious if Patricia Carpenter had

217
00:11:28.910 --> 00:11:30.590
kind of like come up
with that, or that was

218
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:32.810
just a total coincidence. I
don't know. I would say

219
00:11:32.820 --> 00:11:35.000
there may be a, there's
a great coincidence. I know

220
00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.060
the breakdown normally site for
the, I, my hypothesis is

221
00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:42.590
just in carpenter. So Patricia Carpenter,
but that is actually really

222
00:11:42.590 --> 00:11:45.080
interesting. I mean, I also,
this, I might have policies

223
00:11:45.080 --> 00:11:49.070
will apply to other spaces
as well, even beyond manmade

224
00:11:49.070 --> 00:11:52.880
systems. Right. And so the
same way of you're looking

225
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:55.330
out window and you see
a butterfly, right. Or you're

226
00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:58.570
following, you're following the path,
right. This is the equivalent

227
00:11:58.720 --> 00:12:02.080
of like the Ima hypothesis
that I'm referring to for

228
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.090
code review. Yeah, indeed. And
your paper talks about how,

229
00:12:06.120 --> 00:12:09.090
you know, one's attention has
to be sustained and focus.

230
00:12:09.090 --> 00:12:12.090
One is by, in programming
and thinking and analyzing a

231
00:12:12.090 --> 00:12:16.260
pull request or doing anything
with code requires sustained attention

232
00:12:16.260 --> 00:12:20.460
so that it makes sense
that eye gaze and the,

233
00:12:20.460 --> 00:12:22.350
what did you call it?
The path, the standard path,

234
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:27.540
yes. Would be very valuable
data. Yeah. So you're drawing

235
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:30.540
a relationship between the shifts
of attention and this thing

236
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.900
called a saccade. What is
this? Oh. Or people could

237
00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:37.320
possible people pronounce it, many
different ways to Kate's one

238
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:39.810
way to understand this, a
cut that people make is

239
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:43.380
when people are focusing on
an area and your eye

240
00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.160
to, in order to capture
the entire area, your eye

241
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:51.000
movements are doing a, a
set of quick movements, actually

242
00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:55.380
in order to understand a
full experience. So I'll give

243
00:12:55.380 --> 00:12:58.980
an example. When, when you're
reading a sentence on paper,

244
00:12:59.430 --> 00:13:01.620
the way you read it
in the U S in

245
00:13:01.630 --> 00:13:05.340
American national language is from
left to right. Of course.

246
00:13:05.700 --> 00:13:08.400
And when you're taking in
the sentence, when you're reading,

247
00:13:08.400 --> 00:13:10.260
you would find that your
gaze does a little bit

248
00:13:10.260 --> 00:13:13.980
of a couple skips, right?
You're skipping over areas. Cause

249
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.810
you kind of have a
grip on what those words

250
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:18.030
are and your brain is
trying to understand the rest

251
00:13:18.030 --> 00:13:22.170
of the passage and actually
have a video. Obviously can't

252
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:24.080
show on book podcasts, but
I have a link on

253
00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.950
my blog. I'll put a
link in the show notes.

254
00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:28.680
I have a link on
my blog actually shows that

255
00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:32.670
even before one of our
participants could review a pull

256
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:35.880
request or could confirm out
loud the decision to accept

257
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.060
or decline or merge or
not merged as pull requests.

258
00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:42.390
They do a series of
sockets when they're focusing on

259
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:44.550
area. So when they're looking
at the actual code snippet

260
00:13:44.820 --> 00:13:47.790
for review, they're doing a
bunch of quick little jumps

261
00:13:48.030 --> 00:13:51.390
around that area as a
way of reading, right? And

262
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:53.700
the skin path that you
can consider is the series

263
00:13:53.700 --> 00:13:58.230
of those movements for different
areas of interests. Interesting. One

264
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:00.030
of the things that we
think about is we want

265
00:14:00.030 --> 00:14:02.760
to think about are our
bias, our implicit bias, our

266
00:14:02.760 --> 00:14:04.770
internal bias, and you didn't
just go and say, well,

267
00:14:04.770 --> 00:14:06.600
this is about women and
men. You also had a,

268
00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:09.690
an icon, an avatar that
was just a, one of

269
00:14:09.690 --> 00:14:12.540
those blobs. One of those
generated gravity bars. But you

270
00:14:12.540 --> 00:14:15.180
also looked at the get
graph that green graph at

271
00:14:15.180 --> 00:14:17.970
the bottom, which I think
makes me feel guilty about

272
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.580
myself. Like I'm not working
hard enough, but I started

273
00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:24.600
to realize after, after reading
your papers, that I am

274
00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:28.980
applying a huge amount to
that green graph indicating that,

275
00:14:29.250 --> 00:14:31.440
well, they must know what
they're doing because it's really

276
00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:33.540
green at the bottom there.
Right. And I don't know

277
00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.310
if that's a good bias
or not, but you had

278
00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:37.980
me because I thought about
this. I realized, wow, my

279
00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:41.940
eye is consistently drawn to
this big green blob. What

280
00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:44.220
do I do with that?
Now that you've, now that

281
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.260
you've told me that this
is a thing I don't

282
00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:48.330
know, do do I do
anything at all? Well, I

283
00:14:48.330 --> 00:14:51.410
mean, this is important to
acknowledge that you know, that

284
00:14:51.410 --> 00:14:53.990
we all have these systems
that are set up and

285
00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:56.750
the who, that's, how we
interpret these pages. Right? And

286
00:14:56.750 --> 00:14:58.490
we get in our own
rhythm and cadence of how

287
00:14:58.490 --> 00:15:01.940
to interpret those things. The
green, large graph, the contribution

288
00:15:01.940 --> 00:15:04.280
graph heat map, as I
sometimes call it is at

289
00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:06.320
the center of the page,
depending on, you know, is

290
00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:08.900
it the center slightly to
the right, but in the

291
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:12.260
middle of the page. So
it's naturally gravitate to your

292
00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:14.510
attention and those items that
are larger. We'll also do

293
00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:17.000
that as well, especially there.
So there's something that my

294
00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.370
colleagues were bringing up as
this ability for humans to

295
00:15:19.370 --> 00:15:21.500
focus on our face or
sister, it shouldn't identify a

296
00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:24.590
face. So that's also like
a threat, right? If you're

297
00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:27.650
looking for someone like you,
right. You're trying to identify

298
00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:30.950
how normal something is. You're,
you're going to be drawn

299
00:15:30.950 --> 00:15:34.070
to the face, right? If
your establishment of normal is

300
00:15:34.070 --> 00:15:37.880
to say, Oh, their productivity
is important. That contribution heat

301
00:15:37.900 --> 00:15:40.850
map is going to be
a focus point for you

302
00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:43.430
a focal point. So, but
it's also funny that you

303
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.400
mentioned the contribution heat map
because people can gain that

304
00:15:46.790 --> 00:15:49.910
people draw cute little figures
and chat intention to contribute

305
00:15:49.910 --> 00:15:52.580
on certain days and X
amount of times on certain

306
00:15:52.580 --> 00:15:55.250
days. So it can write
high or a cool message

307
00:15:55.310 --> 00:15:58.360
on their profile page, Which
is a really great point.

308
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.850
So if I were using
that to judge whether or

309
00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:02.890
not I would hire someone
or interview them, I can't

310
00:16:02.890 --> 00:16:05.980
trust it. It's an unreliable
narrator just as the avatar

311
00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:08.020
is an unreliable narrator. It
could be a Simpson's character,

312
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:11.440
as far as I know
Exactly, exactly. Actually in this

313
00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:13.630
study, we also not in
this paper that we publish,

314
00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.460
but this is all part
of a larger study. We

315
00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:18.550
also do this implicit association
test to be able to

316
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:22.720
understand. So this is the
Harvard implicit association tests where

317
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:25.810
anyone can actually go online
and test to see what

318
00:16:25.810 --> 00:16:29.980
their associations with gender science
or gender career would be.

319
00:16:30.310 --> 00:16:33.370
And we actually had our
participants go through that as

320
00:16:33.370 --> 00:16:36.160
well. And that's kind of
upcoming in another study, but

321
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.280
to see how that can
influence afterwards, after they complete

322
00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:43.660
the code review process, how
that influenced their decisions. And

323
00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:45.130
we all have bias. So
we had a lot of

324
00:16:45.130 --> 00:16:49.090
women who also Grande the
gamut, right. Of associating men

325
00:16:49.090 --> 00:16:54.040
with computer science and women
with liberal arts. Yeah. Hey

326
00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.470
friends, you know how I
love great podcasts. And I

327
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:59.350
want you to check out
the code newbie podcasts, all

328
00:16:59.350 --> 00:17:03.430
about stories from folks on
their coding journey. They talk

329
00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.580
to new developers, experienced developers
and everyone in between about

330
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:09.640
how they got started learning
to code how they navigate

331
00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:12.850
their technical careers. And they
also do deep dives into

332
00:17:12.850 --> 00:17:16.690
technical topics in a newbie
friendly way, check out their

333
00:17:16.690 --> 00:17:21.940
podcast at www dot code
newbie. That's new B I

334
00:17:21.940 --> 00:17:30.040
e.org/podcast. That's code newbie.org/podcast. I
think that it's important, the

335
00:17:30.040 --> 00:17:31.780
whole point of these things
and why I liked having

336
00:17:31.780 --> 00:17:34.900
these conversations is that I
think some people feel like

337
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.690
this is work that you're
using to make me whoever

338
00:17:37.690 --> 00:17:41.650
I am feel guilty about
whatever context I come from.

339
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.680
I look at this differently
as, as a, I never

340
00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.270
thought about it like that.
That's a little piece of

341
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:48.760
information that I can file
away so that I think

342
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:52.050
when review, like I, I
catch myself and I go,

343
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.050
Oh, wow. I didn't realize
I was noticing the, the

344
00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:57.510
avatar or I was noticing
the graph and not thinking

345
00:17:57.510 --> 00:18:00.090
about the code. Why was
my eye taken there? And

346
00:18:00.090 --> 00:18:01.920
you actually call it in
your blog posts that the

347
00:18:02.190 --> 00:18:05.940
get hub in 2010 profile
page is dramatically different than

348
00:18:05.940 --> 00:18:09.120
the redesign in 2018, which
is designed to be more

349
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.690
friendly and more approachable. But
it really actually deemphasizes activity.

350
00:18:12.930 --> 00:18:15.710
And at the emphasizes the
code. Yeah. I mean, even

351
00:18:15.740 --> 00:18:18.590
I've seen on Twitter recently,
I think a couple developers

352
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.930
who are working on GitHub,
we're showcasing some, you think

353
00:18:21.080 --> 00:18:23.900
even cooler attribution you can
make to your profile page.

354
00:18:24.890 --> 00:18:27.170
I mean, it's GitHub being
like a social coding platform,

355
00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:30.410
which is definitely a draw
for why people go there.

356
00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.960
It's as important to note
that, you know, maybe this

357
00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:35.060
allows people to bring their
authentic selves to their whole

358
00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:38.840
programming experience now. Right. So
being mindful of that and

359
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.690
what that looks like and
how that could hopefully build

360
00:18:41.690 --> 00:18:44.930
a more inclusive online programming
community. So when you make

361
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.030
a study like this, or
the many other studies that

362
00:18:47.030 --> 00:18:50.570
you've done, are you coming
up with a, a hypothesis

363
00:18:50.570 --> 00:18:52.250
ahead of time? Like I,
like I learned in high

364
00:18:52.250 --> 00:18:55.220
school science, like, I think
this is a thing. And

365
00:18:55.220 --> 00:18:56.540
then you work for a
year to prove that it's

366
00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:58.040
a thing or not. And
then do you tell us

367
00:18:58.040 --> 00:18:59.840
what we should do about
that? Or do you just

368
00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:02.810
leave the conclusion up to
the reader? This is ASA.

369
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:05.690
Great question. So my research
and my dissertation area, kind

370
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:09.200
of those all three of
first identifying well looking at

371
00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:12.950
previous literature to really understand
the area, the research area,

372
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.030
but identifying the barriers and
challenges that people face in

373
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:20.900
these communities mine's was focusing
initially well on gender. And

374
00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:23.240
we identified barriers that exist
for people across the gender

375
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:27.680
spectrum. From there, identifying what
tools or techniques and mechanisms

376
00:19:27.680 --> 00:19:30.320
people are using to kind
of overcome those challenges and

377
00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.260
those barriers. And then like
the last major phase of

378
00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:36.590
my dissertation was the stack
overflow mentorship program that I

379
00:19:36.590 --> 00:19:40.010
worked on with stack overflow
to devise a better onboarding

380
00:19:40.010 --> 00:19:43.760
experience, to welcome newcomers or
novice question askers and get

381
00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:46.630
them help from expert users.
So I like for my

382
00:19:46.670 --> 00:19:48.470
users to be able to
hit all those points of

383
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.540
like, we have to know
where we've been to know

384
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.990
where we're going. So we
have to identify both things

385
00:19:54.230 --> 00:19:57.440
and then identify the problem.
What are people doing? How

386
00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.010
can we adapt that at
scale or scale ish. And

387
00:20:01.010 --> 00:20:03.650
then, Yeah. And on the
stack overflow, one that you

388
00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:07.100
did, you called out that
if women ask a question

389
00:20:07.100 --> 00:20:09.110
on stack overflow for the
first or second time, and

390
00:20:09.110 --> 00:20:12.710
the reply comes from someone
who is identifiably, a woman,

391
00:20:12.710 --> 00:20:14.660
they feel somehow more and
more welcomed and they're more

392
00:20:14.660 --> 00:20:17.480
likely to come back. Which
I think is what I

393
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.550
always like to say is
if technology looks like the

394
00:20:19.550 --> 00:20:21.920
mall, which I like going
to the mall, I like

395
00:20:21.930 --> 00:20:23.390
the way that I like
the way the mall makes

396
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:25.760
me feel. I like the
way downtown Manhattan makes me

397
00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.030
feel because it's people from
everywhere. If stack overflow, if

398
00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:33.080
online communities, wherever they are,
feel like that, then everyone

399
00:20:33.080 --> 00:20:36.260
feels better and everybody wins.
Yeah. Yeah. So I'm really

400
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:39.290
trying to figure out how
to recreate those feelings. Right.

401
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:42.740
And that exact product you
mentioned was with women, but

402
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:45.710
what does that look like
for culture? Right? So stack

403
00:20:45.710 --> 00:20:49.510
overflow, you, they don't actually
data about, or isn't that

404
00:20:49.570 --> 00:20:52.660
self reported about your gender
or so you, but you

405
00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:55.840
do have access to what
country you're from. People can

406
00:20:55.910 --> 00:20:58.360
self report what country they're
from. So maybe if I'm

407
00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.730
a developer from Egypt and
I see other developers from

408
00:21:00.730 --> 00:21:03.610
Egypt, engaging in the communities,
kind of like, okay, I

409
00:21:03.610 --> 00:21:06.850
have a shared identity with
someone. Right. I can see

410
00:21:06.850 --> 00:21:08.920
that. I could see a
bit of myself in them,

411
00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:12.370
the references they use when
time to clarify programming problems.

412
00:21:12.640 --> 00:21:14.560
And it's like, Oh, okay.
I see that there's a

413
00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.170
space for me here. And
we want to figure how

414
00:21:17.170 --> 00:21:19.680
we can recreate those. It's
it's funny that you say

415
00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:21.990
that because there's all these,
all these little things that

416
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:23.850
make up one's identity, where
they grew up with went

417
00:21:23.850 --> 00:21:26.070
to high school, we all
know how we feel. It's

418
00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:28.290
like, Oh, you went to
my high school. Did you

419
00:21:28.290 --> 00:21:30.090
know? So and so, and
then suddenly someone who was

420
00:21:30.090 --> 00:21:33.660
a stranger five minutes ago
isn't right, right. And one

421
00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:36.630
of the aspects of my
personality or my, my identity

422
00:21:36.630 --> 00:21:40.080
is that I'm a type
one diabetic, but it's invisible.

423
00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:42.990
It's not a thing you
see, but I have tubing,

424
00:21:42.990 --> 00:21:46.260
I have medical implants. I've
got a number of, of

425
00:21:46.920 --> 00:21:49.530
needles and tubes and things
in the batteries that are

426
00:21:49.530 --> 00:21:51.330
all over me. But if
you don't see them, they're

427
00:21:51.330 --> 00:21:53.340
not a thing. But if
I am out in the

428
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:54.930
world or I'm at a
conference or whatever, and I

429
00:21:54.930 --> 00:21:58.230
see someone else's tubing coming
out of their clothes, I'll

430
00:21:58.230 --> 00:21:59.580
go and I'll touch them
on the arm and I'll

431
00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:01.890
go, Hey, and I'll show
him my insulin pump. And

432
00:22:01.890 --> 00:22:04.590
then we will clink our
pumps together. Kind of like,

433
00:22:04.590 --> 00:22:06.870
you know, when you go
cheers and you clink glasses

434
00:22:06.870 --> 00:22:09.600
together, and it's like suddenly
a total stranger as a

435
00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:12.780
friend. And then we're talking
about our journey with this

436
00:22:12.780 --> 00:22:16.860
invisible disability. And it sounds
silly, but if I give

437
00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:18.390
a talk and I'm like,
how many diabetics are in

438
00:22:18.390 --> 00:22:19.950
the house? And like five
hands go up. It's like,

439
00:22:19.950 --> 00:22:24.120
yeah, my people, that's a
good feeling. And there's so

440
00:22:24.120 --> 00:22:25.980
many different ways. It could
be, Hey, people from Portland

441
00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.740
or Hey, former Microsoft user,
Hey, whatever. And that's a

442
00:22:28.740 --> 00:22:30.990
nice feeling and we should
make everyone feel like that.

443
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.120
Right. And that's the difference.
That's the first side of

444
00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.230
inclusion that sometimes people don't
really isn't as clear. Right.

445
00:22:37.230 --> 00:22:39.870
Isn't and I think it's
something that's really easy to

446
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.020
highlight, you know, allowing us
to understand that are shared

447
00:22:43.020 --> 00:22:45.600
identities and people who even
don't look like you. Right.

448
00:22:45.930 --> 00:22:48.540
So you've talked about that
with the diabetic experience, right?

449
00:22:48.750 --> 00:22:50.970
You knew you saw it
there, their core coming out

450
00:22:50.970 --> 00:22:53.730
their shirt and you're Oh,
let's let's connect. That doesn't

451
00:22:53.730 --> 00:22:57.690
necessarily mean that person was
also like also from America

452
00:22:57.990 --> 00:23:01.620
or also a white person
or also a man, you

453
00:23:01.620 --> 00:23:04.920
know? So I think it's
important to acknowledge that there

454
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.800
are different ways to amplify
those shared differences and those

455
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:11.760
shared experiences that add value
to those who feel marginalized,

456
00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.550
who are marginalized. And, but
the point is to not

457
00:23:14.790 --> 00:23:17.100
just have them in their
corner doing their own thing,

458
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:18.600
but so allow them to
feel like they're a part

459
00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:20.730
of the group, the group
at large, the community at

460
00:23:20.730 --> 00:23:24.210
large. Definitely. I want to
shift gears a little bit

461
00:23:24.210 --> 00:23:26.040
because there is a thing
that's been going on Twitter

462
00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:28.410
a lot lately, when we
talk about white board programming

463
00:23:28.410 --> 00:23:30.360
going and sitting in and
like, Hey, we're going to

464
00:23:30.360 --> 00:23:31.650
come work at the company.
You're going to work on

465
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.480
machine learning. Dr. Ford, you
can do all kinds of

466
00:23:33.480 --> 00:23:36.420
really important data work. But
before you do that work,

467
00:23:36.750 --> 00:23:39.210
I want you to draw
a four loop on the

468
00:23:39.210 --> 00:23:43.350
whiteboard. Why, why do we
insist on having people write

469
00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.940
code on a whiteboard and
have trivia questions when it's

470
00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:50.030
universally hated and tends to
be a little bit exclusionary?

471
00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:52.510
That is an age old
question. I wish I knew

472
00:23:52.510 --> 00:23:57.880
the answer to that. I
wish I think it's because

473
00:23:57.910 --> 00:24:01.030
I think so when we're
in our development settings, as

474
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:05.080
a developer, my past, past,
super past life, you go

475
00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:07.360
to the whiteboard to bring
some of those ideas that

476
00:24:07.370 --> 00:24:10.780
some people's main interpretation or
main approach, to be able

477
00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.750
to explain the ideas that
does not work for everyone

478
00:24:14.380 --> 00:24:18.070
that takes practice. So even
for technical coding, interviews, people

479
00:24:18.070 --> 00:24:21.250
practice for those people, practice
being able to speak their

480
00:24:21.250 --> 00:24:24.130
ideas as they're writing them
on the board, that is

481
00:24:24.130 --> 00:24:26.800
not an innate skill that
people have That right there.

482
00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.510
Like, let me just pause
you for a second. Like,

483
00:24:28.570 --> 00:24:30.820
people need to drink that
in for a second. You

484
00:24:30.820 --> 00:24:33.040
know how, when you find
out that someone can't roll

485
00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.590
their tongue and you're like,
are we even related? You

486
00:24:35.590 --> 00:24:37.330
can't roll your tongue like
that. And like, Oh, well,

487
00:24:37.330 --> 00:24:39.550
no, I just never thought
that was a thing. Like

488
00:24:39.550 --> 00:24:41.140
I found that out about
one of my kids recently.

489
00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.790
I don't know the genetics
of it, but I gotta

490
00:24:42.790 --> 00:24:45.340
make a call. But when
I discovered that not everyone

491
00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:49.000
can talk and move at
the same time, like think

492
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.670
and express and you know,
I'm thinking, and here's what's

493
00:24:51.670 --> 00:24:54.100
happening in my head right
now. It's a synchronous thing

494
00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.310
versus an asynchronous thing. Why
would I then exclude those

495
00:24:57.310 --> 00:25:03.400
people accidentally or inadvertently, right.
Exactly. This is exactly what

496
00:25:03.400 --> 00:25:06.370
happened. So, so the one,
one reason or one approach

497
00:25:06.670 --> 00:25:08.770
to even doing this is
freaking out what is this

498
00:25:08.770 --> 00:25:12.610
person's mean form of communicating.
So most developers code the

499
00:25:12.610 --> 00:25:17.200
IDE, right? Yeah. Why aren't
our technical interviews. I'm going

500
00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:19.420
to let people are transitioning
to this mode of giving

501
00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:22.300
someone a project and letting
them work on it remotely

502
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:24.610
and then submit their project
so that they can use

503
00:25:24.610 --> 00:25:28.960
whatever resources, work best for
them. And that's a, that's

504
00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:31.870
a great best practice. Right.
But how do we recreate

505
00:25:31.870 --> 00:25:34.330
that in person, if people
want people to come in

506
00:25:34.330 --> 00:25:37.360
and also have the behavioral
part of the interviews, but

507
00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:39.940
also have I need you
to work on this technical

508
00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.300
task? Yeah. One of the
things that we've tried to

509
00:25:43.300 --> 00:25:45.280
do in the developer division
of the last couple of

510
00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:48.880
years is reboot our, our
interview process, such that we

511
00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.100
actually have people come in
and work on a thing

512
00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.740
side by side with the
actual people, they'd be working

513
00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:56.050
on the thing with, and
the challenges of course you

514
00:25:56.050 --> 00:25:58.600
don't want to accidentally get
free work from them. So

515
00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.490
that's the thing like you
don't, you don't come in

516
00:26:00.490 --> 00:26:02.710
and work for a week
for free. We'll take your

517
00:26:02.710 --> 00:26:03.970
work and then do a
thing. But at the same

518
00:26:03.970 --> 00:26:06.550
time is the work you're
being given in the interview

519
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:10.960
representative of the work you'd
be doing every day. Most

520
00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:13.660
likely no. Most of the
time, no, because you're connecting

521
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.840
with the team. I can
talk briefly about some work

522
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.150
from home findings that, so
another project I'm working on

523
00:26:19.150 --> 00:26:22.390
right now is the work
from home experience for developers.

524
00:26:22.750 --> 00:26:25.720
And one of the main
coats, we did a qualitative

525
00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:28.090
analysis at the medic analysis
on the responses that we

526
00:26:28.090 --> 00:26:31.810
received. And one of that
was really interesting was the

527
00:26:31.810 --> 00:26:35.350
collaboration part of being at
the whiteboard as in being

528
00:26:35.350 --> 00:26:38.350
at the whiteboard with others,
not just yourself, being able

529
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:41.830
to explain new ideas, new
projects. So we've all been

530
00:26:41.830 --> 00:26:44.070
working from home for quite
a while now. So I

531
00:26:44.070 --> 00:26:47.820
used the COVID in 19,
the Puget sound Pacific Northwest

532
00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:52.500
grade area, and people were
previously working on old projects

533
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:54.960
that were wrapping up already
had goals. Outlined what does

534
00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:56.940
it look like now to
outline a new goal? When

535
00:26:56.940 --> 00:26:59.610
your main media of doing
that is lost is no

536
00:26:59.610 --> 00:27:03.890
longer shared. See, I so
true story. I have always

537
00:27:03.890 --> 00:27:06.200
been remote at Microsoft, but
half my team is usually

538
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:09.440
in Redmond. So well, most
of my experiences have been

539
00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:12.260
kind of over Skype over
teams. Now, just in the

540
00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:14.600
last week, I have a
team now of nine, almost

541
00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:18.860
10, 10, if you count
me, how do I reboot

542
00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:20.660
this team? How do I
start us thinking, how do

543
00:27:20.660 --> 00:27:22.790
I start new projects? How
do I get us collaborating?

544
00:27:23.270 --> 00:27:25.550
Is it, you know, is
it word or Google docs

545
00:27:25.550 --> 00:27:27.380
or Dar their teams, like
there's 15 different ways to

546
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:29.750
do it, but I don't
feel like we're getting the

547
00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:33.830
same sense of collaboration because
we're, our hands are like,

548
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:36.320
Novacane, I'd be up there
like numb because these tools

549
00:27:36.530 --> 00:27:38.450
are between us and the
thing that we want to

550
00:27:38.450 --> 00:27:41.750
get out. There's this cognitive
load that is there because

551
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.840
of our remoteness Kind of
complexity this, now it should

552
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:48.350
deuce, or it has increased
right. Where it's harder to

553
00:27:48.350 --> 00:27:52.940
communicate. Right? So that's, that's
another aspect of it that

554
00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.340
you mentioned, like you're, so
I'm not trying to like

555
00:27:55.340 --> 00:28:00.350
diagnose your problem, but, but
the media richness is missing.

556
00:28:00.830 --> 00:28:04.880
Like rich enough, that communication
is gone now. So there

557
00:28:04.880 --> 00:28:08.960
are alternatives like using the
whiteboard on teams, which I

558
00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:11.900
know that some people have
used. It's really helpful if

559
00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:15.710
you have like a pen
or a surface pen or,

560
00:28:16.370 --> 00:28:18.320
you know, otherwise it's hard
to use your cursor. It

561
00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:21.080
wasn't designed. I mean, how
do I say this? There

562
00:28:21.080 --> 00:28:25.160
is a higher challenge And
mismatch, right? A mouse is

563
00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:27.770
not a pen, but no
matter how much Solomon Khan

564
00:28:27.770 --> 00:28:29.600
from the Khan Academy makes
it look like a pen.

565
00:28:30.050 --> 00:28:32.930
It's not. So having a
real, you know, an iPad

566
00:28:33.050 --> 00:28:35.150
with you or a surface
pen, it makes a huge

567
00:28:35.150 --> 00:28:38.600
difference. It does. It does.
Interesting. Yeah. I feel like

568
00:28:38.600 --> 00:28:40.340
that's a whole other show
right there that we'll talk

569
00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:43.580
about. One of the things
that I've been telling, some

570
00:28:43.580 --> 00:28:45.140
of the interns, we just
had a bunch of interns

571
00:28:45.140 --> 00:28:48.110
join and I wanted to
make sure that they knew

572
00:28:48.110 --> 00:28:50.690
that it was okay, that
this is not remote work.

573
00:28:50.690 --> 00:28:54.020
This is something else, but
also an acknowledgement. I wonder

574
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.500
what you think about this?
The lizard brain, my lizard

575
00:28:57.500 --> 00:29:00.950
brain knows you are not
here. We are having a

576
00:29:00.950 --> 00:29:05.270
conversation on a podcast, over
a collaborative technology, but you

577
00:29:05.270 --> 00:29:07.550
can't see me just stimulating
with my hands. You can't

578
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:11.300
see me nodding. The linguistic
back channel is limited to

579
00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:16.220
me going, when, if you
were here, we would be

580
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:18.470
vibing because I'd be like,
Oh yeah, you see my

581
00:29:18.470 --> 00:29:22.780
eyes and that's not here.
And on teams, it's, it's

582
00:29:22.790 --> 00:29:26.240
two dimensional and it's not
normal to look at nine

583
00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:28.610
people at a time on
a screen. That's not how

584
00:29:28.610 --> 00:29:30.650
people lay at, sit out
on a, on a desk

585
00:29:30.950 --> 00:29:33.560
and it's not comfortable, you
know, to talk to yourself

586
00:29:33.560 --> 00:29:36.020
in a room. The lizard
brain knows. I'm talking to

587
00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.810
myself right now in a
room Because listen to brain,

588
00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.440
this was getting me blizzard
brain. Because the wrong thing

589
00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:44.110
to say, I mean, It's
like the part of the

590
00:29:44.110 --> 00:29:46.720
brain that's not conscious makes
like, you know, when you

591
00:29:46.720 --> 00:29:48.190
get out of an airplane
and you're like tired and

592
00:29:48.190 --> 00:29:49.270
you're like, I don't know
why I'm tired. I just

593
00:29:49.270 --> 00:29:53.730
sat the whole time. The
body knows. Yes. Yes. I

594
00:29:53.730 --> 00:29:56.220
mean, there's also aspects of
that that are draining, right?

595
00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.860
I mean, you were talking
about, it's just not just

596
00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.780
from, at work. This is
the remote work during a

597
00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:04.860
pandemic, there is a crisis
happening. So what this means

598
00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:07.980
is that what's happening outside
of your work is always

599
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:10.950
been important, right? Your work
life balance or what's happening

600
00:30:10.950 --> 00:30:16.110
with your life, always been
important right now, Eating better

601
00:30:16.110 --> 00:30:18.390
upstairs just right now. Sorry
if that came through the

602
00:30:18.390 --> 00:30:22.560
microphone, but someone is just
body slam someone else. Sorry.

603
00:30:22.560 --> 00:30:25.710
I used to live WWE
for what we're talking about.

604
00:30:25.710 --> 00:30:28.710
The pandemic that is a
crisis happening upstairs and needed

605
00:30:28.710 --> 00:30:32.430
to go. I need to
pick the broom now and

606
00:30:32.430 --> 00:30:38.550
like make the broom handle
and pound It's a crisis

607
00:30:38.550 --> 00:30:40.920
happening. And your mind knows
that every time you close

608
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:43.740
the computer and walk over
to, to use the restroom,

609
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.490
you're like, this is not
the usual hallway. I used

610
00:30:47.490 --> 00:30:50.160
to walk down after work
to get a break, right?

611
00:30:50.370 --> 00:30:52.980
You don't. So you don't
get in the car to

612
00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.020
go or the get on
the bus or however you

613
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.840
commute to work, which sometimes
is your signal that you

614
00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:02.290
have completed. The end of
Workday, right? Boundary is, is

615
00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:04.770
blurred and is unclear. And
people are coming up with

616
00:31:04.770 --> 00:31:07.770
their own rhythms and cadences
to figure out how to

617
00:31:07.830 --> 00:31:11.100
show the end of the
Workday or to make themselves

618
00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:13.710
feel like they've ended the
Workday comb with their new

619
00:31:13.710 --> 00:31:17.200
establishment of norms. But it
looks different for everyone. And

620
00:31:17.200 --> 00:31:20.370
I, and it's an ongoing
challenge. That is a huge

621
00:31:20.370 --> 00:31:22.980
problem right now. If I,
if I stick my head

622
00:31:22.980 --> 00:31:26.310
out the door or use
the restroom, Oh, you're done.

623
00:31:26.310 --> 00:31:28.380
You're done working. No, I
just, I just need to

624
00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:30.210
use the restroom. It would
be better if they didn't

625
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:33.240
see me because daddy's here,
he's in the house somewhere.

626
00:31:33.240 --> 00:31:35.670
He wants to hang out
with us. Right. And it

627
00:31:35.670 --> 00:31:37.890
just, it all makes you
feel bad. Yeah. But also,

628
00:31:37.890 --> 00:31:39.810
I think there's also advantages
to being close to your

629
00:31:39.810 --> 00:31:42.240
family now. Right? You have
maybe there's moments. You can

630
00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:45.210
help them with their homework
now, or you get to

631
00:31:45.210 --> 00:31:48.000
help them with different playing
baseball or something in the

632
00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:50.610
backyard. Right. So there's the
advantage of that family proximity

633
00:31:50.610 --> 00:31:53.130
as well. And then the
disadvantages where it feels like,

634
00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:55.320
well, am I giving them
enough attention? Like I'm here,

635
00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:59.040
but I am not physically
here with them or helping

636
00:31:59.040 --> 00:32:01.770
them. So yeah, there's a
lot to consider here too.

637
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:03.690
It is. There's a lot
to consider and I really

638
00:32:03.690 --> 00:32:06.450
appreciate you chatting with me
