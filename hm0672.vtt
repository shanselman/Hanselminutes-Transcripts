This is Scott Hanselman, this

10
00:00:50.180 --> 00:00:53.180
Hansel minutes. And today I'm
talking with Sarah Cooper. She's the

11
00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:56.510
bestselling author of the cow
to be successful without hurting

12
00:00:56.510 --> 00:01:00.170
men's feelings, nonthreatening leadership strategies
for women. And she is

13
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:03.890
the author of the Cooper
review, the most important internet

14
00:01:03.890 --> 00:01:08.600
website in the world@thecooperreview.com. That
is a fact statement of

15
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.930
fact. That is correct. And
you must say internet website.

16
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:15.020
Yeah, that's very important. Oh,
I apologize. The most important

17
00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:19.760
internet website in the world.
Yes. I started following you

18
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.640
on Twitter. When you, you
went viral a couple of

19
00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:25.250
years back when you wrote
about a hundred tricks to

20
00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:27.920
appear smart in meetings, how
did, how did that book

21
00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:29.720
happen? Did you just have
an idea, like did a

22
00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.430
tweet go viral and that
turned into a book and

23
00:01:31.430 --> 00:01:34.790
that turned into, Oh, it's
a long, long story that

24
00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:41.150
began in a meeting at
Yahoo somewhere around 2007 or

25
00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:45.260
eight or so I was
sitting in a meeting and

26
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.950
a product manager got up
from the table and drew

27
00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:52.190
a Venn diagram on the
whiteboard. And it was the

28
00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:55.460
most ridiculous Venn diagram I'd
ever seen. It made no

29
00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:57.200
sense. It had nothing to
do with what we were

30
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.540
talking about. It didn't help
the conversation at all. And

31
00:01:59.540 --> 00:02:01.010
I thought, for sure, people
are going to be like,

32
00:02:01.010 --> 00:02:05.090
dude, sit down. This is
irrelevant and not helpful. But

33
00:02:05.180 --> 00:02:09.890
instead everyone started helping him
draw the Venn diagram and

34
00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:13.520
telling him what to label
the circles. And I was

35
00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:16.070
really impressed because he just
handed the marker to someone

36
00:02:16.070 --> 00:02:18.320
else and he sat back
at his desk and went

37
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:20.990
back to playing on his
laptop. And so I wrote

38
00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:23.090
in my notebook how to
look smart in a meeting,

39
00:02:23.210 --> 00:02:25.610
draw a Venn diagram. I
just, I wrote that in

40
00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:28.430
my notebook. And then a
week later, I think I

41
00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:31.100
was in a different meeting,
maybe same product manager and

42
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:35.480
somebody was giving a presentation
and they said, so 25%

43
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.200
of people clicked on this
button. And someone said, Oh,

44
00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:42.890
so about one in four.
And I was really happened.

45
00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.410
Like this really happened and
I was blown away. I

46
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:47.990
was like, Whoa. Cause everybody
was like, Oh yeah, that's

47
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.330
such a, it really crystallizes
it. When you say it,

48
00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:52.760
you know, in one, in
four that's so much clearer

49
00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.550
than 25%. And so I
wrote down on the same

50
00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:57.920
piece of paper, you know,
how to look smart in

51
00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:01.750
a meeting, translate into fractions.
And I put that notebook

52
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:04.750
away for years and years
and years. And then when

53
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:07.180
I was working at Google,
I moved in with my

54
00:03:07.390 --> 00:03:10.570
boyfriend at the time now
husband and I came across

55
00:03:10.570 --> 00:03:13.030
the notebook again. And I
was like, Oh, I have

56
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.670
so many more tricks now
because I've been working at

57
00:03:15.670 --> 00:03:18.310
Google for three years. And
so I finished the list

58
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.670
and I just posted it
on medium.com and it was

59
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:23.530
10 tricks to appear smart
in meetings. And it went

60
00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:26.110
completely viral. It had like
a million views within a

61
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.610
week and it kind of
started from there. You know,

62
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:32.070
that thing that people say
on the internet when something

63
00:03:32.070 --> 00:03:34.320
is both funny, but also
a problem. And you go,

64
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.100
Oh, I feel personally attacked.
Like I want to laugh

65
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:41.640
at all of this, but
it is deeply painful because

66
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:45.270
I have been in meetings
personally and non ironically said,

67
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.070
Hey, can we just take
a step back? What problem

68
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.830
are we really trying to
solve here? But I don't

69
00:03:49.830 --> 00:03:52.800
feel like I'm full of
crap when I'm saying it.

70
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:55.260
Yeah. I mean, and I've
been in meetings where I've

71
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:58.290
been nodding and looking like
I was taking notes and

72
00:03:58.290 --> 00:03:59.790
then I looked back at
my notes and they didn't

73
00:03:59.790 --> 00:04:02.100
make any sense, but I
was, I'm sure I looked

74
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.010
very engaged. I mean, we
all, we all do these

75
00:04:05.010 --> 00:04:07.290
things, you know, like I
did the pacing around the

76
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.450
room thing to look like
I was, you know, taking

77
00:04:09.450 --> 00:04:13.290
it all in and really
considering everything. But I think

78
00:04:13.290 --> 00:04:15.780
it's just like part of
that corporate culture. We are

79
00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:17.550
all sort of putting on
a little bit of a

80
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:21.450
show for everyone else. You
know, even if we don't

81
00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:25.500
realize it, we're imitating each
other in different ways. And

82
00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.160
we all, as a team,
as a company have, you

83
00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.040
know, our jargon and our
shorthand and our ways of,

84
00:04:32.090 --> 00:04:34.080
of looking like we know
what we're talking about. And

85
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.300
we all are aware of
those things subconsciously and we

86
00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:38.970
just kind of do them.
I wonder, is it, is

87
00:04:38.970 --> 00:04:41.580
it corporate culture or is
it human culture? Like tell

88
00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:43.530
me that it's not that
we've done this to ourselves.

89
00:04:43.530 --> 00:04:47.160
Like if you're Dutch and
you're like in Holland speaking

90
00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:49.350
Dutch, are they doing the
exact same thing? Have you

91
00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:52.950
done any like international? Does
this translate to every company

92
00:04:52.950 --> 00:04:55.110
or is this like America
A hundred tricks to appear

93
00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:57.960
smart in meetings has been
translated in 11 or 12

94
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:03.270
different languages. Yes, it is
especially popular in Japan. I

95
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:05.490
have no idea if they
realize this is a joke.

96
00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:08.640
Or if they think that
this is a cultural exploration,

97
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:12.090
that is a documentary that
helps you understand American culture.

98
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:15.600
But yeah, I haven't gotten
any residuals yet, except from

99
00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:18.780
Japan. That's the only place
where this has made that

100
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:22.050
money. So We need to
go to Japan because if

101
00:05:22.080 --> 00:05:27.210
there are people very well
intentioned, very kind salary, people

102
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.670
in Japan who have like,
Oh, tricks to appear smart

103
00:05:29.670 --> 00:05:32.910
in meetings, I need to
buy that Right away. Yeah.

104
00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:36.090
Yeah. I mean, it's really
sad because I, I, you

105
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:38.490
know, I track, you know,
how people find my website

106
00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:41.940
and sometimes the keywords are,
how do I look smart

107
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.280
in a meeting? And I
think these are people earnestly

108
00:05:44.430 --> 00:05:46.920
looking for help on how
to look smart in a

109
00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.730
meeting and they're finding my
tricks. And so I might

110
00:05:50.730 --> 00:05:53.290
actually be making this worse
and I do apologize. It's

111
00:05:53.290 --> 00:05:55.890
become, yeah, this is a
culture that's problematic. And you

112
00:05:55.890 --> 00:05:59.330
have just made it worse
for, because my wife, who

113
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:01.640
is a nurse is now
starting to say, will this

114
00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.610
scale as a way of
telling me that I'm full

115
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:07.900
of crap. Well, that's good.
That's good. That's good. Oh

116
00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.750
yeah. It's totally like, you
know, the one child is

117
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:13.180
going to go to basketball
and one, child's going to

118
00:06:13.180 --> 00:06:15.220
go to baseball and it's
like, okay, will this scale?

119
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:16.570
I was like, Oh my
God, is that what it

120
00:06:16.570 --> 00:06:19.150
is? My sister is a
nurse. And she said that

121
00:06:19.150 --> 00:06:21.340
someone said, KA asked the
presenter to go back a

122
00:06:21.340 --> 00:06:23.050
slide in a meeting. And
so like, I feel like

123
00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:26.320
that happens all the time.
Probably It's, it's a problem.

124
00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:29.650
Do you, you used to
work at Google, right. And

125
00:06:29.650 --> 00:06:31.420
you worked at, you said
you had Yahoo before that.

126
00:06:31.420 --> 00:06:34.570
So how many years did
you spend in tech? Total?

127
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:41.440
About 10. Yeah. Okay. Now,
but you're outside of tech

128
00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:45.770
now, but you're still like
bitingly, like cutting into our,

129
00:06:45.930 --> 00:06:48.400
our culture with, with an
eye as if you are

130
00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:51.610
standing over my shoulder in
these meetings. Is it hard

131
00:06:51.610 --> 00:06:55.570
to, to make humor and
books and jokes about tech,

132
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.310
if you're out of tech
for a couple of years,

133
00:06:57.310 --> 00:06:59.140
or do you, how do
you get your material now?

134
00:06:59.470 --> 00:07:01.960
It is, it's a lot
harder. I mean, the thing

135
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:05.410
that I, when I left
Google and what I really

136
00:07:05.410 --> 00:07:09.250
enjoy about comedy and writing
is that it grows as

137
00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:11.620
you grow. So as your
life changes and becomes something

138
00:07:11.620 --> 00:07:15.100
else than your, what you're
writing about becomes something else

139
00:07:15.100 --> 00:07:17.950
too. So it just reflects
that. And so it is

140
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.040
harder to like, it's not
my day to day anymore

141
00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:24.400
to come up with a
lot of this stuff. I

142
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:29.230
probably will write less about
this going forward and write

143
00:07:29.230 --> 00:07:32.260
more about other things that
I'm observing, but there's different

144
00:07:32.260 --> 00:07:35.080
things that sort of spark
it. Like, you know, I

145
00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.270
was at Google today, just
having lunch with an old

146
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:40.330
friend there and just being
in that environment, you know,

147
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.910
just brought up a lot
of memories of things that

148
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.720
people would do. The security.
I just remember the security

149
00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:49.000
guard at Google takes his
job very, very seriously. And

150
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.640
that's just the security guard,
you know, like he's, he's

151
00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:54.280
just guarding the Gates going
in, but he was very,

152
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:57.250
very, you know, taking it
his job very seriously. And

153
00:07:57.250 --> 00:07:58.930
so I thought that was
just, and I love making

154
00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:02.620
the, those observations. I'm always
just sort of thinking outside

155
00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:05.020
of myself, like what's going
on and not really listening

156
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.060
to what's being said, but
like more like how it's

157
00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:10.270
being said or how people
are acting. And that's just

158
00:08:10.270 --> 00:08:13.210
how I wasn't meetings. So
much of your, your comedy

159
00:08:13.210 --> 00:08:16.510
is this it's funny. Cause
it's true. But also it

160
00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:19.630
kind of, it hurts. It
hurts. You have this wonderful.

161
00:08:19.990 --> 00:08:21.430
I don't know. I assume
it's a real quote, but

162
00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:24.310
it's a quote on how
to be successful without hurting

163
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:26.500
men's feelings where it says,
Oh, I only got through

164
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.500
the table of contents. It
just hurt too much, man.

165
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.410
Yeah. It's it does feel
like that sometimes. I mean,

166
00:08:32.410 --> 00:08:34.000
I'm reading all of this
and it's just like, Oh

167
00:08:34.480 --> 00:08:38.200
yeah. Oh gosh. You know,
it's funny. Cause it's Yeah,

168
00:08:38.560 --> 00:08:40.690
that's what I get. People
are like, this is funny,

169
00:08:40.690 --> 00:08:43.240
but it also makes me
want to cry or throw

170
00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:46.720
the book across the room
or punch someone or punch

171
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.990
myself or scream into a
pillow. And it's something that

172
00:08:49.990 --> 00:08:53.260
I do struggle with because
I think for me, it's

173
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.680
a little bit of an
outlet to say things that

174
00:08:55.680 --> 00:08:58.320
I want to say, but
in a way that is

175
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:04.200
satirical and tongue in cheek,
but honest. So sometimes it's

176
00:09:04.200 --> 00:09:07.500
just not funny. Sometimes, sometimes
it's just pisses you off

177
00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:10.880
and that's something I need
to work on. Well, I

178
00:09:10.880 --> 00:09:12.200
don't think, I don't say
that in any way as

179
00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:14.540
a criticism, what I'm actually
thinking is how did, do

180
00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.070
you feel like you're shining
a bright light on, on

181
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:23.420
things, whether it be issues
around, around feminism and tech

182
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:25.850
or whether it be issues
around really being allowed to

183
00:09:25.850 --> 00:09:27.560
be in a meeting or
all these things, there are

184
00:09:27.560 --> 00:09:30.020
opportunities for us to change
and become better at and

185
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:31.730
laugh about it while we're
doing it. Yeah. I mean,

186
00:09:31.730 --> 00:09:33.650
and that, I mean, a
few years ago I wrote,

187
00:09:33.680 --> 00:09:37.670
I got someone who wrote
to me who said that

188
00:09:37.670 --> 00:09:41.660
they read my a hundred
tricks and they noticed that

189
00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:44.360
they did some of these
things just kind of robotically

190
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:47.990
and it actually made it
so that they weren't present

191
00:09:48.140 --> 00:09:50.000
in the room because they
were just sort of doing

192
00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.780
this sort of performance and
not really paying attention. And

193
00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:55.520
so they said to themselves,
you know what, I think

194
00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:57.110
I'm going to stop doing
this. Or I think I'm

195
00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:58.790
going to like be more
aware of when I'm just

196
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:01.310
kind of knee jerk doing
something. That's not actually helping

197
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.860
me understand what's going on.
And that was the first

198
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:05.690
time that I was like,
Oh, I guess I am

199
00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.720
sort of teaching people in
a sort of weird way.

200
00:10:08.990 --> 00:10:11.540
It just makes people aware
a little bit more aware.

201
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:13.370
And you're like, knowing is
half the battle. And so

202
00:10:13.370 --> 00:10:15.200
like, you can be a
little bit more aware and

203
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:16.730
then maybe you can change
things, but you don't have

204
00:10:16.730 --> 00:10:18.230
to, and I'm not telling
you to change. But if

205
00:10:18.230 --> 00:10:21.590
you want to, you can.
That's very cool. I'm looking

206
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:24.170
on a, on Amazon too,
are you at your new

207
00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:26.690
book? How to be successful
without hurting men's feelings. And

208
00:10:26.690 --> 00:10:28.460
I'm going to include links
to your website in the

209
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:31.280
show notes, and everyone should
check this out. But rather

210
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.920
than looking at the five
star four and a half

211
00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:37.010
star, highly rated book, like
to be clear, this is

212
00:10:37.010 --> 00:10:39.920
a best seller, but why
not look at the one

213
00:10:39.920 --> 00:10:43.280
stars I'm scrolling down. The
one stars here. This is

214
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:50.150
fantastic. Completely misleading. One star
women should do the opposite

215
00:10:50.150 --> 00:10:51.770
of what this book is
telling them. The author is

216
00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:55.430
a comedian. Maybe this book
is just a joke. Who

217
00:10:55.430 --> 00:11:00.080
knows? Could the humor a
title maybe have given you

218
00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:02.720
some insight into whether this
was a joke? I don't

219
00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:05.660
know. I don't know The
best part is that people

220
00:11:05.690 --> 00:11:08.300
are trying to explain to
the one star person in

221
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.460
the comments. So there's like
a thread now. I didn't

222
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.880
know that. Oh yeah. With
bulleted lists bullet. Yes. The

223
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:18.680
book is humor. Yes. Thank
you for your opinion, bro.

224
00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:23.060
One 82. I'm starting to
suspect that this must, this

225
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:25.370
can't be real. This must
be you and your friends

226
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:28.100
in the comments because no
one could be this dense.

227
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:32.900
Oh, but they are. They
really are. I before the

228
00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:35.930
book even came out, I
got someone who wrote me

229
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.990
an email letting me know
that they would not be

230
00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:42.620
reading my book and why
that's valuable. Yeah. I know.

231
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:46.040
I thought it was very,
very helpful. The subject was

232
00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:50.000
blatant sexism and it, the
message said, I won't be

233
00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:52.550
buying your, how to be
successful without hurting men's feelings.

234
00:11:52.550 --> 00:11:54.880
If I wrote book called
how to be successful without

235
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.640
hurting women's feelings, no publisher
would touch it. And I

236
00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.920
would be lambasted for writing
it in the first place.

237
00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.280
Even when calling it satire.
What appalls me the most

238
00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:05.380
is not that you wrote
it, but that most men

239
00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:08.800
will ignore the blatant sexism.
Uncomfortably, laugh it off and

240
00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:12.190
pretend it doesn't hurt because
that is somehow more manly.

241
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:14.380
But I'm man enough to
call you out on it.

242
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.720
Sarah Cooper, The idea that that's
a valuable use of someone's

243
00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:22.980
keystrokes. Like I talk about
productivity and like being a

244
00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:26.010
productive, productive person. And you
have a finite number of

245
00:12:26.010 --> 00:12:29.760
keystrokes left in your hands.
Like before you die, that

246
00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:33.090
person just gave you the
gift of 2000 of their

247
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:35.460
wasted keystrokes. Like do they
honestly think you're going to

248
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:37.350
care? I guess we're talking
about on a podcast. So

249
00:12:37.980 --> 00:12:40.920
that's good for them. Kudos
Love the lack of self

250
00:12:40.920 --> 00:12:45.000
awareness of, of men having
to uncomfortably laugh off blatant

251
00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:50.220
sexism, women uncomfortably laugh off
blatant sexism all the time.

252
00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:53.610
That's we, the uncomfortable laugh
we invented the uncomfortable laugh.

253
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:57.360
That's our thing. So I
just thought that that was

254
00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:01.320
kind of, yeah. Yeah. The,
the I'm looking at your,

255
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.110
I assume this came out
before the book nine nonthreatening

256
00:13:04.110 --> 00:13:06.810
leadership strategies for women on
your blog. Yeah. It's a

257
00:13:06.810 --> 00:13:09.000
lot if I'm not sure
I'm not an English major,

258
00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:12.180
but this feels like passive
voice. Like you take a

259
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:16.080
normal, straightforward thing that someone
would say that I would

260
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:18.210
assume anyone should be able
to say, this has to

261
00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:21.000
be done by Monday. And
then you just add a

262
00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.070
lot of fluff around it
to make it nonthreatening. What

263
00:13:23.070 --> 00:13:25.770
do you think about maybe
getting this done by Monday?

264
00:13:26.580 --> 00:13:29.400
That would be, that would
be bad writing. Yeah. It

265
00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:33.360
was good enough office space
though. The boss had office

266
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.850
space, I guess kind of
talked like that a little

267
00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:38.850
bit. Yeah. Yeah. What do
you think about coming in

268
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:44.760
on Saturday? Yeah, I mean,
I think that, you know,

269
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.360
it's, it's actually just how
I would sort of change

270
00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:51.990
how I talked sometimes in
order to be more approachable

271
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:56.040
when I became a manager
and I noticed it a

272
00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:59.940
lot too, when I managed
women who were very headstrong

273
00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:02.670
and passionate and had a
lot of ideas that people

274
00:14:02.670 --> 00:14:04.740
would complain to me about
them in a way that

275
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.200
I know that they wouldn't
complain about a guy who

276
00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:10.740
was just as passionate and
excited. So this all came

277
00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:16.260
from yeah, very true experience.
Yeah. I'm trying to, I'm

278
00:14:16.260 --> 00:14:19.380
a somewhat new manager and
I have two men and

279
00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.300
two women that work for
me. And I am trying

280
00:14:21.300 --> 00:14:24.810
to consciously think about how
I interact with them. And

281
00:14:24.810 --> 00:14:28.290
I do often hear from,
from the women and sometimes

282
00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:30.540
from the men that they
are, they don't want someone

283
00:14:30.540 --> 00:14:33.690
to send feedback that they're
being pushy. Right. Nobody wants

284
00:14:33.690 --> 00:14:37.410
to be pushy. Right. And
it's interesting how in our

285
00:14:37.410 --> 00:14:41.760
culture, somehow saying matter of
fact, straightforward things like I

286
00:14:41.760 --> 00:14:45.090
have an idea could be
thought by any, by any

287
00:14:45.090 --> 00:14:49.620
gender as being threatened, right?
Yeah. You know, and I,

288
00:14:49.620 --> 00:14:52.550
as a Portlander, I'm from
Portland, which is basically Canada.

289
00:14:53.720 --> 00:14:57.050
When I interact with new
Yorkers, I'm finding myself being

290
00:14:57.200 --> 00:14:59.180
passive as well. And I
wouldn't say I have an

291
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.340
idea. I'd be like, I'm
kinda just thinking out loud

292
00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.700
here, just spit balling, brainstorming.
When did, when did I

293
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:09.100
become so passive, Maybe somebody
hurt you. Maybe, you know,

294
00:15:09.290 --> 00:15:15.160
who, who hurts you, maybe
you got some feedback, Negative

295
00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.410
feedback. What made you think
that you needed to be

296
00:15:17.410 --> 00:15:20.320
nicer? Maybe you're just a
people pleaser. Maybe you want

297
00:15:20.440 --> 00:15:23.380
people to like you. And
so you're doing things like

298
00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:26.260
this. I mean, do you
use a lot of exclamation

299
00:15:26.260 --> 00:15:29.860
points and smiley faces in
your emails? Yeah. It's all

300
00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:31.720
hearts and Winky faces. I
don't know. I'm not good

301
00:15:31.720 --> 00:15:37.120
at emojis. I don't speak
emoji. I'm doing it very

302
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.780
wrong, but it's interesting because
what's happening is women are

303
00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:44.050
being taught or ingrained or
the culture is such that

304
00:15:44.110 --> 00:15:46.870
they're, they're feeling that they
need to have these nonthreatening

305
00:15:46.900 --> 00:15:49.180
things. And then you play
that tape over and over

306
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:51.040
in your head and then
it's baked into your persona.

307
00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.140
You have to work to
undo it. Yeah. You have

308
00:15:53.140 --> 00:15:55.870
to work really, really hard
to undo it. And I

309
00:15:55.870 --> 00:15:58.390
think that like mentorship is
good. I think women mentoring

310
00:15:58.450 --> 00:16:01.450
other like younger women helps
a lot in that situation.

311
00:16:01.450 --> 00:16:04.510
But if a woman who
has gotten as far as

312
00:16:04.510 --> 00:16:07.750
she's gotten to become a
mentor got there, because she

313
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:10.330
was able to tone her
voice down, then she's just

314
00:16:10.390 --> 00:16:13.120
switching that to the people
that she's mentoring as well.

315
00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:14.800
So it can be a
thing that kind of just

316
00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:17.920
doesn't go away. Although I,
I feel like it is,

317
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:20.140
it is going to go
away just as, as more

318
00:16:20.140 --> 00:16:23.710
women join the workforce and
become more visible and become

319
00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.670
like are comfortable being themselves.
Then it's like, Oh, she's

320
00:16:28.270 --> 00:16:31.480
angry, bitchy woman. It's just
like, no, she's pissed off

321
00:16:31.510 --> 00:16:33.580
that guy's pissed off. She's
pissed off. No big deal.

322
00:16:33.580 --> 00:16:36.670
Kind of like being okay
with emotion in general in

323
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.610
the office. Yeah. I think
that's a really good point.

324
00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:44.590
But ultimately, well, the office
is overwhelmingly male. The problem

325
00:16:44.590 --> 00:16:47.440
lies in, in my lab,
not in anyone's, you know,

326
00:16:47.770 --> 00:16:51.940
certainly great. If someone can
modulate their, their tone and

327
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:53.710
just try to be straightforward,
but I need to not

328
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:55.840
take it as, as being
threatening any way. Like a

329
00:16:55.840 --> 00:16:59.710
simple statement, like have this
report done by Thursday is

330
00:16:59.710 --> 00:17:02.800
literally just what it is.
There's nothing underneath that. Right.

331
00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.760
But everybody is so sensitive
to tone. And I think

332
00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:09.970
they're even more sensitive when
women are speaking. And so,

333
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.580
and that's why women get
called out more on like

334
00:17:12.790 --> 00:17:17.860
their tone or how they're
coming across. And I don't

335
00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:20.620
know. I think that's, it,
it does get exacerbated in

336
00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:25.300
the corporate world. Cause everybody's
so passive aggressive sometimes. Yeah.

337
00:17:25.330 --> 00:17:29.170
That's so challenging because the
Slack back channel in the

338
00:17:29.170 --> 00:17:33.850
meeting, it's like virtually rolling
your eyes around the person

339
00:17:33.850 --> 00:17:37.390
that's talking right now, Google,
we had a weekly meeting.

340
00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.740
Company-wide weekly meeting. And while
the meeting was going on,

341
00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:44.110
like literally Larry and Sergei
would be talking, there'd be

342
00:17:44.110 --> 00:17:47.710
like a live stream of
memes being made. That would

343
00:17:47.710 --> 00:17:50.100
be making fun of what
they were about in real

344
00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:53.880
time. So like that's, that
was like the culture, which

345
00:17:53.880 --> 00:17:56.100
I loved because like nothing
was sacred. They would make

346
00:17:56.100 --> 00:17:59.310
fun of literally anything or
anyone. And I thought it

347
00:17:59.310 --> 00:18:05.990
was great. Hey folks, you're
a very good developer. Probably

348
00:18:06.410 --> 00:18:09.680
regardless. You do write bugs.
That's unavoidable. What is affordable

349
00:18:09.680 --> 00:18:12.080
is wasting time trying to
track down the cause of

350
00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.700
those bugs century.io provides full
stack error tracking that lets

351
00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:19.760
you monitor and fix problems.
In real time, you can

352
00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.280
see the severity and the
scope of the error get

immediate access to the stack,
trace, connect the problem to

354
00:18:25.370 --> 00:18:28.130
the commit that caused it
and fix it without delay

355
00:18:28.400 --> 00:18:31.160
century to name so common
that they have to include

356
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.260
the top level domain in
their advertising to make sure

357
00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:39.920
you remember it. century.io, that's

it together. Visit century.io. So

362
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:58.730
I'm looking@thecooperreview.com, whichever one needs
to immediately go and check

363
00:18:58.730 --> 00:19:01.880
out and bookmark who is
drawing all the art. Is

364
00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:04.040
this all you? So this
is me, but it's, it's

365
00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:07.520
a hack I wanted to
draw because I love, we

366
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:09.620
were talking about the oatmeal
before I love the oatmeal.

367
00:19:09.620 --> 00:19:13.280
And so I want it
to turn 10 tricks into

368
00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.750
an illustrated post. It was
all text at first. And

369
00:19:17.750 --> 00:19:20.840
so I couldn't figure out
how to freehand draw. And

370
00:19:20.840 --> 00:19:23.450
so finally I just got
this like cheesy stock photo

371
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.870
and I traced it and
I just went with that

372
00:19:26.870 --> 00:19:29.360
because it was kind of
like necessity to just get

373
00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:32.510
it done. And it just
worked because it's just really

374
00:19:32.510 --> 00:19:35.240
cheesy, these cheesy stock photos
and these cheesy sort of

375
00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:38.750
like illustrations kind of went
together. So all of these

376
00:19:38.750 --> 00:19:43.910
are basically just tracings of
photos. Really? That that's really

377
00:19:43.910 --> 00:19:48.140
cool. Like not to overcomplicate,
I guess I'm over complimenting,

378
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.350
but that's, you've developed your
own art style because it's

379
00:19:51.350 --> 00:19:55.700
your tracing of the stock
photos. That's really, really creative.

380
00:19:56.240 --> 00:19:57.980
Yeah. And in the, in
the first book, a hundred

381
00:19:57.980 --> 00:20:00.380
tricks, I basically just got
my husband and two friends

382
00:20:00.380 --> 00:20:02.270
to pretend to be in
meetings. And then I took

383
00:20:02.270 --> 00:20:05.090
pictures of them and then
I traced them. So those

384
00:20:05.090 --> 00:20:08.270
are all my, my, my
husband and my two friends.

385
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:14.030
That's awesome. That's awesome. So
here's a dumb question, but

386
00:20:14.030 --> 00:20:16.490
you were in tech for
10 years or Google, you

387
00:20:16.490 --> 00:20:18.350
worked at, you know, you,
you could still be in

388
00:20:18.350 --> 00:20:22.730
tech, you could get that
tech money. Why would you

389
00:20:22.730 --> 00:20:26.990
quit your job to be
a comedian? Because from everything

390
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:29.720
I know about comedians, I
learned from ms. Maizel, they

391
00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:33.380
don't have any money. Right.
And they suffer many, not

392
00:20:33.390 --> 00:20:36.210
she she's successful, but no
one else is. Yeah. I

393
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.660
just wrote about her because
it pisses me off how

394
00:20:38.690 --> 00:20:41.990
easy her comedy career has
been so far. Yeah. You

395
00:20:41.990 --> 00:20:43.790
just show up and get
really drunk and then you

396
00:20:43.790 --> 00:20:46.850
were funny and everyone, yeah.
Someone famous opens for you.

397
00:20:46.850 --> 00:20:49.060
You need to write anything
Cause you just make it

398
00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:51.370
all up on the spot
and it's immediately funny and

399
00:20:51.370 --> 00:20:53.500
that's just what you do
every night. And it just

400
00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:58.180
is so easy. Yeah. It's
it's it wasn't a good

401
00:20:58.180 --> 00:21:01.600
choice. I gotta, I gotta
say it was not smart.

402
00:21:01.690 --> 00:21:03.850
I, it was hard to
leave Google, you know? Cause

403
00:21:03.850 --> 00:21:05.770
it's like, if you can't
be happy at the best

404
00:21:05.770 --> 00:21:07.240
company in the world, then
you're just never going to

405
00:21:07.240 --> 00:21:09.280
be happy. That's that was
kind of what I was

406
00:21:09.280 --> 00:21:15.300
thinking to myself, but I,
Immedion's not happy. Like I

407
00:21:15.300 --> 00:21:18.570
did, I did full, full
disclosure. I did stand up

408
00:21:19.140 --> 00:21:22.320
20 years ago, very badly
open mics and stuff like

409
00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:25.170
that. Now I just do
it with PowerPoint at work,

410
00:21:25.650 --> 00:21:28.110
but I have, but I
have healthcare, which is exciting.

411
00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:31.350
When you say like, if
you can't be happy, like

412
00:21:31.590 --> 00:21:33.750
is, is this one of
those, all comedy comes from

413
00:21:33.750 --> 00:21:36.690
pain kind of things. Yeah.
Maybe you're right. I didn't

414
00:21:36.690 --> 00:21:40.440
think about it that way.
Maybe I punished myself as

415
00:21:40.530 --> 00:21:42.570
to suffer for my art.
Maybe that was part of

416
00:21:42.570 --> 00:21:46.110
it. I just really was
excited about writing and making

417
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:48.870
people laugh. And 10 tricks
was the first time I

418
00:21:48.870 --> 00:21:52.770
had put like my corporate
experience with my love for

419
00:21:52.770 --> 00:21:54.660
comedy. And I put those
two things together and it

420
00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:58.050
really worked and it really
resonated with people. And so

421
00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:00.210
I just, I just decided
to give it a shot.

422
00:22:00.210 --> 00:22:02.070
And my boss was like,
if you want to come

423
00:22:02.070 --> 00:22:03.870
back, you can always come
back. And so it seemed

424
00:22:03.870 --> 00:22:05.790
like a bigger risk to
not give it a shot

425
00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:08.790
than to give it a
shot. Okay. That's awesome. That

426
00:22:08.790 --> 00:22:11.790
sounds like a very successful,
a very kind, assuming a

427
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:14.910
very supportive boss. He was
yeah, very, very supportive. Everybody

428
00:22:14.910 --> 00:22:17.490
was super supportive of, of
me doing this. And I

429
00:22:17.490 --> 00:22:20.010
was, you know, I was
having panic attacks and I

430
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.640
was stressed out for years.
I mean, it, it took

431
00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.530
a few years before I
was really like, okay, I'm

432
00:22:25.530 --> 00:22:27.240
not going to go back
to Google. But for that

433
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:29.100
first year it was like,
I could still go back,

434
00:22:29.130 --> 00:22:30.600
I guess, still go back.
You know, it was in

435
00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:34.110
the back of my head
Is comedy now different because

436
00:22:34.110 --> 00:22:35.700
you can have your own
website, you can have your

437
00:22:35.700 --> 00:22:38.250
own videos. You can go
viral. Like how much of

438
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.410
it is still. You have
to be seen by someone

439
00:22:40.410 --> 00:22:42.750
famous who then introduces you
to an agent, et cetera,

440
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:46.140
et cetera, versus you can
bootstrap this entirely yourself, just

441
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.090
put up a word press
and a YouTube. And now

442
00:22:48.090 --> 00:22:51.810
you're a working comedian. Yeah.
I think you've nailed it.

443
00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.510
I mean, there's so many
people who don't wait for

444
00:22:54.510 --> 00:22:57.570
someone to say, let me
publish you. Or, you know,

445
00:22:57.570 --> 00:22:59.520
let me put you in
my thing. They make their

446
00:22:59.520 --> 00:23:02.280
own thing. And it's so
much easier now to do

447
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.920
that. You know, I made
the Cooper review. It's just

448
00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.580
like a WordPress plugin while
I was workplace theme with

449
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.120
a lot of WordPress plugins
and a lot of friends,

450
00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:14.940
they submit to places like
the new Yorker and try

451
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.830
to get published, but they
also have, you know, their

452
00:23:16.830 --> 00:23:19.560
own websites and they make
their own series and they

453
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:21.570
make their own videos and
they really put themselves out

454
00:23:21.570 --> 00:23:25.230
there. And it's almost like
if you don't do that,

455
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.660
then you're really not going
to get anywhere. It's almost

456
00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:29.820
like a necessity now to
do be doing things like

457
00:23:29.820 --> 00:23:33.600
that. And does it, does
all of this, the Cooper

458
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.700
review, the books and all
of that, does that all

459
00:23:35.700 --> 00:23:38.280
feed into things like doing
events and going and giving

460
00:23:38.280 --> 00:23:40.680
in and doing actual stand
up and being on like

461
00:23:40.980 --> 00:23:43.170
TV and things like that.
Is that the goal or

462
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:45.260
is the goal just to
express yourself and have, and

463
00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:48.340
get paid in a phone?
Yeah. I mean, I think

464
00:23:48.340 --> 00:23:51.070
the ultimate goal is to
leave everything on the table

465
00:23:51.070 --> 00:23:54.370
in terms of like telling
my story and, and being

466
00:23:54.370 --> 00:23:57.580
honest about who I am,
that's what really excites me

467
00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.490
because I think that I'd
like to inspire other people

468
00:24:00.490 --> 00:24:05.770
to share their stories as
well and make money. Yeah.

469
00:24:05.770 --> 00:24:07.370
I would like to make
money. That would be good

470
00:24:07.390 --> 00:24:11.650
to, and the more I
do, the more I share,

471
00:24:11.710 --> 00:24:15.520
the more things sort of
happen and, and more opportunities

472
00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:19.900
come to do speaking engagements
or to perform or to

473
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:23.710
create things. So it's been
four years since I created

474
00:24:23.710 --> 00:24:26.860
the Cooper review.com and it's
starting to be to a

475
00:24:26.860 --> 00:24:29.710
place where people know me
for a certain thing and

476
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:34.120
are seeking me out. So
yeah, it's just a, it's

477
00:24:34.120 --> 00:24:36.940
a good, it's a good
feeling. It's still like, ah,

478
00:24:36.970 --> 00:24:38.680
what's going on? I don't
know, you know, day to

479
00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:42.190
day what's going to happen,
but it's exciting. I think

480
00:24:42.190 --> 00:24:44.320
one of the things that
is interesting to watch, because

481
00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.720
I followed you immediately when
I saw your first thing

482
00:24:46.720 --> 00:24:50.230
go viral, is that I
can see because I followed

483
00:24:50.230 --> 00:24:53.590
you at the beginning that
it's an overnight success over

484
00:24:53.590 --> 00:24:56.020
a half, a decade of
hard work and late nights,

485
00:24:56.050 --> 00:24:58.390
you know, to someone else,
they may just be watching

486
00:24:58.390 --> 00:25:00.070
and saying, wow, Sarah Cooper came
out of nowhere and she's

487
00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.980
bestselling author. But the grind,
the grind, the grind, the

488
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:07.060
merge, the websites, the branding.
Yeah. It is a lot

489
00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:10.090
of work, but you know,
when you make something and

490
00:25:10.090 --> 00:25:11.770
it's yours, you're just so
proud of it. And you

491
00:25:11.770 --> 00:25:14.950
know, it's all kind of
worth it. Do you go

492
00:25:14.950 --> 00:25:17.170
out and do book tours
now? Or did you self

493
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:21.040
publish the book? It's published
by Andrews McNeil and I

494
00:25:21.130 --> 00:25:25.420
did a few events in
New York and San Francisco. And

495
00:25:25.450 --> 00:25:28.600
now I'm just kind of
doing some talks around the

496
00:25:28.660 --> 00:25:32.680
country, around the world this
year. Some of them having

497
00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:35.380
to do with a book
and some just other like

498
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:39.490
random parodies of, of corporate
and office. Yeah. I've been

499
00:25:39.490 --> 00:25:41.440
checking out the, the YouTube.
I want to make sure

500
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:44.470
that people go to the
Cooper review.com. Certainly it's a

501
00:25:44.470 --> 00:25:48.010
blog. If there was an
RSS reader from Google, then

502
00:25:48.010 --> 00:25:51.340
we could all use that.
But there isn't make sure

503
00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.590
that they subscribe to then
maybe, you know, someone, you

504
00:25:53.590 --> 00:25:57.400
could give them a call
and complain about that. That's

505
00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:02.590
a, that's unfortunate. Wait, what?
There's no Google reader anymore.

506
00:26:02.590 --> 00:26:06.040
It's gone. They did. I
thought you were telling me

507
00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:08.770
there was something missing on
my website. Oh no, your

508
00:26:08.770 --> 00:26:11.560
blog is amazing. I wish
I had a product from

509
00:26:11.560 --> 00:26:13.360
Google to watch or read
it in. Yeah. They shouldn't

510
00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:17.050
have shut that down. I'm
scared. They're getting rid of

511
00:26:17.050 --> 00:26:19.690
inbox. Are you scared about
this? I don't know. They're

512
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:24.070
getting rid of freaking everything.
Good. Yeah. Inbox I think

513
00:26:24.070 --> 00:26:26.560
is either gone or on
the edge of gone. Google

514
00:26:26.560 --> 00:26:29.740
reader is gone Google plus
both of the people over

515
00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:33.940
there are still around, but
they're, they're concerned. Like it

516
00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.040
could be gone at any
minute. I know this that

517
00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:38.650
you've removed Google plus from
your follow the Cooper review

518
00:26:39.250 --> 00:26:44.820
area. Yeah. It's over. It's
over. Yeah. It's A tragedy.

519
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:47.790
Not sure what to do
about that. They do tend

520
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.070
to remove stuff, but you
said you were there today

521
00:26:50.070 --> 00:26:53.840
though. Hanging around. Yeah. It's
it's good over there. There's

522
00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:56.240
people. There's food. Oh my
gosh. The food was so

523
00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:00.290
good. I miss that. I
miss that a lot. Yeah.

524
00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:02.480
Did they just feed you?
Like you just, is it

525
00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:07.070
free or do you like
go through Completely free and

526
00:27:07.070 --> 00:27:09.710
it's it's so, I mean,
it's just, I mean, if

527
00:27:09.710 --> 00:27:11.750
you go on Yelp and
you try to find a

528
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.570
place in Chelsea to eat
the cafeterias at Google are

529
00:27:14.570 --> 00:27:16.730
like number the number one
result like that. Those are

530
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:18.710
the places to go eat.
I don't know. I just

531
00:27:18.710 --> 00:27:21.230
had this like margarita pizza
that was just delicious and

532
00:27:21.230 --> 00:27:24.080
this like salad. That was
just amazing. And I had

533
00:27:24.080 --> 00:27:26.940
this dessert, fresh coffee and
Oh, it was just great.

534
00:27:26.990 --> 00:27:29.450
It was killing me. It's
all free. It's all free.

535
00:27:29.450 --> 00:27:32.420
I mean, it's just amazing.
See, I work for Microsoft,

536
00:27:32.420 --> 00:27:35.750
but I work from home
in Portland. So like every

537
00:27:35.750 --> 00:27:37.760
once in a while, while
we're recording this podcast, I'll

538
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:40.220
just mute it and scream,
shut up. I'm recording to

539
00:27:40.220 --> 00:27:43.640
my kids, which is my
life. And I'm sitting here

540
00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.450
with my McMuffin from earlier,
which is not, it was

541
00:27:47.450 --> 00:27:50.510
not free and not fun.
I get so salty when

542
00:27:50.510 --> 00:27:53.240
I visit like Twitter or
Google and like they y'all,

543
00:27:53.330 --> 00:27:56.210
kids don't even know. I
become like old man who

544
00:27:56.210 --> 00:28:01.130
shakes stick cloud free food.
It's totally unfair. Yeah. Back

545
00:28:01.130 --> 00:28:03.290
in my day, I had
to eat a McMuffin and

546
00:28:03.290 --> 00:28:07.670
my day being today. Yeah,
Exactly. But, but if I

547
00:28:07.670 --> 00:28:11.060
were in the free food
group, I would be like,

548
00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:13.490
you know, you plebs, why
don't you have free food?

549
00:28:13.490 --> 00:28:16.010
You know, They should give
you a stipend or something.

550
00:28:16.010 --> 00:28:18.440
Since you don't get the
free food, I should totally

551
00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:21.320
get me a free food
stipend. Actually. I don't usually

552
00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:24.080
try to talk too much
on a podcast, but true

553
00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:27.110
story. One time, one time
in the last 11 years,

554
00:28:27.110 --> 00:28:29.480
I got to go business
class and I went to

555
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:32.750
New Zealand, which was amazing to
go horizontally. It's way better

556
00:28:32.750 --> 00:28:35.570
than going like vertically to,
to that area of I'm

557
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.270
horizontal. I go there and
I come and I come

558
00:28:38.270 --> 00:28:40.760
back and then I get
in trouble and they audit

559
00:28:40.790 --> 00:28:42.620
because it was very expensive
and they audit my expense

560
00:28:42.620 --> 00:28:45.920
report and they say like
$10,000 to go to New Zealand

561
00:28:45.920 --> 00:28:48.350
or whatever. And then they
called me thinking, I'd maybe

562
00:28:48.350 --> 00:28:50.060
try to do something sneaky.
But then they looked at

563
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:53.750
the rest of my expense
reports cause I'm super paranoid

564
00:28:53.750 --> 00:28:58.370
about money. And it was
like subway, subway, Chipotle, subway.

565
00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.590
And they're like, Hmm. They're
like, okay, well, no one

566
00:29:00.590 --> 00:29:02.960
would really legitimately try to
rip us off and not

567
00:29:03.020 --> 00:29:06.470
eat these places. Like surely
this is a harmless person.

568
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.770
So my entire thing was
like, you know, $10,000 ticket.

569
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:11.870
And then a bunch of
like really bad food that

570
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.900
proceeding all over. And that's
what saved me from the

571
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:16.790
audit because they're like, you
know, if we found steak

572
00:29:16.790 --> 00:29:19.700
dinners, we would probably fire
you. But no, it was

573
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:23.150
just subway and Chipotle. Are
you an engineer? Sadly, I

574
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.640
am. Okay. Cause I, yeah,
I would never, I don't

575
00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:27.740
think I've ever heard anyone
describe it as I it's

576
00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:30.740
better to go horizontally. And
I just realized that you

577
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.870
meant you were lying down.
Oh, you just, Oh, I'm

578
00:29:32.870 --> 00:29:35.090
sorry. I could Sue talk
to who talks like that,

579
00:29:35.090 --> 00:29:37.250
but engineer topics like that,
you can feel free to

580
00:29:37.250 --> 00:29:40.140
use that. Who talks like
that? That is I to

581
00:29:40.180 --> 00:29:42.490
expect a blog post later
today who talks like that

582
00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:45.930
Only engineers. My husband's a
software engineer and I think

583
00:29:45.930 --> 00:29:48.450
he would say something like
that. I bet you, there

584
00:29:48.450 --> 00:29:50.910
is a top 10 list
that we put together later

585
00:29:50.910 --> 00:29:55.890
because my wife has that.
Who does that? You know

586
00:29:55.890 --> 00:29:58.410
what I mean? Yeah. And
I, and I, and the

587
00:29:58.410 --> 00:30:02.220
problem is it's infecting the
children, you know, because it's

588
00:30:02.220 --> 00:30:04.590
like, Hey, that's physics, you
know, like the 11 year

589
00:30:04.590 --> 00:30:07.980
old says something that's physics
to describe why something happened

590
00:30:07.980 --> 00:30:11.490
in the world. That isn't
necessarily physics that's happened. He

591
00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:14.790
just like that's. But what
isn't physics like everything's physics.

592
00:30:14.790 --> 00:30:17.570
Right. And that's the problem
with that statement. Like once

593
00:30:17.570 --> 00:30:20.220
something happens and it's gravity,
Hey, that's physics, magic physics,

594
00:30:20.370 --> 00:30:23.370
but now Trump opens the
government. Oh, that's physics like,

595
00:30:23.430 --> 00:30:27.450
well, no, you're not using
it. Right. But aren't you?

596
00:30:27.510 --> 00:30:31.320
I mean, really? Yeah. Well
then too, the problem is

597
00:30:31.320 --> 00:30:34.530
we're I don't want to
in it indirectly raised little,

598
00:30:34.530 --> 00:30:40.080
well actually Yeah. Yeah. Little
kids are naturally, well actually

599
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:42.870
people, right? That's what little
kids do. Well, actually, dad,

600
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.120
you know, earth is not
a sphere. It's kind of

601
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:51.150
an oblong. Oh God. Oh
wow. That's that's funny. It's

602
00:30:51.150 --> 00:30:56.130
not funny. It's quite painful,
but thank you. Well, your

603
00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.180
new book is how to
be successful without hurting men's

604
00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:05.430
feelings and people should check
you out@thecooperreview.com that book as

605
00:31:05.430 --> 00:31:08.070
well as your previous book,
how to sound smart in

606
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:12.210
meetings all available on the
most important internet website in

607
00:31:12.210 --> 00:31:15.120
the world, the Cooper review.com.
Thank you so much, Sarah Cooper

608
00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:17.070
for chatting with me today.
Thank you for having me.

609
00:31:17.670 --> 00:31:20.160
This has been another episode
of Hansel minutes and I'll

610
00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:38.580
see you again next week.
