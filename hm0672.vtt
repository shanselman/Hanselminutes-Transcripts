bitly.com/data dog shirt. <inaudible>. Hi,

8
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.660
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is another episode of Hansel

9
00:00:47.660 --> 00:00:50.810
minutes. And today I'm talking
with Marcus Carey. He's renowned

10
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:54.050
in the cybersecurity industry. He
owns threat care.com and just

11
00:00:54.050 --> 00:00:56.240
put out a book with
Jennifer, Jen called the tribe

12
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:59.420
of hackers. How are you,
sir? I'm doing great. Thanks

13
00:00:59.420 --> 00:01:02.810
for having me. Yeah, thanks
for hanging out. Now I

14
00:01:02.810 --> 00:01:05.120
understand that you started your
career in the, in the

15
00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:08.120
us Navy, but were you
hacking before that? I wasn't

16
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.690
hacking computers. I was, I
was very curious and taking

17
00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:15.290
apart things and building stuff
with my hands. So the

18
00:01:15.290 --> 00:01:17.750
U S Navy gave me
access to start doing a

19
00:01:17.750 --> 00:01:20.960
work computers though. And how
long ago was that? Because

20
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.570
I understand you also have
a master's degree in, in

21
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:26.990
network security. Yeah, so it
would have been probably 24

22
00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.590
years ago. I'm 43. I
joined the military when I

23
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.570
was 18, the military, I
did good on my, my

24
00:01:35.630 --> 00:01:39.200
interest exam. So I got
into a technical Phil call,

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:44.810
call cryptography, and, and ever
since then, I've been super

26
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:47.960
technical. And so you just
take a test and then

27
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.630
they say, all right, you're,
you know, you'll be on

28
00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:52.100
the top of the boat.
You'll be on the bottom

29
00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:53.930
of the ship. You'll be
this crypto person. Like, how

30
00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.330
do you, did they direct
you into cryptography? Or did

31
00:01:56.330 --> 00:01:58.310
you have an interest in
that already? So when I

32
00:01:58.310 --> 00:02:00.230
went to the Navy, I
just wanted to work with

33
00:02:00.230 --> 00:02:04.910
computers and you take a
test, an entrance, you take

34
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.260
an interest exam and they,
they, they use that entrance

35
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:12.110
exam to see what career
fields that you're most likely

36
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:14.720
going to be successful in.
And so that ended up

37
00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:18.020
being cryptography for me. That's
pretty amazing. I mean, and

38
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.880
now you're raising what, $5 million
in venture capital. Yeah. So

39
00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:26.570
we've for threat care, we've
raised over $4 million in funding.

40
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:30.020
That's fantastic. It's, it's so
interesting to hear about how

41
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.440
people come up, because like,
for me, I tell the

42
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.290
story about how my fifth
grade teacher loaned me an

43
00:02:36.290 --> 00:02:39.170
Apple too, because I was
getting into trouble and she

44
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.110
tried to keep me inside
other than causing trouble on

45
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.880
the streets. And so she
loaned me this Apple too,

46
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:47.930
if that had not happened,
I wouldn't be doing this.

47
00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:49.170
I wouldn't be talking to
you. Like I would have

48
00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:51.560
it. Like, it'd be like
that. You know, those movies

49
00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.780
where like someone's life splits
in half and they're doing

50
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.480
something entirely different. If you
hadn't taken that test or

51
00:02:56.480 --> 00:02:58.820
that test that told you
had told the Navy that

52
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:01.300
you'd be good at something
else, you would have been

53
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:07.020
a whole different person. Yeah,
certainly. But you know how

54
00:03:07.020 --> 00:03:09.540
I kind of look at
the world and life is

55
00:03:09.870 --> 00:03:13.530
nothing happens on accident. And
so everything that Mets to

56
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.870
be is meant to be,
so I was meant to

57
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.890
be in the military, you
know, all the good stuff

58
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:22.080
and bad stuff, even I
think there was meant to

59
00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:26.340
be. So it's just the
way my script was written.

60
00:03:26.910 --> 00:03:30.060
That's fantastic. So now you
work at threat care, you

61
00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.610
own it. You're founder and
CEO of threat care and

62
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:41.910
you are simulating intrusions on
networks. Yeah. So definitely imitating

63
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:47.880
intrusions. Essentially we imitate black
hat hackers on networks in

64
00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.580
order for our customers to
find out where they need

65
00:03:50.580 --> 00:03:54.090
to improve their cyber security.
And the cool thing about

66
00:03:54.090 --> 00:03:58.440
it is that we've automated
that process. So anybody can

67
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:01.860
use our software and, and
look like that there some

68
00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:06.270
kind of awesome hacker. Interesting.
Okay. So I'm not a

69
00:04:06.270 --> 00:04:08.760
hacker, like I break stuff
occasionally, but I've never really

70
00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:12.630
felt like I was hacking.
So the, the thing I

71
00:04:12.630 --> 00:04:16.440
find interesting is how people
be like they enter InfoSec

72
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.530
and then it's there. They're
always looking at everything with

73
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.960
a secure perspective. You know,
they're always thinking about how

74
00:04:21.960 --> 00:04:25.080
to break something. Does the
software allow me to think

75
00:04:25.080 --> 00:04:27.090
like a, or is it
thinking for me like, like

76
00:04:27.090 --> 00:04:34.470
a hacker, What a software
lays out, different different steps

77
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:38.310
in a methodology that a
hacker would take as funny

78
00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:41.310
because you can actually, you
know, have you, have you

79
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:43.020
ever did a multiple choice
test where you have to

80
00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:46.110
select on a computer where
you have to drag and

81
00:04:46.110 --> 00:04:49.620
drop the answers. So we
allow people to drag and

82
00:04:49.620 --> 00:04:53.370
drop attacks and push play
essentially, and you can do

83
00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.890
an attack. So we let
you kind of like pick

84
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:58.530
from a, you know, from
an ingredients and then you

85
00:04:58.530 --> 00:05:02.160
can build your attack step
by step. And that attack

86
00:05:02.430 --> 00:05:05.310
could be like, the first
thing that happens is, you

87
00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:08.130
know, they're stilling this and
then I moved to this

88
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.190
computer and then they steal
credit cards and then he

89
00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.890
sent them across the network
and all those different things.

90
00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:17.400
So you can script it
out in a scenario. Interesting.

91
00:05:17.400 --> 00:05:22.410
It's like an orchestrator. Yeah,
definitely. You can orchestrate the

92
00:05:22.410 --> 00:05:27.570
cyber taps. Yeah. That's pretty
cool. So yeah, You also

93
00:05:27.570 --> 00:05:29.430
went to and put a
book together that now I've

94
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.400
just seen is on Amazon
now called tribe of hackers.

95
00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:35.100
And it's basically cybersecurity advice
from the best hackers in

96
00:05:35.100 --> 00:05:36.930
the world. And as of
us talking right now is

97
00:05:36.930 --> 00:05:40.350
number one release in, in
computer hacking, you put this

98
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.690
together with Jennifer gin. Yeah.
So we released that book

99
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.270
three weeks ago. It's pretty
much been number one book

100
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:51.330
has been borrow. We've sold
thousands of copies of the

101
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:53.790
book, all the proceeds go
to charity too, by the

102
00:05:53.790 --> 00:05:59.210
way. And so Jennifer is
actually my head of communications

103
00:05:59.210 --> 00:06:02.810
at threat care. So she
actually helped me put that

104
00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:06.550
together and manage the project
for us. Okay. And you

105
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:09.970
actually went and talked to
a bunch of hackers and

106
00:06:09.970 --> 00:06:12.520
cyber cybersecurity experts. Some of
which are people that we

107
00:06:12.520 --> 00:06:14.350
know their names that are
famous and some that are

108
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:16.180
maybe up and coming that
we might not have heard

109
00:06:16.180 --> 00:06:19.330
of. Yeah, absolutely. It was
important to get a good

110
00:06:19.330 --> 00:06:23.650
blend. I see in life,
sometimes you could actually talk

111
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.430
to people that are like,
ha have some, all these

112
00:06:27.430 --> 00:06:30.130
accolades and sometimes you can't
relate to them as much.

113
00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:33.160
So sometimes in life you
need a mentor. They're just

114
00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.290
a little bit further down
the street than you are,

115
00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:38.170
or, you know, the road
should you, should I say,

116
00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:41.380
basically they accomplishes a little
bit more than you have

117
00:06:42.370 --> 00:06:45.010
and you, and that, that
sometimes that advice is the

118
00:06:45.010 --> 00:06:47.980
best advice you can get
while you're shooting for the

119
00:06:47.980 --> 00:06:51.700
stars. So we took a
pretty balanced approach where so

120
00:06:51.700 --> 00:06:55.570
many people are famous. I'm
using air quotes here because

121
00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.150
you know, we're all nerds.
So I, you know, I

122
00:06:58.150 --> 00:06:59.890
don't know if there's such
thing as a famous nerd,

123
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:04.480
but, but yeah. So we
put the book together and

124
00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:07.550
funny enough, some of the
people that weren't real world

125
00:07:07.550 --> 00:07:10.870
non have, have hit me
up in now, they're getting

126
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.660
invited to speak at conferences
and stuff. So it's been

127
00:07:13.660 --> 00:07:16.360
great for their careers as
well. Yeah, that's great. I

128
00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:19.930
feel that way sometimes about
this podcast, there's folks that

129
00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:22.660
I've talked to while they
were on the come up

130
00:07:23.230 --> 00:07:26.380
that are now, you know,
amazing, huge people. And it's

131
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.120
like, I feel like, Oh,
that was great. I was

132
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.270
a step on the, on
the, on the stairs as

133
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.560
a part of their come
up. And then I hear

134
00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:34.450
like, Oh, so-and-so's doing this
or doing that. It's like,

135
00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:36.160
Oh, I had them on
the show five years ago.

136
00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:40.090
That's great to lift people
up like that. Oh 100%.

137
00:07:40.990 --> 00:07:43.630
And that's why I encourage
people. If you have an

138
00:07:43.630 --> 00:07:48.310
opportunity from a business perspective
to pitch into pitch competitions,

139
00:07:48.790 --> 00:07:51.370
the more and more your
name and your brand is

140
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:56.380
out there, it all comes
back around. And they're they

141
00:07:56.380 --> 00:07:58.180
say that there is no
such thing as an overnight

142
00:07:58.180 --> 00:08:01.270
success, right? So somebody might
just see you in and

143
00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:04.150
think, Oh, you just came
up. You know, but you

144
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:06.790
know, you've been at this
for 10 years, 20 years,

145
00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:09.970
30 years. Right. So there's
no such thing as an

146
00:08:09.970 --> 00:08:12.760
overnight success. It is great
to be part of other

147
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:16.570
people's, you know, journey along
the way. And it just

148
00:08:16.570 --> 00:08:19.570
makes you feel good inside.
I think God actually created

149
00:08:19.570 --> 00:08:22.600
us to be a blessing
to other people. So we

150
00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.060
can feel that that feeling,
that, that gives you, that

151
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.090
you can't get that with
any other thing. Hmm. I

152
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:31.570
appreciate that. I appreciate that.
So you modeled the book,

153
00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:35.440
a tribe of hackers on
this idea that Timothy Ferris

154
00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.540
had this tribe of mentors
where you would come up

155
00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:39.970
with a solid group of
questions and you would add,

156
00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:42.490
ask a huge number of
people, those questions. So you

157
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:47.230
put down 14 questions around
cybersecurity, almost like a FAC,

158
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.840
but then you found like
70 different people who are

159
00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:52.570
all like notable hackers and
ask them those 14 questions.

160
00:08:52.570 --> 00:08:55.770
And that, that resulted in
a really great of course

161
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.320
edited and curated book. Yeah,
certainly I'm a big fan

162
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.550
of Tim Ferris. Funny enough.
He moved to Austin. I've

163
00:09:04.550 --> 00:09:08.090
been following me ever since
the four hour workweek. And,

164
00:09:08.270 --> 00:09:10.490
and that's what I'm saying,
like these kinds of podcasts,

165
00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:14.930
your podcast, it can be
used to inspire people. You

166
00:09:14.930 --> 00:09:17.780
know, there might be somebody,
you know, come five years

167
00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.870
later and says, Oh man,
I heard that podcast, you

168
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:25.100
know, that you were on.
And so, yeah. So I

169
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:27.920
love the fact that people
like Tim Ferris, I'm also

170
00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:31.930
kind of a big fan
of Gary Vaynerchuk. Those guys

171
00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:35.210
been putting in work for
so many years. And then

172
00:09:35.210 --> 00:09:37.070
you see that they finally
have some kind of come

173
00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:42.260
up and inspire other people
to do similar things. Yeah.

174
00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:46.970
Show will probably be somewhere
in the 670 600 and

175
00:09:46.970 --> 00:09:50.810
show 680. I had Timothy
Ferriss on this show in

176
00:09:50.810 --> 00:09:55.640
June of 2007, 12 years
ago, he was show number

177
00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:01.310
70. Wow. So check that
out. Wow. That's dope. And

178
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:05.000
like, yeah. So that's what
I'm talking about. I mean,

179
00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.670
that, that shows that like
you've been putting in that

180
00:10:07.670 --> 00:10:10.850
work too. So that's why
you have such a big

181
00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:13.310
following. Well, I don't have
that. I don't have that

182
00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:17.420
Gary Vaynerchuk money, but I
would keep grinding though, because

183
00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.710
we have fun here on
the show. Love it. So

184
00:10:21.710 --> 00:10:23.870
you said also that entrepreneurship
is a big part of

185
00:10:23.870 --> 00:10:27.950
your life and that you've
worked on and sponsored pitch

186
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:30.290
contest. Why do you think
pitching is so important for,

187
00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:34.130
for people who are doing
startups? I think I tell

188
00:10:34.130 --> 00:10:37.760
people that life's a pitch.
You always pitch into people.

189
00:10:38.390 --> 00:10:41.930
You always push into people
that could be your future

190
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:44.990
employees. Like people that you're,
you know, they know that

191
00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.420
they know you, they know
your brand, they know that

192
00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:52.370
you're about your business. You're
also pitching to investors. Cause

193
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.860
like, even though that first
time you might not get

194
00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.530
an investment, what they're looking
at, you, they're looking at

195
00:10:57.530 --> 00:11:00.800
you longterm over time. And
as you pitch and you

196
00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.960
pitch and you're out there
to hurt your story, they

197
00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:07.220
hear your progression. They going
to invest someday. And then

198
00:11:07.220 --> 00:11:10.910
you, you, so you always,
you're also pushing to a

199
00:11:10.910 --> 00:11:14.630
customer. So people are listening.
Those customers are also listening

200
00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.590
to your story. And so
pitching allows you to be

201
00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:23.180
able to, to sell essentially
yourself to all those three

202
00:11:23.210 --> 00:11:27.200
different people. And so it's
good to keep that, to

203
00:11:27.200 --> 00:11:30.200
keep tight and always be
able to tell your story.

204
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.430
One of the things that
we we've actually both worked

205
00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.820
on this idea of pitch-black,
which was a S a

206
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:41.870
M pitch contest for people
of color. There was one

207
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:44.960
in Portland, there was one
in, in Austin where you

208
00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:48.650
are located. W you think
it's important for underrepresented folks

209
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.420
to make sure that they're
getting their faces out in

210
00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:52.880
front of people that look
like them, but also people

211
00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:59.500
who You're 100%. Yeah. It's
a great opportunity to get

212
00:11:59.500 --> 00:12:03.760
out there and be inspirational.
So the, the first pitch

213
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.650
blogs that they had in
Austin, I was a judge

214
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:08.560
and I got to give
feedback and I've actually mentored,

215
00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:11.290
it had like, you know,
coffee with, with some of

216
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:14.770
those founders and, and, and
still, you know, associate with

217
00:12:14.770 --> 00:12:18.580
those funders, even though I'm
not a billionaire yet I'm

218
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.710
able to pass on the
stuff that I do know.

219
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:27.490
And so also sponsor hackathons
as well. And, you know,

220
00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:31.510
just like anything that I
can do to, in the

221
00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:35.350
academic that I sponsor is
at Houston Houston Tillotson, which

222
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:39.550
is what's is a historically
black college in Austin, Texas.

223
00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:43.270
So I taught, I taught
there, I sponsored their hackathon.

224
00:12:43.290 --> 00:12:48.430
I would, their hackathon I've
helped mentor kids there through

225
00:12:48.430 --> 00:12:53.350
different programs. So the only,
the only way that people,

226
00:12:54.310 --> 00:12:56.890
you know, that you know,
that they look like me

227
00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.950
are gonna come up, is
if people start investing more

228
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:03.040
in that. And I mean,
people that look more like

229
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:05.980
them either invest in time,
if you don't have money

230
00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.310
to invest, but I'm just
blessed that I can actually

231
00:13:09.430 --> 00:13:14.010
volunteer time and, and money
when I can. Yeah. I

232
00:13:14.010 --> 00:13:16.560
think that people don't realize
that the investing of time

233
00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.740
is so important. Like simply
showing up, showing up to

234
00:13:19.740 --> 00:13:22.890
a hackathon, showing up to
a, a college or university,

235
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.140
you know, not everybody has
the money that they can

236
00:13:25.140 --> 00:13:28.290
donate, but simply being present
is, is an important thing

237
00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:34.620
showing solidarity. Yeah. 100%. I
tell this to everyone, especially

238
00:13:34.620 --> 00:13:39.360
investors. I wish investors showed
up more to those events

239
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:43.590
because even if they're not
making an investment, they definitely

240
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:47.950
can give some game, show
their show, their presence, and,

241
00:13:48.090 --> 00:13:50.820
and also show that the
investors are just normal people,

242
00:13:50.820 --> 00:13:54.690
just like everybody else. You
know, at the end of

243
00:13:54.690 --> 00:13:59.670
the day, I just want
to show people that you're

244
00:13:59.670 --> 00:14:03.750
human, you know, the four
from an investor perspective, from

245
00:14:03.750 --> 00:14:07.890
an entrepreneurial perspective, from a
developer perspective, there is no

246
00:14:07.890 --> 00:14:11.730
magic going on here. And
sometimes the kids, you know,

247
00:14:12.450 --> 00:14:14.100
the come from where I'm
from, they think it's all

248
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:18.630
magic. Yeah. I feel like
we don't sometimes teach the

249
00:14:18.630 --> 00:14:22.740
kids how to interact socially.
Like the importance, like you

250
00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:24.230
go to a conference, that's
one thing, but then you

251
00:14:24.230 --> 00:14:27.170
spend time in the hallway
conference, you know, the, the,

252
00:14:27.170 --> 00:14:30.090
the conference outside the conference,
if you're not able to

253
00:14:30.090 --> 00:14:32.700
have those interactions, you can
have, you'll have less of

254
00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.100
a good time and you'll
be less likely to network

255
00:14:35.100 --> 00:14:40.980
with people. Yeah. 100%. What
I try to tell kids

256
00:14:41.640 --> 00:14:44.910
to do most of all
though, definitely important to interact,

257
00:14:44.940 --> 00:14:48.600
but I like, I like
for them to be comfortable

258
00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:53.540
in their own skin and,
and be, and be themselves

259
00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.510
and be authentic because a
lot of times I see

260
00:14:56.510 --> 00:15:01.430
people trying to be somebody
else. They might see a

261
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:05.000
tempers or a Gary Vaynerchuk
or whatever. And what they

262
00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.720
do is they'll try to
imitate that person swag. Or

263
00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.840
if they see a, a
famous black person or whatever

264
00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:15.620
that may be like, you
know, you were made to

265
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:19.550
be special, everybody's special in
our own way and just

266
00:15:19.550 --> 00:15:23.180
be yourself at all times.
And that's the best way

267
00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:26.330
to interact, because what happens
is if you're not being

268
00:15:26.330 --> 00:15:29.900
authentic in those hallways, like
you're talking about people going

269
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:33.260
to think you fake, they
can tell, you can tell

270
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:36.560
when somebody is acting or
putting on a front, then

271
00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.560
you can tell when somebody's
being genuine. And the people

272
00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:44.540
that are genuine always have
the most uptake as far

273
00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:48.010
as like getting what they
want accomplish. I think that

274
00:15:48.010 --> 00:15:51.580
there's just because of the
rise of social media and

275
00:15:51.610 --> 00:15:54.880
particularly things like Instagram, which
I'm, I'm now convinced that

276
00:15:54.880 --> 00:15:57.340
Instagram has just to make
me feel bad about myself

277
00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:59.710
and my career. Everybody in
Instagram is getting on a

278
00:15:59.710 --> 00:16:02.380
private jet. And I'm like,
you know, sitting at subway

279
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:05.170
sandwiches while I'm scrolling through
Instagram, looking at all these

280
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.630
people on their jets. And
I'm thinking to myself, there's

281
00:16:07.630 --> 00:16:10.900
so many people out there
kicking butt that how can

282
00:16:10.900 --> 00:16:13.330
I possibly kick butt and
know, I try to keep

283
00:16:13.330 --> 00:16:15.460
my kids from looking at
stuff like that. But it's

284
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.400
just very interesting way to
think about it. Like how,

285
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.040
how can one be unique
and be themselves when we

286
00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:23.770
have the w when we
now have the ability to

287
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:29.110
see everybody out there doing
stuff and not find it

288
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:31.660
overwhelming, like if I'm already
established, I can look at

289
00:16:31.660 --> 00:16:33.790
these things and I can
say, well, good for them.

290
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.820
You know, I'm doing fine.
They're doing them cool. But

291
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.450
if I'm on the come
up, seeing your success might

292
00:16:40.450 --> 00:16:45.850
stress me out. Yeah. Certainly
the thing that I tell

293
00:16:45.850 --> 00:16:51.070
people is it's the whole,
it's, it's, it's a saying

294
00:16:51.940 --> 00:16:57.010
it's attributed to Benjamin Franklin where
they say, believe half of

295
00:16:57.010 --> 00:17:02.020
what you see and none
of what you hear. So

296
00:17:02.080 --> 00:17:05.620
when I see people on
stuff, I just believe half

297
00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:08.680
of it. And even when
an adventure game, when, when

298
00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:11.290
you heard somebody raising a
lot of money, that doesn't

299
00:17:11.290 --> 00:17:15.520
mean that they're actually operating
a successful business or a

300
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:21.190
profitable business, like in this
game, in venture capital. Usually

301
00:17:21.190 --> 00:17:23.890
when you raise money, you
have 12 to 18 months

302
00:17:23.890 --> 00:17:26.440
to prove it. And so
in it's all in an

303
00:17:26.440 --> 00:17:29.860
experiment. So what you'll see
is usually to see somebody

304
00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:34.300
raise 10, 20, $30 million, and
then 12 to 18 months

305
00:17:34.300 --> 00:17:40.840
later, they're flopping fluffery. So,
so I would encourage people

306
00:17:40.930 --> 00:17:47.050
to don't believe the hype,
all public enemy song. But

307
00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:51.240
yeah. So you're going to
see people, you're going to

308
00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:54.330
see people do that. And
don't, don't pay attention at

309
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.250
all because half of it's
fake and then like on

310
00:17:58.260 --> 00:18:02.490
a hearsay, like the second
half of that saying is

311
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.680
believe none of what you
hear, you're going to hear

312
00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:06.960
rumors and all that stuff
all the time about how

313
00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:10.470
somebody is doing this or
doing that. Just, I don't

314
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.630
believe it. I think that's
an important thing to remember

315
00:18:12.660 --> 00:18:15.360
that flex. Like if you're
flexing, if you have that

316
00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:17.520
much time to flex on
social media, are you actually

317
00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:19.350
doing the work? Because most
of the people I know

318
00:18:19.350 --> 00:18:22.350
that are really successful in
doing well are doing well,

319
00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:24.300
because they're doing the work
and you don't, you don't

320
00:18:24.300 --> 00:18:26.370
see them. They're not, they're
not as visible. And you

321
00:18:26.370 --> 00:18:27.960
won't see them on social
media. You'll see them at

322
00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:32.160
hackathons or you'll see them
at local events. Yeah, certainly.

323
00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:35.190
And I like what you
said there, local events and

324
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:39.600
hackathons are great ways to
network with people. If you

325
00:18:39.600 --> 00:18:42.480
know, people follow me on
Twitter, I'm always encouraging and

326
00:18:42.480 --> 00:18:44.790
trying to help people out.
And that's another form of

327
00:18:44.790 --> 00:18:48.840
networking. So how are you
contributing to making other people's

328
00:18:48.840 --> 00:18:51.930
lives better? And so in
business, you either going to

329
00:18:51.930 --> 00:18:56.460
save people time or money.
So those are the things

330
00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:59.270
that you have to, that
you have to do. And,

331
00:18:59.270 --> 00:19:01.740
and I would tell you,
like, if you're helping people

332
00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:05.790
like that, then you're going
to be more successful. It's

333
00:19:05.790 --> 00:19:10.590
more about cultivating those relationships
and building good relationships. So

334
00:19:10.590 --> 00:19:12.510
those are the people that
are going to win. The

335
00:19:12.510 --> 00:19:16.650
people that are promoting themselves.
They're there. They're all about

336
00:19:16.950 --> 00:19:20.010
me, me, me, and most
of the time, those people,

337
00:19:20.910 --> 00:19:24.300
they're not going to win.
You're a very good developer,

338
00:19:24.860 --> 00:19:29.060
Probably regardless, you write bugs
and that's unavoidable. What is

339
00:19:29.060 --> 00:19:31.820
avoidable is wasting time trying
to track down the cause

340
00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:35.990
of those bugs century.io provides

341

352
00:20:15.590 --> 00:20:19.580
told me something that was
interesting, that I'm about avoiding

353
00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.180
being a transactional networker. They
were getting into the software

354
00:20:23.180 --> 00:20:26.210
community, going to events and
stuff. And they were interacting

355
00:20:26.210 --> 00:20:30.230
with people who seem to
keep score on things that

356
00:20:30.230 --> 00:20:32.330
they were routing. Like you
would route someone to another

357
00:20:32.330 --> 00:20:33.890
person you say, yeah, you
should talk to. So, and

358
00:20:33.890 --> 00:20:36.200
so, which is great that
you should do that. You

359
00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:39.050
should say, Hey, Marcus, you
should meet so-and-so and they'll,

360
00:20:39.050 --> 00:20:42.530
and then boom. But if,
if I'm keeping score and

361
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:45.410
then I call you later
and I say, Hey, you

362
00:20:45.410 --> 00:20:48.280
know, I've referred you to
six people or Hey, You

363
00:20:48.280 --> 00:20:51.760
know, I've, I've let you
know, I've been basically keeping

364
00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.280
score about all the different
things and then suddenly calling

365
00:20:54.280 --> 00:20:57.760
in a favor. That's what
they call transactional networking. And

366
00:20:57.760 --> 00:20:59.860
it's definitely unhealthy. I've wonder
if you've ever bumped into

367
00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.720
that because it sounds like
you give freely of your

368
00:21:01.720 --> 00:21:07.860
time. Yeah. And it totally,
I love what you're talking

369
00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:11.460
about here. And the thing
that I I've also noticed,

370
00:21:12.090 --> 00:21:15.150
the thing that bugs me
about some of those things

371
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.660
is I like, why aren't
you helping the person really?

372
00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:24.330
Because this is what I
see definitely in the, you

373
00:21:24.330 --> 00:21:28.410
know, cause I'm black, right.
So I see that in

374
00:21:28.410 --> 00:21:33.240
different places, there's, there's one
or two black people that

375
00:21:33.270 --> 00:21:37.470
they refer all the black
people too. And so in

376
00:21:37.470 --> 00:21:40.470
Austin, there's one or two
people that you need to

377
00:21:40.470 --> 00:21:43.860
meet such and such. Or
like, since I'm in cybersecurity,

378
00:21:43.950 --> 00:21:46.770
there's one black guy that
everybody tells me, have you

379
00:21:46.770 --> 00:21:48.660
talked to such and such,
do you know this person?

380
00:21:49.290 --> 00:21:52.260
And I'm like, eh, they're
routing all the black people

381
00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:58.530
to that one person. And
so that person it's cool,

382
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:01.650
but why aren't you helping?
Like, you know what I'm

383
00:22:01.650 --> 00:22:05.280
saying? It blows, but that
blows my mind. And then

384
00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.860
at the end of the
day that the black person

385
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.410
that they're routing people to,
even if they're a VC

386
00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.490
or angel or a successful
entrepreneur, they don't have the

387
00:22:14.490 --> 00:22:18.690
bandwidth to answer every black
person's question that, that they're

388
00:22:18.690 --> 00:22:22.800
getting routed to for. Does
that make sense? Yeah. Well,

389
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.560
I think th th there's
a, there's a myth amongst

390
00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.240
any group that there can
be only one. So for

391
00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:32.550
my friends, like I'm a
type one diabetic and I

392
00:22:32.550 --> 00:22:35.220
have a pump and I'm
very visible about that. Like,

393
00:22:35.460 --> 00:22:37.320
this is something that I,
you know, you can't hide

394
00:22:37.470 --> 00:22:39.660
being black, but I could
certainly hide being diabetic. I

395
00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.490
don't need to tell people
about it, but I think

396
00:22:41.490 --> 00:22:43.830
that young diabetic kids need
to see people that are

397
00:22:43.830 --> 00:22:46.890
successful and healthy and living.
So then I'm invisible about

398
00:22:46.890 --> 00:22:49.500
that. So then I become
the one that everyone sends

399
00:22:49.500 --> 00:22:52.470
their diabetic friends to like,
like five, six times a

400
00:22:52.470 --> 00:22:54.570
week, Hey, can you have
coffee with so and so,

401
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:56.850
Hey, can you have lunch
with this person? They just

402
00:22:56.850 --> 00:23:00.030
became diabetic. Their kid just
became diabetic, but there's lots

403
00:23:00.030 --> 00:23:02.220
of other people who can
step up and help out.

404
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:03.660
And I don't, but I
don't want to be salty

405
00:23:03.660 --> 00:23:05.790
about that. You know? So
it's this balance where you

406
00:23:05.790 --> 00:23:08.550
want to represent, but at
the same time, there's a

407
00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:10.800
huge, huge community. Why is
it just going to be

408
00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.230
gotta be me? Yeah. You
kind of made me think

409
00:23:13.230 --> 00:23:15.660
about that a little bit,
but yeah. So I, I

410
00:23:15.690 --> 00:23:19.830
definitely think that, that I
think that anybody can help.

411
00:23:20.250 --> 00:23:23.730
So I would say like,
see what you can do

412
00:23:23.730 --> 00:23:27.540
for that person before passing
them on. Because a lot

413
00:23:27.540 --> 00:23:30.840
of times there's, everybody has
a unique skill set, you

414
00:23:30.840 --> 00:23:34.920
know what I'm saying? And
so, you know, what can

415
00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:38.180
you do to help that
person out? You know? And,

416
00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.320
and that's what, that's what
I'm talking about. I think

417
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.270
people see, like we're talking
to, we were talking about

418
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.610
Tim Ferriss and Gary and
just paint, things like that.

419
00:23:44.610 --> 00:23:47.000
They see like that. And
they think, well, they're so

420
00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.860
successful. They have these blogs,
they have a whole media

421
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:51.500
behind it. How can I
help? Like, I'm just trying

422
00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.460
to get people to blog
and podcast. And they'll say

423
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:59.270
things like, well, what can
I offer? And you can

424
00:23:59.270 --> 00:24:02.600
offer your story, right? You
can offer how you got

425
00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:06.080
there. That's interesting. And that's
unique to you. We shouldn't

426
00:24:07.190 --> 00:24:09.500
second guess ourselves and say,
I have nothing to offer

427
00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:12.140
because you know, I'm not
as far ahead as Marcus

428
00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:18.040
and InfoSec. Oh, you've been
here. You're, you're preaching, man.

429
00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:23.020
You land down a sermon,
man. It's like, everybody's an

430
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:28.060
expert at something you're, you're,
you're experts yourself. Probably. You're

431
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.750
probably an expert at your
background, the food, the culture,

432
00:24:31.750 --> 00:24:35.620
wherever you come from, you
probably know more about that

433
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.910
than 99% of the people
and somebody out there is

434
00:24:39.910 --> 00:24:45.180
going to find that super
interesting. And I think the

435
00:24:45.220 --> 00:24:48.100
number one thing that I
do when I mentor people

436
00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.340
is I make them believe
that their bad ass is

437
00:24:52.460 --> 00:24:56.080
just like, look, man, you
know, it looks so still

438
00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:59.230
look, brother, this is what
you have that, that nobody

439
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:04.210
else has. And everybody has
a superpower and I encouraged

440
00:25:04.210 --> 00:25:07.270
them to use whatever that
superpower is a for good.

441
00:25:07.720 --> 00:25:10.120
It's just like, if you
watch Marvel, people have all

442
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:14.380
these different powers. I encouraged
them to find a superpower

443
00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:18.130
and use that for good.
Yeah. It's funny. I love

444
00:25:18.130 --> 00:25:20.500
that. You're saying these things,
because I say the same

445
00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.920
thing. Like we just met
now doing this podcast, but

446
00:25:24.010 --> 00:25:27.010
I have like productivity talks
and talks that I've given

447
00:25:27.010 --> 00:25:30.220
where I literally have on
the slide. Everyone is an

448
00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:33.010
expert at something like find
your superpower. I tell my

449
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:34.690
kids, I've got an 11
year old and a 13

450
00:25:34.690 --> 00:25:36.790
year old. They haven't figured
out what their super powers

451
00:25:36.790 --> 00:25:39.430
are yet, but we'll figure
it out. Like it could

452
00:25:39.430 --> 00:25:41.800
be storytelling. It could be
speaking. It could be being

453
00:25:41.800 --> 00:25:44.110
in a play. It could
be lifting others up. We

454
00:25:44.110 --> 00:25:45.700
don't know. But once they
find it, they're going to

455
00:25:45.700 --> 00:25:50.470
be unstoppable. Yeah. 100%. So
that's why I'm actually a

456
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:55.960
fan of the Incredibles because
he watched it at movie.

457
00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:59.800
The kids are actually figuring
out how they fit in

458
00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:04.330
with their superpowers and how
they compliment each other as

459
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:07.060
a family and a team
and all that stuff. So

460
00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:10.300
that's all that it is.
If you haven't found that

461
00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:16.120
superpower, you know, sometimes your
super power, other people see

462
00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:20.440
it, but you don't see
it. Like my wife is

463
00:26:20.440 --> 00:26:26.200
the best listener I've ever
seen. And people randomly, even

464
00:26:26.200 --> 00:26:29.350
when we're out somewhere, randomly
people were pour their heart

465
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:32.710
out to her and she
just listens. So that's a

466
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.730
form of empathy where she
just listens and the people

467
00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:42.070
are delighted that somebody listened
to them. So that's, that's

468
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:45.840
a superpower. Not everybody has
time to listen to somebody.

469
00:26:46.170 --> 00:26:48.210
It could be as simple
as that, you know what

470
00:26:48.210 --> 00:26:52.740
I'm saying? So, but sometimes
like I see that when

471
00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:54.480
I look at my wife
and I'm like, man, that's

472
00:26:54.480 --> 00:27:00.960
crazy. But my wife think
that's just normal. So Superman,

473
00:27:01.380 --> 00:27:05.010
he believes it's natural for
Superman to be super strong,

474
00:27:05.010 --> 00:27:07.740
super fast or whatever. That's
no big deal to him,

475
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.410
but the own lookers can
all see like, God dang,

476
00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:14.280
that dude has all those
powers. Right? So sometimes you

477
00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:16.830
have to ask people, what
am I really good at?

478
00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:21.740
And then they can help
you out. Yeah. My, one

479
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.090
of the things that I'm
trying to learn about is

480
00:27:23.090 --> 00:27:25.880
like how to be really
empathetic. I I'm a fixer,

481
00:27:25.880 --> 00:27:27.800
right? I want to fix
everything. My wife is a

482
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:31.100
listener, so she will tell
me, she says this thing

483
00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.190
in her culture called cry
with the crying. Someone will

484
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:37.010
call. They'll have a problem.
Of course, I'm like, all

485
00:27:37.010 --> 00:27:38.690
right, let's break it down.
Let's break down the problem.

486
00:27:38.750 --> 00:27:42.290
We'll fix it. That's not
really healthy because this is

487
00:27:42.290 --> 00:27:45.560
a person who called to
cry. So let's let the,

488
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:48.860
let the crying happen first.
Like listening in that case

489
00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.830
is her superpower and letting
that person get that, get

490
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:53.870
that process out. They didn't
call to fix it. They

491
00:27:53.870 --> 00:27:56.090
called to have an outlet
to have a place to

492
00:27:56.090 --> 00:27:58.130
talk about it. They'll fix
it in a minute, but

493
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.860
let them have their moment.
And I've learned that from

494
00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:04.670
her. Oh yeah, man. I
couldn't, I could not agree.

495
00:28:04.670 --> 00:28:07.880
More empathy is all about
listening and not trying to

496
00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.630
fix it. So there's this
really good book. There's two

497
00:28:11.630 --> 00:28:15.320
books that I kind of
recommend, but you've probably heard

498
00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.180
about, so you want to
talk about race, you see

499
00:28:17.180 --> 00:28:20.090
in that book. Yeah, absolutely.
It has her on the

500
00:28:20.090 --> 00:28:24.610
show actually, man, that book
blew my mind because that

501
00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:28.040
it actually called out privilege.
And there's a lot of

502
00:28:28.040 --> 00:28:30.770
things that I actually didn't
know that I was privileged,

503
00:28:31.070 --> 00:28:34.340
but there was the first
person it's like, look to

504
00:28:34.340 --> 00:28:37.790
make me think about how
privilege, like, you know, crazy

505
00:28:37.790 --> 00:28:39.650
stuff. Like I was in
the military, I worked for

506
00:28:39.650 --> 00:28:43.400
NSA. I had access to
all these computers, all this

507
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.240
different things, the training, my
master's degree born in the

508
00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:52.280
U S so yeah. So,
but that book also talks

509
00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.270
about empathy and how important
it is to just sometimes

510
00:28:56.270 --> 00:28:59.090
just listen and I'll try
to fix it. Cause if

511
00:28:59.090 --> 00:29:00.860
you're, if you're trying to
fix it, you can't listen.

512
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:03.890
Well, you can't do you
can't, you can't do two

513
00:29:03.890 --> 00:29:05.810
things at the same time.
Yeah. I'm going to make

514
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:08.960
sure that there's links in
the show notes to that

515
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.360
book. So you want to
talk about race by each

516
00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:15.770
OMA <inaudible> as well as
your book. Of course. And

517
00:29:15.770 --> 00:29:18.590
when was your other recommendation?
I sorta, the next one

518
00:29:18.590 --> 00:29:24.050
is dare to lead and
lead. Yeah. By Bernay Brown.

519
00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.320
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely amazing. Because
she also talks about empathy.

520
00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:33.350
You know, something that I've
figured out and by reading

521
00:29:33.350 --> 00:29:37.700
those books is like men
and women write books differently

522
00:29:39.290 --> 00:29:43.150
because, and, and, and this
is going to be, this

523
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.040
is somewhat of a general
statement. This is what I've

524
00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.880
learned and seen where myself,
women, women, right. Well, remember

525
00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:51.400
white super-well about all kinds
of business stuff, but the

526
00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:56.230
tone of how they, they
talk about stuff is totally

527
00:29:56.230 --> 00:30:01.060
different. For instance, like crazy
enough. Scott Adams has a couple

528
00:30:01.060 --> 00:30:05.320
of books, Scott Adams. He, he
actually the, the writer of

529
00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:09.370
Dilbert, but his, his, his
tone and how he talks

530
00:30:09.370 --> 00:30:14.500
about stuff is like male,
very masculine, probably even chauvinistically

531
00:30:14.500 --> 00:30:17.650
tones. And then when I
listened to a book written

532
00:30:17.650 --> 00:30:20.920
by some of the women,
it's like a super empathetic

533
00:30:21.430 --> 00:30:25.870
feminine tones. And, and even
as subject matter, talking about

534
00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.740
empathy, because if you talk
about ying and yang energy,

535
00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:34.180
like I believe that that
men, they bring that, that

536
00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:38.530
dark energy a lot. And
so women bring the opposite

537
00:30:38.870 --> 00:30:40.930
in many cases. And I
know I'm speaking a little

538
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:43.780
bit general her, but what
I found out is like,

539
00:30:43.810 --> 00:30:47.050
it's good to take in
books from women and man

540
00:30:47.050 --> 00:30:49.090
to have some kind of
balance because a lot of

541
00:30:49.090 --> 00:30:51.580
business leaders are men. And
if you listen to the,

542
00:30:51.640 --> 00:30:55.360
that, you're just going to
be like, like hardcore, like

543
00:30:55.420 --> 00:30:59.200
that Uber type, you know,
Uber, Facebook, you know, sales,

544
00:30:59.200 --> 00:31:02.380
sales, sales, you know, whatever.
And, but if you take

545
00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:04.780
in a both, that's what
I'm trying to do with

546
00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:08.170
my company is build a
culture that accommodates both the

547
00:31:08.170 --> 00:31:12.090
ying and yang. Well, it's
also interesting to just think

548
00:31:12.090 --> 00:31:15.480
about why we think of
those things as being male

549
00:31:15.480 --> 00:31:19.230
and how we, as men
can reclaim empathy and it

550
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:21.270
can be a people thing.
And like, why can't men

551
00:31:21.270 --> 00:31:23.070
be empathetic? What does that
mean to be thought of

552
00:31:23.070 --> 00:31:26.460
as a feminine thing? Like
you look at like, people

553
00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:31.740
like the rock and who
are both very masculine in

554
00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:35.550
his presentation, but also extremely
thoughtful Terry crews. These are

555
00:31:35.550 --> 00:31:39.000
very, very empathetic men like
that. We can reclaim that

556
00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.310
as men. I could not
agree with you more. And

557
00:31:44.310 --> 00:31:47.400
so in, in English, we
would say either feminine and

558
00:31:47.400 --> 00:31:50.910
masculine in different languages, they
have different ways to describe

559
00:31:51.450 --> 00:31:54.380
this in. It's not necessarily
related to gender and all

560
00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:01.080
that stuff. So absolutely 100%
agree if you listen to

561
00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.740
some, like some of the
African culture, some of the

562
00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:09.690
far East culture, Indian culture,
they have way more ways

563
00:32:09.690 --> 00:32:12.570
to describe what I'm trying
to talk about here than

564
00:32:12.570 --> 00:32:18.960
we do. But in, in
America, for sure, the masculinity

565
00:32:20.490 --> 00:32:23.550
and not one had had
any softness about a man,

566
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.540
man, can't cry. Oh, that
stuff is definitely a problem.

567
00:32:28.290 --> 00:32:30.930
Well, man, gender is a
spectrum, right? Like once we

568
00:32:30.930 --> 00:32:33.840
figured that out, we'll, we'll
be a lot better For

569
00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:37.350
sure. I mean, so like
my, one of my best

570
00:32:37.350 --> 00:32:42.620
friends is from hotter bod
Roter, di brother, he's from

571
00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:47.330
India in their culture. They,
they do stuff like, you

572
00:32:47.330 --> 00:32:50.390
know, hold hands with their
friends. Like two males can

573
00:32:50.390 --> 00:32:53.510
walk down the street and
it's totally, totally innocent. Totally.

574
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:58.040
Nothing hug like in like
what if American saw that?

575
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:00.650
You know, he, you know,
even like, you know what,

576
00:33:00.650 --> 00:33:03.620
what's going on, man. You
know, if, if my friend

577
00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:05.570
tried to grab an American's
Manhattan, it would be a

578
00:33:05.570 --> 00:33:09.320
problem. There was a, a
really great viral video that

579
00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.540
went, it was on Twitter
a couple of days ago

580
00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.050
where a gentleman was testing
out to see whether men

581
00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:19.100
were basically, he was running
around complementing men. So we'd

582
00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:20.600
walk up to a man
on the street and say,

583
00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:22.910
Hey, nice, nice butt. Or
you look nice today or

584
00:33:22.910 --> 00:33:25.250
whatever. And he had no
idea what of those gentlemen

585
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:28.160
were gay or not. And
some of the reactions, and

586
00:33:28.160 --> 00:33:32.720
this is now in 2019,
we're super positive because the

587
00:33:32.750 --> 00:33:35.060
people who were complimenting weren't
gay, but they said, Oh

588
00:33:35.090 --> 00:33:36.560
man, that is a very
nice, thank you. You made

589
00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:40.160
my day, like it's okay
to take a compliment. It's

590
00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:42.530
okay to say, man, I
appreciate you. Thank you very

591
00:33:42.530 --> 00:33:44.840
much. And then there was
one little gift that ended

592
00:33:44.840 --> 00:33:48.230
up being the man who
walked away after the compliment,

593
00:33:48.260 --> 00:33:51.380
even though it was a
gay man giving a compliment

594
00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:53.420
to a straight man, he
had a little swagger in

595
00:33:53.420 --> 00:33:55.670
his step. So you were,
he was clear that it

596
00:33:55.670 --> 00:33:59.090
legitimately made this dude's day.
And he like was like,

597
00:33:59.090 --> 00:34:01.980
Hey, you know, somebody found
me attractive. They weren't my,

598
00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:05.120
my preferred person. But Hey,
then he just had a

599
00:34:05.120 --> 00:34:07.280
little, little swagger, a little
attitude for the rest of

600
00:34:07.280 --> 00:34:09.140
the day. And he must've
felt pretty good about himself.

601
00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:12.830
Getting that compliment live is
so awesome, dude. I love

602
00:34:12.830 --> 00:34:15.140
it. Yeah, man. Well, I
really appreciate you chatting with

603
00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:19.760
me today. People can check
you out@threatcare.com. They can sign

604
