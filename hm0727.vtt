00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:04.260
I'd like to welcome our
new sponsor. Couchbase Couchbase is

2
00:00:04.260 --> 00:00:07.260
an open source, no SQL
document and key value store

3
00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:12.120
database requires no external cash
supports CQL and analytical queries

4
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.270
for Jason data Couchbase supports
technologies like Kubernetes, java.net, JavaScript,

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:21.750
go and Python. Download it,
give it a try at

6
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:30.060
couchbase.com/hansel minutes. That's couchbase.com/hansel minutes.
And I'll remind you that

7
00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:46.370
when you support our sponsors,
you support this show. Hi,

8
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:49.370
this is Scott Hanselman. This
is Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:51.890
I'm talking with Ralph Campbell. He's
a senior manager of the

10
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:55.010
electronics department of the Lego
group. How are you, sir?

11
00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.560
I'm doing great. Scott. Good
to meet you. The Legos

12
00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:59.630
in the house era, just
for the kids, you can't

13
00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:02.570
judge me. I'm just storing
them for the children. Of

14
00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:04.580
course, of course. Then they
have full access to it

15
00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:07.190
and they never come into
your room and there's some

16
00:01:07.190 --> 00:01:09.110
paperwork they have to fill
out. I check them out

17
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:13.130
like a librarian, you know,
just because it's their education.

18
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:15.440
It's the future of the
value of their education, right?

19
00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.870
It's an investment. Really? Yeah.
You need to safeguard that

20
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:21.230
you can't really do. So
you are an electronics and

21
00:01:21.230 --> 00:01:23.600
firmware engineer. You've been one
for, for many years. Are

22
00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.720
you primarily embedded systems in
your career? Yeah, it's pretty

23
00:01:26.720 --> 00:01:29.330
much straight ahead. Embedded systems.
If it's a, if it's

24
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:31.640
not on, on the metal,
I'm not that I'm not

25
00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:33.740
interested, but it's just something
that I don't need to,

26
00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:36.140
I don't need to worry
about. So you've been doing

27
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:41.120
that for almost 30 years.
And has it been forgive

28
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.100
my ignorance? I'm going to
ask ignorant questions cause that's

29
00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:47.180
my superpower. Is it been
basically C code for 30

30
00:01:47.180 --> 00:01:50.570
years talking to the metal
of these systems? Well, yeah,

31
00:01:50.570 --> 00:01:52.340
I guess it's a, if
I look at the full

32
00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:54.710
span, it's been almost 40
years. I'm ashamed to say,

33
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:57.770
but a, it started out
in assembler language. Actually I

34
00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.330
learned to program on an
HP 41 CV calculator. So

35
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:04.670
that's, that's how far back
though? That goes. Yeah. So

36
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:07.160
you start started in assembler,
but really for the last

37
00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:10.100
30, 35 years, it's been
in C and embedded C.

38
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.880
And when we look at
the, the upleveling of the

39
00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:16.460
technology that is available to
children, the idea that a

40
00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:20.390
child could have a Lego
system that is itself a

41
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.300
computer, what is the thing
that has happened over the

42
00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:25.340
last 40 years that has
enabled that? Is it just

43
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.310
chips get faster, things, get
smaller. Why is it possible

44
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:31.010
that like the PC that
you learned on, it's probably

45
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.440
less powerful than one of
the new Lego elements that

46
00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:36.020
you're working on? I, yeah,
I think that's a fair

47
00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:39.800
statement. So Lego Mindstorms has
gone. We've got pretty much

48
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.660
a 20 year history and
I've been involved since the

49
00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:44.060
beginning on that one. So
if you remember the yellow

50
00:02:44.060 --> 00:02:47.480
RCX device that was running
on, I think, well, I

51
00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.790
can't remember the speed exactly,
but it was a dumb

52
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:55.040
little eight, eight, eight bit
microprocessor than the NXT, which

53
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:58.940
was the second generation. That
was a, basically an arm

54
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:02.290
seven. So up to 32
Bit the <inaudible>, which, which

55
00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:06.670
I founded <inaudible> dev, which
is a full Linux distribution

56
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.580
that runs on the <inaudible>.
That's a, that's a full

57
00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:12.310
arm nine and it's actually
rocking pretty hard that one.

58
00:03:13.030 --> 00:03:15.370
And now we've got a
spike prime that we just

59
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.490
released this January and we're
back down to an arm

60
00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:21.610
on that one. But the
cool thing is that we've

61
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:24.490
got a micro pipe and
I think that's one of

62
00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:27.880
the, one of the most
amazing thing that's happened in

63
00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.000
the last five years is
the, the amount of effort

64
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.730
that's gone to, to put
micro Pythen on a mic

65
00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:36.640
on a microprocessor. So you,
you can get, you know,

66
00:03:36.670 --> 00:03:39.250
pie boards, ADA fruit has
a bunch of different boards,

67
00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:42.490
and I'm, I'm really glad
to say that Lego mines

68
00:03:42.520 --> 00:03:47.910
or Lego, sorry, Lego spike
prime has micro Pythen as

69
00:03:47.980 --> 00:03:51.700
kind of a core, core
way of doing things. So

70
00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:54.430
you can, you can actually
program it a plug, plug

71
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:56.290
it in over USB, and
it looks like a serial

72
00:03:56.290 --> 00:03:59.350
terminal and you can just
click away and, and put

73
00:03:59.350 --> 00:04:02.370
Python code right on there.
Traditionally, when I've seen embedded

74
00:04:02.370 --> 00:04:05.400
systems in toys, I have
found in the past that

75
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:09.210
the companies tend to put
a friendly face on it.

76
00:04:09.210 --> 00:04:11.640
It's like, here's our thing.
Here's our toy. Like, here's

77
00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.090
an <inaudible> for example, which
has a wonderful Lego kit

78
00:04:15.090 --> 00:04:17.250
that you can still get
today. And then here is

79
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:21.210
our, our IDE right, our
integrated development environment for children.

80
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:24.060
Do you think that there's
a movement towards being able

81
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:25.920
to say, all right, here's
a text file. Here's a

82
00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:30.240
USB drive. Just start, start
coding. And when does one

83
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:32.970
start stop? And when is
one end? Yeah, that's a

84
00:04:32.970 --> 00:04:36.480
really good question. I think
putting, putting a friendly face

85
00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.260
on, on programming is something
that Lego has always been

86
00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:43.920
really interested in doing. You
can see that if it's,

87
00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:46.020
if it's drag and drop,
if there's a gooey, that

88
00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:50.610
must mean it's kid friendly,
right? And that, that bar

89
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:54.360
was really raised for me
when I watched some young

90
00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.450
kids, the session brothers who
are really big <inaudible> fans

91
00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.360
and now spike prime fans
as well. They're really quite

92
00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:03.270
famous in the FLL world.
These little guys picked up

93
00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:07.080
a Python programming just like
that. So it's really not

94
00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:11.040
just for kids, graphical programming.
So we're seeing a lot

95
00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:14.340
more of a, of a
drive towards text-based programming as

96
00:05:14.340 --> 00:05:17.940
well. But at the same
time we do spike prime

97
00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:21.840
does support scratch programming. So
you've got a nice scratchy

98
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:25.590
interface on the, on your
gooey. And then if you

99
00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:28.110
really want to, you can
lift the lid and a

100
00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.680
programming. Micropipets I think that
that's really, really significant. I

101
00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:37.920
mean, spike prime is a
very accessible environment where a

102
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.350
young kid at a nine,
10, 11 year old can

103
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.850
look at it and go,
Oh, I know this, this

104
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:43.440
is Lego. And then I
can start adding in the

105
00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:48.150
more interactive elements, but was
there a conscious decision to

106
00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:50.760
say, you know, if someone
wants to pop the hood

107
00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.510
and look at the engine
and really, you know, move

108
00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:56.760
fast and break things, we
are going to allow that

109
00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:59.120
as to maybe in the
past, not at Lego, but

110
00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:02.570
at other companies where it's
don't hack are things you're

111
00:06:02.570 --> 00:06:04.880
really encouraging that you're allowing
people to pop the hood

112
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.080
and start playing at the
low. Yep. I think that's,

113
00:06:08.710 --> 00:06:10.570
I'm not so sure it
was a conscious decision. That's

114
00:06:10.570 --> 00:06:14.020
kind of a happy accident.
I've I've been involved with,

115
00:06:14.350 --> 00:06:17.920
with Lego Mindstorms components or
elements for the last 20

116
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.080
years, not officially with Lego,
but as a, as an

117
00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:22.690
a fall, that's a adult
fan of Lego. And it's

118
00:06:22.690 --> 00:06:25.150
a term that you've obviously
heard from other people as

119
00:06:25.150 --> 00:06:29.110
well. What, what I've always
wanted to do. And what

120
00:06:29.110 --> 00:06:31.660
I have been done doing
in the past is putting

121
00:06:31.660 --> 00:06:35.350
a text based language on
every <inaudible> or sorry, every

122
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:39.220
Mindstorms brick that's been released.
So for RCX I developed

123
00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:41.560
PB Lua, which was a,
sorry, PB fourth, which is

124
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:44.620
a fourth based programming language
for the NXT. I made

125
00:06:44.620 --> 00:06:48.430
PB Lua, which is a
Lua interface for the NXT

126
00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.090
for <inaudible> of course we
pushed the whole, you know,

127
00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:55.780
real, all singing, all dancing,
Debbie and Linux on that.

128
00:06:56.110 --> 00:06:59.140
And here the, again, the
happy accident of being able

129
00:06:59.140 --> 00:07:02.230
to put micro Pythen on
a brick was just too

130
00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:04.210
good of a too good
of a match to pass

131
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:09.370
up. And, and I've always
been an advocate of, of

132
00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:11.980
people being able to kind
of open things up and

133
00:07:12.010 --> 00:07:15.160
hack things if you want
to. And what we've done

134
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.180
here with spike prime is
given adults or kids, but

135
00:07:19.180 --> 00:07:24.370
hopefully kids, the ability to
get familiar with gain confidence.

136
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.860
That's one of our main
goals here is to make

137
00:07:26.860 --> 00:07:31.270
spike primarily accessible and confidence
building tool for kids to

138
00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:34.630
learn coding. Once you're happy
with the S with what

139
00:07:34.630 --> 00:07:36.760
you can do with scratch,
if you choose to, you

140
00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.550
can lift the lid and
really go full steam ahead

141
00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.010
with Python. So it's kind
of interesting that you were

142
00:07:42.010 --> 00:07:44.410
an adult fan of Lego.
You were messing around with

143
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.620
this stuff. You were doing
things with <inaudible> PB Lewa,

144
00:07:48.010 --> 00:07:51.520
bringing a full Linux distribution
to the <inaudible>. You would

145
00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:53.380
think that in the past
a company would not say,

146
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:55.930
Oh, you should work here.
They would probably send you

147
00:07:55.930 --> 00:07:57.820
a cease and desist and
say, Hey, knock that off.

148
00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:00.700
Yeah. And that's a, that
history goes all the way

149
00:08:00.700 --> 00:08:05.230
back to the RCX myself
and a few other fans

150
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.150
that were kind of a
little more intense than most

151
00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:10.240
fans. I guess I hacked
hack the RCX. We were

152
00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:14.170
completely reverse engineered the, the,
the code for that. And

153
00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:17.360
I met some of the
original designers of the RCX

154
00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:20.890
set, the one of the
first MIT mind fests. And

155
00:08:21.910 --> 00:08:23.950
when we showed them the
source code that we had

156
00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:26.350
in reverse engineered, it was
one of those, Oh, this

157
00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:29.740
is actually almost nicer than
ours. It was a one

158
00:08:29.740 --> 00:08:32.170
for one disassembly, but with
all the comments and everything

159
00:08:32.170 --> 00:08:34.420
that we'd put in, it
was, it was pretty much

160
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:37.240
a one for one. So
at the time, I don't

161
00:08:37.240 --> 00:08:41.410
think Lego really was, how
do you want to say

162
00:08:41.890 --> 00:08:44.920
in a cease and desist
mode, they were, they were

163
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.140
kind of happy to see
fans getting so much energy.

164
00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:49.690
And when they realized the
positive buzz that the fan

165
00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:53.440
community was, was delivering, they
just said, you know what,

166
00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:55.800
go nuts, do what you
can just don't use the

167
00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:59.040
Lego name and whatever a
replacement for him or you,

168
00:08:59.050 --> 00:09:01.700
you, you produce, I don't
really think that that's, that's

169
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:04.460
great. And I love that
Lego is that kind of

170
00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:07.310
progressive. And that forward-looking because
they understand that this isn't

171
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:10.520
hacking to break things. This
is hacking to make things

172
00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.130
better. And then when you
have the, like you said,

173
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.080
the happy accidents, if you
start bringing these higher level

174
00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:18.800
languages to these, these systems,
now you've got micro Python

175
00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:22.610
on a spike prime, and
you're really encouraging people to

176
00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.380
pop the hood. You say,
if you want to use

177
00:09:24.380 --> 00:09:26.660
our regular tools, that's great.
Otherwise plug it in. It

178
00:09:26.660 --> 00:09:29.360
looks like a USB drive
and micro Python just lets

179
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.520
you save a text file
into a folder. And suddenly

180
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:34.310
you feel at least like
you're The low level. Yep.

181
00:09:34.610 --> 00:09:36.950
Actually just a quick correction.
We took away the, the

182
00:09:36.950 --> 00:09:39.410
USB drive. It just looks
like a serial port. So

183
00:09:39.410 --> 00:09:41.270
you just get a terminal
as a Chrome port. Yep.

184
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:44.660
I know the regular PI
board has the, has the

185
00:09:44.660 --> 00:09:47.990
USB file system on it.
But for us, that was

186
00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.060
a little bit too risky
in terms of, if you

187
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:53.150
unplugged it at the wrong
time, you couldn't work the

188
00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.510
file system. So we've got
little Fs, which is another

189
00:09:56.510 --> 00:09:59.630
open source file system. That's
that's used and that's pretty

190
00:09:59.630 --> 00:10:03.110
much power safe and redundant
Martin. We should actually juxtapose

191
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:06.560
juxtapose those things because in
micro Python and in circuit

192
00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:09.620
Python, you plug in these
machines and they look like

193
00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:12.830
a file system, but you're
right. If you surprise, release

194
00:10:12.830 --> 00:10:15.830
or surprise remove, you could
potentially get into trouble. But

195
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:17.360
with something like spike prime,
you really want it to

196
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:19.700
be reliable for the kids
at all times. They shouldn't

197
00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:22.610
be able to brick they're
brick they're brick. Right, right.

198
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:24.590
Yeah. And that's, and we,
we do have a, there's

199
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.110
a always a fail safe,
so you can't actually break

200
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:29.390
it. So that's, so that's
a good news. You can

201
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:31.280
replace firmware. And if it's
a bad image, you can

202
00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:34.340
always get back to the,
to the default. What is

203
00:10:34.340 --> 00:10:36.860
the, are there any kinds
of ways to inter-operate like

204
00:10:36.950 --> 00:10:39.170
we have a bunch of
<inaudible> stuff. We have a

205
00:10:39.170 --> 00:10:42.950
bunch of existing elements and
NXTs, I realized that we

206
00:10:42.950 --> 00:10:45.440
probably can't interact from a
software perspective, but is there

207
00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:48.320
any thought about like reusing
motors or bringing any motors

208
00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.880
Forward? Yeah, that's a, that's
a great question. So Evie

209
00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:55.910
three and NXT use a
kind of a modified RJ

210
00:10:55.910 --> 00:11:00.500
11 Jack for, for their
motor and sensor connections and

211
00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:03.050
with a spike prime we're
now on what's called the

212
00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:06.590
powered up connector platform. So
that means that all of

213
00:11:06.590 --> 00:11:10.520
the recent Lego components or
Lego elements such as the,

214
00:11:11.150 --> 00:11:13.700
the train motor and the,
you know, the LEDs and

215
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.760
the, the motors that are
available from the, the newer

216
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:19.280
technic kits, those all will
fit in with your spike

217
00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:24.110
spike. That's fantastic. So it
is awesome. It is amazing.

218
00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:26.420
Wow. Because I want to
be, I mean, I want

219
00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:27.920
to be able to, you
know, deal with my existing

220
00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:29.780
investment, but I also want
the children to be thinking

221
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:33.890
about other things, like, what
is the thing beyond spike?

222
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:37.190
Is it, is it something
that is a Lego product

223
00:11:37.190 --> 00:11:39.170
or is it something that's
more traditional, you know, traditional

224
00:11:39.170 --> 00:11:44.720
motors and microprocessors a raspberry
pie. Yeah. Well, so just

225
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:47.840
to be clear, the <inaudible>
and NXT motors and sensors

226
00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.240
will not work with spike
prime. Right, right, right. That's

227
00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:53.500
nice. But, but any of
the existing Lego components that

228
00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:57.390
use the powered up connector
do, Then the ones that

229
00:11:57.390 --> 00:12:00.510
use the newer powered up
connector yep. That are not

230
00:12:00.510 --> 00:12:04.770
spike prime specific they're Lego
motorized elements. Yeah. They're just

231
00:12:04.770 --> 00:12:07.740
a, that's the new that
if you see that connector,

232
00:12:07.740 --> 00:12:10.020
we just, Right. Yes. You
see, okay. I see. Power

233
00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.590
it up. Okay. Now appreciate
that. I was curious, actually

234
00:12:13.590 --> 00:12:15.780
I wanted to back up
a little bit, the Eve

235
00:12:15.810 --> 00:12:18.750
three dev project that you
founded, I think is significant

236
00:12:19.530 --> 00:12:22.620
because it is, it's really
a two full Linux distribution

237
00:12:22.650 --> 00:12:26.880
for an <inaudible>. Yeah. It's
a completely, it basically full

238
00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:33.330
Debbie and distribution. So you
can do internet. Well, it's

239
00:12:33.330 --> 00:12:35.520
a, it's an arm nine
there's 64 megs of Ram,

240
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:37.020
which is a, which is
a lot when you think

241
00:12:37.020 --> 00:12:39.600
about it compared to compared
to some things there's maybe

242
00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.990
not much anymore, it's probably
a router has more and

243
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:45.780
more Ram in it than
that, but it's enough to

244
00:12:45.780 --> 00:12:49.140
actually get things going. We've
got a full Python image

245
00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:52.980
processing. You can hook up
an old USB Lego camera

246
00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:56.430
to the <inaudible> and take
screen grabs, or actually take

247
00:12:56.430 --> 00:12:58.680
selfies with that. There's people
that have done that. There's,

248
00:12:58.710 --> 00:13:03.780
there's been projects for radio
streaming, like from the internet,

249
00:13:04.500 --> 00:13:07.710
there's all kinds of IOT
applications for it. It's really,

250
00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:10.980
really awesome. And I think
there was a competition recently

251
00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:15.000
with integrating the V3 with
it with Alexa. So it's,

252
00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:17.820
it's a pretty awesome system.
And what's really exciting about

253
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.950
that for folks that maybe
are thinking about getting a

254
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:23.580
spike prime, but they've already
got <inaudible> it's not actually

255
00:13:23.580 --> 00:13:26.070
firmware. Right. You can put
an SD card in you

256
00:13:26.070 --> 00:13:30.000
basically dual boot, you try
out your, the, the <inaudible>

257
00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:31.380
dev and then if you
don't like it, you pull

258
00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.050
out the micro SD card.
There's no flashing of that.

259
00:13:34.290 --> 00:13:38.640
That <inaudible> that's correct. Yeah.
Yeah. That's really significant. So

260
00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:41.040
w in the, in the
spike prime space, is this

261
00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:44.940
meant to be the next
generation of motorized and computerized

262
00:13:44.940 --> 00:13:47.250
Lego things? Or is it
a, is it a shoot

263
00:13:47.250 --> 00:13:49.350
off? How do you think
about the generations of, of

264
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:52.320
those things? Sure. Well, spike
prime is a, is part

265
00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:55.620
of the Lego learning system.
So that's a, that's part

266
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.620
of Lego education, which is
separate from the retail retail

267
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.190
side of the business. But
again, that's, it's completely compatible

268
00:14:02.190 --> 00:14:05.190
with any of the retail,
retail elements. We're all sequestered

269
00:14:05.190 --> 00:14:06.990
at home right now. And
I've got kids. You might

270
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.390
be able to hear them
causing trouble outside right now,

271
00:14:10.110 --> 00:14:12.810
the, the Lego spike prime
set, it's really focused on

272
00:14:12.810 --> 00:14:15.930
education, even though we're homeschooling
at this point, I can

273
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:20.490
go and buy this@education.lego.com. Absolutely.
You can. Yeah. And I

274
00:14:20.490 --> 00:14:23.850
think that's a, it's kind
of a happy coincidence. Well,

275
00:14:23.850 --> 00:14:25.530
maybe it's not a happy
coincidence that we're in the

276
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:28.230
middle of this kind of
lockdown, both in the States

277
00:14:28.230 --> 00:14:30.570
and here in Denmark, but
it's, I think it's a

278
00:14:30.570 --> 00:14:33.690
great opportunity to reconnect with,
with your kids and their

279
00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:37.020
kind of day to day
life and a, an opportunity

280
00:14:37.020 --> 00:14:40.380
to, for everybody, I think,
to kind of learn deeply

281
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:42.450
if you, if you've had
a thing that you've not

282
00:14:42.450 --> 00:14:44.100
been able to do, because
you've got a lack of

283
00:14:44.100 --> 00:14:47.580
time, this is a great
time to actually dig deep

284
00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:49.740
a little bit and, and
do some learning and do

285
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:52.100
some developing. And I'm trying
to keep them off screens

286
00:14:52.130 --> 00:14:53.780
And how they'll be on
an iPad and they'll be

287
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:55.820
working with the spike prime,
but they won't be at

288
00:14:55.820 --> 00:14:59.590
least playing fortnight. So that
makes me happy. Yeah. Well,

289
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.200
you know, that's the other
part about, about Lego is

290
00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:04.840
a, it's a fantastic building
system and it's extremely well

291
00:15:04.840 --> 00:15:07.780
thought out. So you'll find
that the construction that you

292
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.840
can do with spike prime,
it is super easy to

293
00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.300
put together a two wheel
bot and start moving, moving

294
00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:15.550
around. But if you want
to add a, you know,

295
00:15:15.580 --> 00:15:18.430
extra actions like a ball
thrower or something like that,

296
00:15:18.430 --> 00:15:20.770
you can, and there's all
kinds of resources on the

297
00:15:20.770 --> 00:15:24.430
web that you can find
that, that help you kind

298
00:15:24.430 --> 00:15:27.400
of explore and give you
inspiration for building new things.

299
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.420
The main thing that, that
spike prime gives kids, I

300
00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.240
think, and, and parents too
is, is it's kind of,

301
00:15:34.270 --> 00:15:39.220
it's an approachable, discoverable confidence
building system. It doesn't look

302
00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.610
scary. There's three buttons. Plus
the plus the connect button

303
00:15:42.610 --> 00:15:46.330
on the top. There's no
menus, there's no fancy screens

304
00:15:46.330 --> 00:15:48.760
or anything to look through.
It's basically you hit the

305
00:15:48.760 --> 00:15:51.820
left and right button to
select a swipe left and

306
00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:55.000
swipe, right. To pick which
program number, press the big

307
00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.940
white button in the middle.
And that go, it's a

308
00:15:56.940 --> 00:15:59.350
go And kids already know
how to use their iPad.

309
00:15:59.350 --> 00:16:02.350
So they're basically moving around,
scratch like elements on an

310
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:05.050
iPad or on a tablet
or PC and there in

311
00:16:05.050 --> 00:16:07.570
order to interact with it
from a, unless they choose

312
00:16:07.570 --> 00:16:09.850
to do it in a
textual mode. Right. Yeah. But

313
00:16:09.850 --> 00:16:12.970
it is, it is scratch.
It is scratch. Scratch. Scratch

314
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:16.630
MIT scratch. Oh yeah. It's
MIT scratch. Okay. So what

315
00:16:16.630 --> 00:16:20.230
does that relationship between a
micro Python and scratch? Is

316
00:16:20.230 --> 00:16:21.850
it a, is it a
mode? Is it a switch?

317
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:26.680
That's a, that's a great
question. So underneath we actually

318
00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:33.130
trans compiler trans trans pile.
If you start making portmanteaus,

319
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:38.110
you can, transpile the, whatever
the scratch scratch blocks are

320
00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:41.770
translated into actual, pretty dense
and hard to read Python.

321
00:16:41.770 --> 00:16:43.720
You wouldn't, if you were
to program the robot and

322
00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:46.240
Python, you wouldn't do it
that way, but it gives

323
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:48.190
a, it gives the app
a way to, you know,

324
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:50.890
manage feedback from the motors.
And so your screen gets

325
00:16:50.890 --> 00:16:54.220
updates and all that, but
yeah, it translates the scratch

326
00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:57.700
blocks into Python code. Ah,
interesting. So it, you just

327
00:16:57.700 --> 00:16:59.470
said something, you just kinda
threw it out there casually,

328
00:16:59.470 --> 00:17:00.640
but you said it gives
the app a way to

329
00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:02.680
like, you know, update the
screen. You're you're actually doing

330
00:17:02.680 --> 00:17:05.260
kind of aspect oriented programming
where like the person expresses

331
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:08.950
their intent, move the motor,
but you're injecting other lines

332
00:17:08.950 --> 00:17:12.070
of code around it so
that it might update itself

333
00:17:12.100 --> 00:17:15.310
before and after events. So
that it's completely instrumented code.

334
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:19.990
Yes, it is interesting. It's
pretty cool. I mean, when

335
00:17:19.990 --> 00:17:21.640
you get a chance to
play with it with your

336
00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:24.430
kids, I think will be
a arm wrestling for it

337
00:17:24.430 --> 00:17:26.050
for the rest of the
day. I'm looking forward to

338
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:30.310
it. No one wants to
manage databases. If they can

339
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:35.020
avoid it. That's why Mongo
DB made Mongo DB Atlas,

340
00:17:35.380 --> 00:17:39.460
a global cloud database service
that runs on AWS, GCP

341
00:17:39.460 --> 00:17:43.210
and Azure. You can deploy
a fully managed Mongo DB

342
00:17:43.210 --> 00:17:46.270
database in minutes with just
a few clicks or a

343
00:17:46.270 --> 00:17:51.540
few API calls, Mongo DB,
Atlas, automates deployment, automates updates,

344
00:17:51.570 --> 00:17:54.330
handles scaling, and more so
that you can focus on

345
00:17:54.330 --> 00:17:58.140
your application instead of taking
care of your database, you

346
00:17:58.140 --> 00:18:04.200
can get started free@mongodb.com slash
Atlas. Now, if you're already

347
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:07.860
managing a Mongo DB deployment,
Atlas has a live migration

348
00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:11.490
service, so you can migrate
it easily with minimal downtime

349
00:18:11.490 --> 00:18:14.040
and then get back to
what matters. Stop managing your

350
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:18.600
database and start using Mongo
DB Atlas. I'm curious, also

351
00:18:18.600 --> 00:18:20.820
there are add on. So
if you get to the

352
00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:23.070
idea that your classroom or
your kids may be somehow

353
00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:28.170
outgrowing it, there's this Lego
technic large hub for spike

354
00:18:28.170 --> 00:18:31.410
prime. So it's a way
to extend it even more.

355
00:18:31.950 --> 00:18:34.620
You add this brick and
you get important output supports

356
00:18:34.710 --> 00:18:37.760
for even more Stuff. Oh
no. The Lego technic large

357
00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:40.730
hub is the standalone. That's
just a standalone component that

358
00:18:40.730 --> 00:18:44.090
you can order that comes
in the original kit. Oh,

359
00:18:44.090 --> 00:18:47.540
interesting. Okay. Well, hang on
a second. So the hub

360
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:50.030
is that that's the brain,
that's the heart of it,

361
00:18:50.030 --> 00:18:53.000
right? That's the left right
buttons. You've got your light

362
00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.850
matrix five by five graphics.
You've got Bluetooth, you've got

363
00:18:55.850 --> 00:18:58.640
your gyro and you've got
your USB support. And it

364
00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:01.100
says you can use that
with the technic elements that

365
00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:04.040
you mentioned before. So I
see. So that's the heart,

366
00:19:04.190 --> 00:19:05.480
if you wanted to buy
that. And then if you

367
00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:08.780
wanted more, you would buy
the expansion kit to the

368
00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:12.410
spike price. Yeah. So the,
the spike prime a box,

369
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:14.840
as you see, it also
comes with two media motors,

370
00:19:14.840 --> 00:19:17.720
one large motor, a color
sensor, a really awesome color

371
00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:22.250
sensor, actually that gives you
everything from a standard Lego

372
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.080
colors, or you can put
it in a, a mode

373
00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.500
called HSV, which gives you
a saturation and value. That's

374
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.530
pretty cool. We've got an
ultrasonic range finder and there's

375
00:19:30.530 --> 00:19:33.890
a force sensor that measures
from a zero to 10

376
00:19:33.890 --> 00:19:36.890
Newtons of force. And then
the expansion kit that you're

377
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.080
seeing there is really for
kids that are going into

378
00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.990
FLL type competition. So it
gives them an extra motor,

379
00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:45.230
some bigger, bigger wheels, better,
bigger gears, that kind of

380
00:19:45.230 --> 00:19:49.010
thing. Okay. You know, actually
speaking of the color sensor

381
00:19:49.010 --> 00:19:51.020
stuff, one of the most
fun things, and I think

382
00:19:51.020 --> 00:19:56.000
the, the, the, the culmination
of our <inaudible> experience of

383
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.640
course, as, as, as with
everyone, is to create a,

384
00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:03.980
a Rubik's cube solver. Yep.
Right. I'm sure you've made

385
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.470
those before. And, you know,
being able to actually put

386
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:09.080
a, it blows minds, like
it's absolutely amazing to go

387
00:20:09.080 --> 00:20:13.250
and put a Rubik's cube
into an <inaudible> harness and

388
00:20:13.250 --> 00:20:16.010
have it solve the, the
roots. Yeah. Yeah. That's, I

389
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:18.860
mean, that's a, that's pretty
amazing. I think the Rubik's

390
00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:22.310
cube algorithm actually runs on
a PC, but all the

391
00:20:22.310 --> 00:20:24.830
moves and everything are executed
on the <inaudible> or no,

392
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.170
this one, I'm sorry. The
one you've got is the

393
00:20:27.170 --> 00:20:30.320
solver 50 page PDF, and
it took us a week

394
00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.110
to do it. And it's
really slow. Like it works

395
00:20:33.110 --> 00:20:35.780
hard cause it's a big,
you know, your trap deepen

396
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:38.750
double four loops. It's quite
amazing. It's written entirely in

397
00:20:38.750 --> 00:20:41.840
the <inaudible> language, which just,
which gets me to my

398
00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.120
actual, my actual question there,
which is what is the

399
00:20:44.330 --> 00:20:47.500
most impossible thing you saw
that someone built with spike

400
00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:50.080
prime where you said, I
did not think this would

401
00:20:50.080 --> 00:20:52.500
be a thing. The name
of it. Well, spike prime

402
00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:55.350
has only been out since
January. So Except for internally,

403
00:20:55.350 --> 00:20:57.000
like you're all hacking on
it. You're all playing with

404
00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.260
it. Right. Is there a
robot walking around in the

405
00:21:01.260 --> 00:21:07.080
hallways there at Lego that
we No comment, but no,

406
00:21:07.080 --> 00:21:08.900
when we do have a,
we do have some internal

407
00:21:08.970 --> 00:21:11.970
build competitions, but honestly it's
been such a frantic race

408
00:21:11.970 --> 00:21:14.640
to get this thing out
the door that we, we

409
00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.350
do play with it. But
there's, I mean, there's a

410
00:21:16.350 --> 00:21:19.290
couple of things like a
balancers, like segway kind of

411
00:21:19.290 --> 00:21:21.420
robots. We've seen those, I
guess you could do a

412
00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:24.630
segway, couldn't you? Yeah, sure.
There's there's color sorters. There's,

413
00:21:24.870 --> 00:21:27.840
you know, robots that can
sort your bricks by color

414
00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:31.320
and I kind of thing.
So there's, I'm, I'm really

415
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.330
excited to see what the
fans come up with over,

416
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.270
over the next few years.
We've got a, if you

417
00:21:36.270 --> 00:21:38.850
look at the <inaudible>, some
of the models that fans

418
00:21:38.850 --> 00:21:41.430
have built, there are just
mind blowing. We've got a

419
00:21:41.430 --> 00:21:44.400
ones that one that's actually
the most impressive one I've

420
00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:48.300
seen as two pixie cams
attached to the <inaudible>. So

421
00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:51.150
it's getting a stereo image
crab, and it's estimating where

422
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.060
a ball is in three
space and you can actually

423
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:56.190
throw a ball at it
and it'll move and catch

424
00:21:56.190 --> 00:21:59.520
the ball. It's completely mind
blowing. Wow. Yeah. And you

425
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.830
know, it's interesting, those things
take a while to kind

426
00:22:01.830 --> 00:22:04.500
of marinate in the community.
Like they put a thing

427
00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:07.020
out and someone achieves something
and you go, wow, that's

428
00:22:07.020 --> 00:22:09.840
it it's like the Rubik's
cube sorter was the pinnacle.

429
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.790
And then a year goes
by and someone says, well,

430
00:22:11.790 --> 00:22:15.420
what if we did? And
then the stereoscopic vision thing

431
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:17.460
goes, and you know what,
I'm sure no one ever

432
00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:20.520
conceived that there would be
like a three space capable

433
00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.880
Lego elements. Well, yeah. And
that's the, that's the coolest

434
00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:27.360
part about being able to
inspire one of, one of

435
00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.460
our missions or our statements
is that we want to

436
00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:33.450
inspire and develop the builders
of tomorrow. And we love

437
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.020
it when, when kids and
adults used our elements in

438
00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.520
ways that are completely unanticipated,
that's kind of where innovation

439
00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.080
is, right. It's combining known
objects and known materials in,

440
00:22:45.080 --> 00:22:49.830
in unexpected ways. And when,
when fans, you know, when

441
00:22:49.830 --> 00:22:53.760
they do fancy, fancy mocks
or my own creations for

442
00:22:53.790 --> 00:22:57.510
people that aren't familiar with,
the acronyms, they combine elements

443
00:22:57.510 --> 00:22:59.790
in ways that we have
no idea would ever be

444
00:22:59.790 --> 00:23:03.180
used. And we really love
seeing that with technology elements

445
00:23:03.180 --> 00:23:08.250
too. When you say late,
you said Lego Mach Yes.

446
00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.180
MOC my own creation. Mine,
I own creation. So we've

447
00:23:12.180 --> 00:23:16.800
got adult fans of Lego.
Yeah. AFL we've got my

448
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.920
own creation. And then the
Lego ideas has been another

449
00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:21.720
interesting thing where a lot
of innovation, it was such

450
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:23.760
a progressive thing for Lego
to do, to say, all

451
00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.700
right, you all want this
to make these vote, put

452
00:23:26.700 --> 00:23:28.230
your mouth, you know, put
your vote where your mouth

453
00:23:28.230 --> 00:23:31.050
is. Yeah, no, I think
that's been a really fantastic

454
00:23:31.050 --> 00:23:33.390
program. That's been some great
models that have come out

455
00:23:33.390 --> 00:23:36.210
of that and everything from
the space station, the Saturn

456
00:23:36.210 --> 00:23:39.960
five rocket, I've got the
women of NASA right over

457
00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:42.690
here. Correct. I've got the
women of NASA too. And

458
00:23:42.690 --> 00:23:46.250
I've actually got mine signed.
I buy two of the

459
00:23:46.250 --> 00:23:49.930
ladies. Yeah. Margaret Hamilton. I've got
Margaret Hamill. You have Margaret Hamilton.

460
00:23:50.630 --> 00:23:53.390
I have mine. Yeah. I
know it's a, it, you

461
00:23:53.390 --> 00:23:55.400
know, that photo actually, it's
funny. We talked about a

462
00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:58.430
little earlier about people that
have inspired us. And for

463
00:23:58.430 --> 00:24:01.280
me, as a, as a
young engineer, that picture of

464
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:04.880
Margaret Hamilton standing next to this
giant stack of printouts, that

465
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:06.860
was for me, was like,
wow, that is pretty cool.

466
00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:09.320
There's a lot of neat
stuff happening on, on, on

467
00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:14.480
rockets and lunar excursion module.
Yeah. So that's actually kind

468
00:24:14.480 --> 00:24:17.720
of interesting, the, the original
yellow RCX by Lego, it

469
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:21.050
actually had more compute power
than the computer that was

470
00:24:21.050 --> 00:24:25.420
on the limb, which is
mindblowing. Right. So Let's just

471
00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.400
drink that in for a
second, because that really tells

472
00:24:27.400 --> 00:24:30.070
us how things have been
moving forward. Like RCX was

473
00:24:30.130 --> 00:24:33.100
How long ago? Just over
20 years ago now. Okay.

474
00:24:33.130 --> 00:24:35.860
Okay. So 20 years ago
there were Lego elements that

475
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:37.780
we could use to teach
children how to code that

476
00:24:37.780 --> 00:24:39.670
had more power than the
machine that took us to

477
00:24:39.670 --> 00:24:44.170
the moon. Yup. And that's
completely mind blowing when you

478
00:24:44.170 --> 00:24:48.310
think about it. A little
known fact, the memory in

479
00:24:48.310 --> 00:24:51.370
the, in the limbs was
rope core memory, magnetic rope,

480
00:24:51.370 --> 00:24:55.540
core memory. And they actually
hired ladies that were knitters

481
00:24:55.570 --> 00:24:59.620
and Sowers and crochet heirs
to thread the thread, the

482
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.590
magnets into the, into the
magnetic core memory. So reprogramming,

483
00:25:02.590 --> 00:25:05.860
it actually meant, you know,
knitting effectively a new memory

484
00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:09.280
space for, for that. It
was it's completely mind blowing

485
00:25:09.280 --> 00:25:12.430
when you look at the
technology and all done in

486
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:16.030
what, 10 years crazy While
we're, while we're geeking out

487
00:25:16.030 --> 00:25:19.630
about being old, I was
at Bletchley park and I

488
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.570
went there on a random
Tuesday with my buddy. And

489
00:25:22.570 --> 00:25:24.370
there was nobody there. It
was just a Tuesday at

490
00:25:24.370 --> 00:25:26.890
one o'clock and it was
quiet. And I happened to

491
00:25:26.890 --> 00:25:29.380
be there when some of
the, the, the, the veterans

492
00:25:29.380 --> 00:25:30.940
and some of the older
folks, I think there were

493
00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:34.240
probably upwards of 90 years
old sitting there with an

494
00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:38.110
enigma machine and the Bomba
behind them. And they didn't

495
00:25:38.110 --> 00:25:41.260
have anything to do. Right.
He's 90, he's volunteering. And

496
00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.090
he's like, Hey, you know,
you want to see something.

497
00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.560
And we sat there and
we talked to this guy

498
00:25:44.560 --> 00:25:47.290
for two and a half
hours. He did a complete

499
00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:50.620
encryption run, showed us how
the enigma worked, did it,

500
00:25:50.950 --> 00:25:52.930
cracked it on the Bomba.
And we sat there and

501
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.570
we did like, hello world
on an enigma with an

502
00:25:55.570 --> 00:25:59.230
actual, you know, a person
who knew every, every bit,

503
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.040
every button, every wire, it
was absolutely extreme. That's amazing.

504
00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.170
That is absolutely amazing. Yeah.
Yeah. I really hope that

505
00:26:05.170 --> 00:26:07.180
the kids, my kids, particularly,
I have a 12 year

506
00:26:07.180 --> 00:26:10.360
old and 14 year old
as they have been exposed

507
00:26:10.360 --> 00:26:14.260
and, and marinaded effectively in
Lego for their entire life

508
00:26:14.530 --> 00:26:16.660
will be able to take
these kinds of things and

509
00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:19.900
realize that these are really
embedded systems. Like this is

510
00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.880
a full on legitimate medicine.
Like the ones you worked

511
00:26:21.880 --> 00:26:25.480
on at GE. Yeah. You
know what, that's one of

512
00:26:25.480 --> 00:26:28.000
the really amazing parts for
me is, is when I

513
00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.720
see a kids, whether they're
programming and scratch or Python,

514
00:26:32.110 --> 00:26:34.180
that the minute you get
a kid to write a

515
00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:36.940
program that turns on a
motor, I mean, turning on

516
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.580
lights and setting pixels, that's
pretty cool. But when you

517
00:26:39.580 --> 00:26:42.010
can turn on a motor,
drive your robot where you

518
00:26:42.010 --> 00:26:44.400
want to go and set
a con, you know, then

519
00:26:44.400 --> 00:26:46.230
the next step is okay,
well, I'd like to make

520
00:26:46.230 --> 00:26:48.060
it stop on a, on
a black line. So you

521
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.280
put a line of black
tape on your table, you

522
00:26:50.280 --> 00:26:52.080
run it forward and you
write a little loop that

523
00:26:52.170 --> 00:26:55.320
constantly looks at your light
sensor. And yeah, I want

524
00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:57.120
to stop when it gets
to black. When I see

525
00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.700
black and they're like, Oh,
wow, that's really cool. What

526
00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.550
can I do next? So
they are automatically kind of

527
00:27:02.550 --> 00:27:05.070
drawn into, you know, what
can I do next? Or

528
00:27:05.070 --> 00:27:07.110
if I can stop on
a line, can I follow

529
00:27:07.110 --> 00:27:10.260
a line? Right. So it's,
it's a, it's a, it's

530
00:27:10.260 --> 00:27:14.580
a really, it kind of
never ends, right. It really

531
00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:16.440
never ends where you can
go. And I know you

532
00:27:16.440 --> 00:27:20.580
talk a lot about where
in computer education, where do

533
00:27:20.580 --> 00:27:22.380
I need to draw the
line? How far down do

534
00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:24.060
I need to go? And
I'm guessing that's one of

535
00:27:24.060 --> 00:27:26.240
your next questions. Well, cause
that's the thing that I

536
00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:29.300
find so fascinating is that
there is value, I think

537
00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:32.030
in knowing how to drive
a stick shift, but there's

538
00:27:32.030 --> 00:27:34.130
also value in accepting the
fact that yeah, the Uber

539
00:27:34.130 --> 00:27:36.860
driver knows how to handle
this car, but I still

540
00:27:36.860 --> 00:27:39.740
enjoy taking it apart and
understanding what's going on. So

541
00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:41.750
I think there's different kinds
of programmers. There's ones who

542
00:27:41.750 --> 00:27:44.630
want Lego elements and they
will build amazing things with

543
00:27:44.630 --> 00:27:46.010
them. And then there are
those who want to know,

544
00:27:46.230 --> 00:27:48.230
wait a second, how did
you make the Lego element?

545
00:27:48.230 --> 00:27:51.110
What's the plastic made up?
What's the metal inside of

546
00:27:51.110 --> 00:27:53.600
this device. We have a
couple of ways of thinking

547
00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:55.100
about that at Lego. And
one of the ones that

548
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:59.090
I find most accessible is
a low floor high ceiling.

549
00:27:59.570 --> 00:28:02.090
So what that means is
that for, for kids and

550
00:28:02.090 --> 00:28:04.730
adults that want to get
involved with, with spike prime

551
00:28:04.760 --> 00:28:09.170
or any Lego technology components,
the floor should be low.

552
00:28:09.170 --> 00:28:11.330
You should have a very
low step to get in,

553
00:28:11.330 --> 00:28:13.970
to get started. But once
you're in the room, the

554
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:16.280
ceiling should be super high
so that you, no matter

555
00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:18.170
how far you want to
go with it, you can

556
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:21.380
take it there. And that's
why I like the kind

557
00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:23.810
of layers that we have.
We've got, we've got spike,

558
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.170
which is accessible and you
can usually get 95% of

559
00:28:27.170 --> 00:28:28.760
the things you want done.
You can get that done

560
00:28:28.770 --> 00:28:32.300
in, in, in scratch. If
you want to then take

561
00:28:32.300 --> 00:28:34.730
the lid off and, and
programming Python, you can, you

562
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:38.210
can do that too. So
it's a, again, a system

563
00:28:38.210 --> 00:28:40.730
that can build confidence because
not because it's hard to

564
00:28:40.730 --> 00:28:44.990
fail, but because it's, it's,
it's pretty easy to write

565
00:28:44.990 --> 00:28:47.420
programs that don't work right.
Or they don't perform as

566
00:28:47.420 --> 00:28:50.330
expected. What the nice part
of it scratches. It it's,

567
00:28:50.390 --> 00:28:54.680
it's the programs don't crash.
So it, it, it may

568
00:28:54.680 --> 00:28:56.210
not do what you wanted
it to do, but you

569
00:28:56.210 --> 00:28:58.340
can usually reason if you
build it up from small

570
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:01.790
enough pieces and systems. I
know it's another thing that

571
00:29:01.790 --> 00:29:05.360
you're really in favor of
is systems thinking is don't

572
00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:07.040
try to build the whole
robot at once. If you've

573
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:10.010
never built a robot, right.
You want to, first of

574
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:12.650
all, can I turn on
one motor? Can I control

575
00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.780
the speed? Can I move
it forward and backwards? Awesome.

576
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:16.580
Now, can I do that
with two motors? How do

577
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:18.200
I make the robot spin?
How do I make it

578
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:20.600
move forward and backwards? Okay.
Now I need to add

579
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.610
a light sensor. Now I
can add a touch. So

580
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:26.720
just start building up your
capacity or capabilities and also

581
00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:30.260
build your confidence. And that
to me is the really

582
00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:33.830
big thing about spike prime
is it's, it's just accessible

583
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:37.460
buildable and a really good
confidence builder for young people.

584
00:29:37.490 --> 00:29:40.820
Yeah. That confidence, that sense
of confidence. I know it's

585
00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:44.020
a cliche word, but I
always talk about empowerment. The

586
00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:46.480
idea that I can influence
the world around me, that

587
00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.960
I am not just a
kid. You know, I'm a

588
00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:52.150
maker, I'm an engineer. I
D I did that. I

589
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.160
told it, I commanded it,
what to do. And it

590
00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:56.680
did that thing. Now, what
else can I do? Right.

591
00:29:56.800 --> 00:29:59.140
And, and I built it,
right. I, I, I took

592
00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:02.170
familiar Lego elements and I
combined them in, in the

593
00:30:02.170 --> 00:30:04.450
ways that I had control
of. And then I made

594
00:30:04.450 --> 00:30:06.280
it, I made a robot
do what I wanted it

595
00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.920
to do, what my 12
year old is already trying

596
00:30:08.920 --> 00:30:10.450
to figure out how to
make an alarm. So if

597
00:30:10.450 --> 00:30:12.520
the 14 year old comes
into his room, that they'll

598
00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.400
somehow he'll be notified. So
he wants a burglar alarm.

599
00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:19.660
Well, he's going to love
the ultrasonic sensor then. Fantastic.

600
00:30:19.990 --> 00:30:23.170
So the spike prime is
a primarily for kids six

601
00:30:23.170 --> 00:30:25.960
to eight, but really any
age is appropriate. And it

602
00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:29.020
is again, compatible with Lego
boost, Lego technic sets some

603
00:30:29.020 --> 00:30:30.940
of the classic Lego pieces,
and you can go and

605
00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:38.560
chatting with me today, sir.
Hey, that's been great. Thanks

606
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.080
very much. Scott. We've been
talking with Ralph Hemphill from

607
00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:55.180
Lego systems. This has been
another episode of <inaudible>.
