00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.730
monitoring platform for cloud infrastructure,
applications, and logs metrics, all

3
00:00:08.730 --> 00:00:11.970
in one place from their
recent report on serverless, adoption

4
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:15.420
and trends. Datadog found half
their customer base using ECC

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:19.710
twos have now adopted AWS
Lambda. They've examined real world

6
00:00:19.710 --> 00:00:22.740
serverless usage by thousands of
companies running on millions of

7
00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:26.310
distinct serverless functions. And they
found that half of the

8
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.760
Lambda invocations run for less
than 800 milliseconds, you can

9
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.940
easily monitor all your serverless
functions in one place and

10
00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:36.900
generate serverless metrics straight from

14
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:08.300
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes

15
00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:11.510
today. I'm talking with Ayesha
Adam. She is an entrepreneur

16
00:01:11.510 --> 00:01:14.750
philanthropist and a speaker. She
has a company called drive

17
00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:17.600
her and a foundation called
the power to girls foundation

18
00:01:17.870 --> 00:01:20.300
And she is joining me
from Canada. How are you?

19
00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.550
I'm fine. Thank you. Thank
you so much, Scott, for

20
00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:25.820
this opportunity. No, I'm happy
to chat with you. You're

21
00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:27.860
all over the internet. And
I am finding all kinds

22
00:01:27.860 --> 00:01:30.080
of cool videos of you
talking to people in the

23
00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:32.600
news. And I wish I
had a media section, right

24
00:01:33.260 --> 00:01:35.390
Website about all the cool
stuff that I was doing.

25
00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.580
Thank you In Canada right
now. You're calling from Canada,

26
00:01:40.610 --> 00:01:44.300
but you also have a
relationship with Yes, absolutely. That's

27
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:50.210
my home country and An
NGO, a nongovernmental organization. We

28
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:54.260
call them nonprofits here in
the U S called power

29
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.540
to girls. Is it specific
to Ghana or is it

30
00:01:57.110 --> 00:02:00.500
by coastal kind of Ghana
and It's actually Ghana and

31
00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.790
Canada. And essentially what we
do is that we provide

32
00:02:04.820 --> 00:02:08.900
programming for marginalized girls and
our focus is around empowerment,

33
00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.110
leadership, mentorship, and really just
building up their self esteem

34
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:15.050
for them to be able
to create change within their

35
00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:17.930
various society. So we do
that both in Canada and

36
00:02:17.930 --> 00:02:20.210
in Ghana. What does that
mean to you? That empowerment?

37
00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.310
I really like saying that
a lot. I use that

38
00:02:22.310 --> 00:02:25.220
word a lot to talk
about feeling empowered. I want

39
00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.280
everyone of all kinds to
feel empowered. Why are they

40
00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:31.130
not empowered? Why are they
disempowered? So I think a

41
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.110
lot of times when we
do think of what empowerment

42
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:35.240
a lot of folks think
it is a matter of

43
00:02:35.240 --> 00:02:38.210
like, you know, giving something
to someone that they didn't

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:41.870
already have for us. And
for me personally, empowerment means

45
00:02:41.870 --> 00:02:45.620
that it's just helping them
amplify and cultivating something that

46
00:02:45.620 --> 00:02:48.590
they already have. So a
lot of times like society,

47
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:51.290
you know, when you take
young girls, for example, there's

48
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:54.020
a lot of things around
them that causes them to

49
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.110
feel less than they are,
or to think of themselves

50
00:02:57.140 --> 00:03:00.130
as less than they are.
And our program is set

51
00:03:00.130 --> 00:03:02.410
up to really remind them
of who they are, and

52
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:06.280
also like just really cultivating
that power, like that power

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.690
that they have not from
kind of like a, not

54
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:13.300
from a negative standpoint, but
really more around how can

55
00:03:13.300 --> 00:03:18.040
I really amplify amplify my
voice? How can I create

56
00:03:18.040 --> 00:03:20.110
change it in my society,
but then how can I

57
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:23.230
also make sure that the
people around me feel and

58
00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.530
understand myself, and then I
also understand everything else that

59
00:03:26.530 --> 00:03:29.260
is going on around me.
So that's where we, yeah,

60
00:03:29.260 --> 00:03:31.930
that's what we mean by
empowerment or to me or

61
00:03:31.930 --> 00:03:35.310
something, Right? Because this isn't
about a handout or, you

62
00:03:35.310 --> 00:03:38.190
know, here's some, here's some
money or here's some this,

63
00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.650
or here's some that it's
about taking a person who

64
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:44.640
feels like they have no
voice, no ability, no access,

65
00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:47.580
and saying, you can do
this. And here's the mentorship,

66
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:50.010
the community and the activities
that will, that will help

67
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:52.380
you build that, that internal
voice that tells you that

68
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:57.240
I can. Absolutely. Absolutely. So
is this, this is PR

69
00:03:57.270 --> 00:03:59.430
one on one coaching. How
is this different from a

70
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:03.420
school is like a community
center. So it is not

71
00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.000
a community center. So in
Canada, for example, one of

72
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.710
the things that we've been
able to do is actually

73
00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:10.650
build a partnership with a
school. So it works as

74
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:14.100
a afterschool program where we
actually run the programs within

75
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:16.530
the schools, with the schools
in partnership with the schools.

76
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.700
So we have facilitators that
have, we have trained personally,

77
00:04:21.330 --> 00:04:23.940
and then they go, we
disperse them across the different

78
00:04:23.940 --> 00:04:26.520
schools that we're in and
then they deliver the programs.

79
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:30.030
And then we also have
community members and community mentors

80
00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:32.880
that we, you know, work
with that would come into

81
00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:35.430
the schools and share their
personal stories. One of the

82
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:39.060
things that we've recognized, especially
for folks that are marginalized,

83
00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.050
is that representation is so
important. Representation matters so much.

84
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:47.280
So we bring folks that,
you know, have conquered their

85
00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.690
individual challenges and have broken
some of the glass ceilings

86
00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.090
that we're putting in their
place to come out and

87
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:56.940
share and share with these
girls. So, you know, sometimes

88
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.120
we'll have lawyers, we'll have
doctors, we'll have technology folks

89
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:03.240
come through, talk to the
girls and empower them and

90
00:05:03.240 --> 00:05:05.370
remind them and let them
know that they too are

91
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:08.910
capable of actually reaching those
different Heights that they want

92
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:13.980
to reach. Of course, I'm
not a, a, an underrepresented

93
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.520
group. I'm an overrepresented group,
but I'm, I'm type one

94
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:21.810
diabetic. And I noticed recently
that diabetics are now allowed

95
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.840
in America to fly an
airplane. And this might seem

96
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.760
like a small thing. And
it's certainly, I don't mean

97
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:30.600
to draw a direct comparison
between an underrepresented uneducated adolescent

98
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:34.650
girl. But when someone says,
Oh, that's a thing that

99
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:37.200
I was not able to
do. And now that is

100
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:41.760
now allowed, I don't want
to be a pilot, but

101
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:44.370
I'm like, Oh wow. Like
I could totally do that.

102
00:05:44.370 --> 00:05:45.990
Like I thought about being
a pilot, I tried to,

103
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:47.610
I could, for example, I
tried to be in the

104
00:05:47.610 --> 00:05:49.560
army. I can't be in
the army for diet because

105
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:53.580
of diabetes. These are small
things, but if you go

106
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:56.250
and think about, like you
said on your website, no

107
00:05:56.250 --> 00:05:59.750
one is more vulnerable. An
uneducated adolescent girl, think about

108
00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:03.560
the doors that are closed.
Like my biggest complaint is,

109
00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:06.620
well, gosh, I can't be
a pilot. Think of the

110
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.450
doors that are closed to
them. And then we have

111
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.020
to ask ourselves, how do
we systematically open those doors

112
00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.950
one at a time or
all. Absolutely. And I think,

113
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:17.590
you know, you, you actually
gave a really good example

114
00:06:17.590 --> 00:06:20.230
in terms of like, access,
right? So it's like one

115
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.690
thing when you know that
you have access to something

116
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.480
and then it's another thing
when it's actually close to

117
00:06:25.480 --> 00:06:27.490
you. So I think for
us, where we are, we're

118
00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:29.740
really doing is letting the
girls know that that access

119
00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:32.680
is there and they have
us and all these amazing

120
00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:35.200
women as resources to be
able to actually get to

121
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:37.330
that next step that they
want to get to. So

122
00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:41.110
then that way it becomes,
instead of it becoming them

123
00:06:41.110 --> 00:06:43.330
being shut out of it,
it becomes a choice, like

124
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:46.000
you said, so in your
case now, you know that

125
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.640
this is an option for
you. You might not necessarily

126
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:51.010
want to be a pilot,
but you know that, Hey,

127
00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:53.800
in case I want to
be a pilot, I'm actually

128
00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.780
able to do that and
I have access to that.

129
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:58.330
So that's really amazing. Yeah.
And so what do the,

130
00:06:58.330 --> 00:07:01.780
the, the young women that
you work with see themselves

131
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:04.450
doing? If they've never seen
a lawyer, a doctor, a

132
00:07:04.450 --> 00:07:08.380
programmer, or a president that
is from their place, what

133
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.360
do they think that they're
going to become a, a

134
00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:15.010
homemaker, which is fine. Yeah.
And, you know, I love

135
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.650
the fact that you actually
asked that question, because that

136
00:07:17.650 --> 00:07:19.660
is one of the key
things that we get. So

137
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:22.930
I'll give you an example.
We did a session in

138
00:07:22.930 --> 00:07:25.270
Ghana and I'm going to
use Ghana as the perfect

139
00:07:25.270 --> 00:07:27.520
example for this. So we
did a session in Ghana

140
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.350
and we asked the girls,
what are some of the

141
00:07:29.350 --> 00:07:33.130
things that they want to
pursue as a career alternative

142
00:07:33.130 --> 00:07:35.410
or an objective? And some
of the answers that we

143
00:07:35.410 --> 00:07:37.900
were here and was ridiculous.
Like, you know, I mean,

144
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.060
there were some that felt
like, you know, their only

145
00:07:40.060 --> 00:07:43.150
option was to become a
trader. And when we say

146
00:07:43.150 --> 00:07:45.610
trader, like, you know, like
a market woman, essentially, like,

147
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:48.460
you know, just selling stuff,
some of them, just food

148
00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:51.550
card or something. Exactly. Some
of them thought that, you

149
00:07:51.550 --> 00:07:54.130
know, they were, they can
do, you're supposed to be,

150
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:56.140
you know, stay at home.
They're supposed to be like

151
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.840
a wife, a mother, and
all that, which is fine

152
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.120
to the people that want
that. But then one of

153
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:03.520
the key things that we
asked them and to the

154
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:06.310
people that said, okay, I
want to be a doctor.

155
00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:08.200
I want to be a
lawyer. I want to be,

156
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:12.400
you know, an engineer. There
was always a, but so

157
00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.040
we questioned and asked why
was, but, and then they

158
00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:17.080
said, because women are not
supposed to be in the

159
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:19.510
sectors, women are not supposed
to be doing these things.

160
00:08:19.750 --> 00:08:21.880
So for us, we took
that as an opportunity to

161
00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:25.270
actually bring into the schools,
women that were in those

162
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:28.690
particular sectors. So we brought,
we brought a soldier, we

163
00:08:28.690 --> 00:08:31.330
brought a doctor, we brought
a community worker, we brought

164
00:08:31.330 --> 00:08:33.670
a lawyer, we brought a
banker for them to see

165
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:36.100
and recognize that they are
actually able to do this

166
00:08:36.100 --> 00:08:39.520
thing. So I think it's
really important to know that

167
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:42.880
in today's day and age,
because of social media, this,

168
00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:45.940
and also because of technology,
actually, there's been a lot

169
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:50.200
of like new career options
that are out there. But

170
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:52.750
then a lot of people
still don't see themselves represented

171
00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.340
or see themselves as actually
going those sectors because they

172
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.830
don't see people that look
like them, or they feel

173
00:08:58.830 --> 00:09:01.050
like it's only limited to
like, you know, a particular

174
00:09:01.050 --> 00:09:03.600
group of people. So I
love the fact that you

175
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:07.620
asked that question and honestly,
it's been, it's been amazing

176
00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:11.970
watching the girls evolve and
watching them actually challenging themselves

177
00:09:11.970 --> 00:09:16.670
to go into nontraditional roles.
Hmm. Yeah. It is important

178
00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:19.750
to note that, you know,
if you are a, a

179
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.250
homemaker, if raising a family,
if being the head of

180
00:09:22.250 --> 00:09:24.620
a household is what you
want to do. That's important

181
00:09:25.070 --> 00:09:28.370
if it is the only
option available to you, that's

182
00:09:28.370 --> 00:09:30.440
where I think we, you
and I, and I think

183
00:09:31.100 --> 00:09:33.950
people of a certain mindset
would push back because what

184
00:09:33.950 --> 00:09:36.200
it is about is choice,
right. And if you have

185
00:09:36.230 --> 00:09:40.340
zero choice, then that's not
good at all. Absolutely. Absolutely.

186
00:09:40.610 --> 00:09:43.040
Right. So you provide them
with that sense of empowerment.

187
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:45.260
You make sure that they
are getting the education that

188
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.260
they want. You're putting people
in front of them that

189
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:51.860
are like them in the
future. You're basically putting their

190
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:55.160
future selves in front of
them. Absolutely. Yeah. Basically. I

191
00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.320
love it. I love, I
love that analogy actually. Yeah.

192
00:09:58.370 --> 00:10:00.080
Can you, you can use
that and call me a

193
00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.740
consultant. If you see yourself,
it's like, if a person

194
00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:05.990
comes from the future and
says, look at me, look,

195
00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.380
look what I did that
gives someone a direction. And

196
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.390
they start to realize like,
Oh, well, there is a

197
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:15.500
path from whatever my situation
is to this new place.

198
00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.880
Absolutely, absolutely. Is this unique
to, to, to Ghana or

199
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:21.830
to the African continent though?
Because like you said, you

200
00:10:21.830 --> 00:10:25.790
are a person of two
countries. We, we, we always

201
00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:29.240
want to help people in
developing countries, but you're also

202
00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:32.050
in Canada and no doubt
that there are uneducated as

203
00:10:32.270 --> 00:10:36.230
adolescents in poverty where you
are as well. So, I

204
00:10:36.230 --> 00:10:38.570
mean, I think one of
the key things that it's

205
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:42.050
important to note is that
for a lot of like

206
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:46.070
African countries, they're the education
level. Like they are girls

207
00:10:46.070 --> 00:10:49.340
that are in school that
are educated. And then there

208
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.200
are also girls that are
not in school that, you

209
00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:53.930
know, have access to education.
So there is, it, it

210
00:10:53.930 --> 00:10:56.960
doesn't, it's not kind of
like a one way thing.

211
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.250
There's, there's different narratives everywhere.
And even in Canada. But

212
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.410
one of the things that
we recognized as we were

213
00:11:03.410 --> 00:11:06.050
building power to girls is
that there's one thing that

214
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:09.830
is common among all girls,
or even like this, despite

215
00:11:09.830 --> 00:11:12.500
what country you're in or
what environment you're in, which

216
00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.700
is like your mental wellbeing.
And the key thing that

217
00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:20.210
we recognized was that self
esteem is one of the

218
00:11:20.210 --> 00:11:25.040
biggest issues that young girls
face today, whether you in

219
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.240
Ghana, whether you're in Zimbabwe,
whether you're in Canada, self

220
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.240
esteem, low self esteem is
a really huge issue. So

221
00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:35.060
then we start asking ourselves
and we start like looking

222
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:37.490
deeper into it and look
at all the different factors

223
00:11:37.490 --> 00:11:40.340
that actually affect a young
girl's stuff. Self-esteem. So if

224
00:11:40.340 --> 00:11:42.800
you come to Canada, for
instance, and you're working with

225
00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:46.160
like a marginalized group, you
would have maybe their body

226
00:11:46.160 --> 00:11:48.800
image you'd have their hair.
You'd have, you know, societal

227
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.680
pressures, you have social media
and all of these different

228
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:54.220
things, playing a major role.
And then you go to

229
00:11:54.220 --> 00:11:56.380
other parts of Africa where
it may be the fact

230
00:11:56.380 --> 00:11:59.020
that they do not have
access to education. They do

231
00:11:59.020 --> 00:12:02.290
not. There is gender roles
that they have to uphold,

232
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.770
and there's all these different
things. So again like the,

233
00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:10.600
the narratives vary, but then
the core issue always remains.

234
00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.700
The same is that low
self esteem is actually a

235
00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:16.900
big issue for young girls
everywhere. So when we are

236
00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.150
doing our work and we're
looking at how we can

237
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:22.180
engage and empower these girls,
we look at it from

238
00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.310
like where they are. We
look at it from, you

239
00:12:24.310 --> 00:12:27.280
know, their environments. We look
at it from the society,

240
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:28.900
and then we look at
all the different factors that

241
00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:31.630
actually are affecting them and
actually allowing them to make

242
00:12:31.630 --> 00:12:34.420
some of these decisions. And
then we provide that empowerment

243
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:37.450
to counteract that. So our
work in Ghana will be

244
00:12:37.450 --> 00:12:40.630
different from our work in
Canada, in the, in terms

245
00:12:40.630 --> 00:12:42.970
of like how we deliver
it, because in Ghana, one

246
00:12:42.970 --> 00:12:45.850
of our main focuses is
around education. But then when

247
00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:48.100
we come to Canada, one
of our main focuses around

248
00:12:48.100 --> 00:12:51.640
mental wellbeing is around leadership.
It's around empowerment because we

249
00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.390
have access directly into the
schools. So it really like

250
00:12:55.390 --> 00:12:57.460
the work is the same,
but then the approach is

251
00:12:57.460 --> 00:12:59.940
different depending on where Yeah.
That makes sense. It is,

252
00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.340
it is important to note
that not all these programs

253
00:13:02.340 --> 00:13:05.400
are going to work exactly
the way, the same way

254
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:10.050
and in every country, every
culture. Absolutely. Absolutely. You mentioned

255
00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:13.080
also the importance of them
seeing people, if anyone's seeing

256
00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:16.350
someone that looks like them
in the future, do you

257
00:13:16.350 --> 00:13:18.660
call that mentorship? It's kinda
like the big brother, big

258
00:13:18.660 --> 00:13:21.060
sister program where you assign
a human being to another

259
00:13:21.060 --> 00:13:23.160
human being and you say,
this is your buddy or

260
00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:25.680
your brother or your sister.
Yeah. So we do call

261
00:13:25.680 --> 00:13:28.020
that mentorship. But I think
for us, we do not

262
00:13:28.020 --> 00:13:31.980
necessarily limit it to the
one-on-one. It's really around the

263
00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:35.460
people that we allow them
to interact with. So who

264
00:13:35.460 --> 00:13:37.530
are they talking to on
a day to day basis?

265
00:13:37.770 --> 00:13:41.730
So our facilitators are trained,
our facilitators have access to,

266
00:13:42.030 --> 00:13:44.250
you know, some of these
resources as well. And then

267
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:46.140
they talk to them and
then they see them. So

268
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.380
it's really, who are we
showing to them? Not only

269
00:13:49.380 --> 00:13:51.960
like in our meetings where
we meet up with them

270
00:13:51.960 --> 00:13:54.360
one on one, but then
it's also on social media,

271
00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:57.330
who are the people that
we are amplifying, who are

272
00:13:57.330 --> 00:14:00.210
the people that we are,
you know, we're providing where

273
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:02.130
we're shining the light on.
So I think that's kind

274
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:04.020
of like how we go
about it. And then I

275
00:14:04.020 --> 00:14:06.900
think it's also important to
note that they themselves are

276
00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:09.390
also in a way mentors
to each other. So that

277
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:12.510
peer to peer mentorship is
also very vital because we've

278
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:16.020
had girls, you know, come
together to a meeting and

279
00:14:16.020 --> 00:14:18.210
then one person is feeling
down and then they all,

280
00:14:18.210 --> 00:14:21.090
you know, chip in and
encourage that person or talk

281
00:14:21.090 --> 00:14:23.790
to that person about what
the challenges are and indeed

282
00:14:23.790 --> 00:14:26.670
problem solve someone else's issue
right then and there. So

283
00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.040
I think it's also important
to recognize the peer to

284
00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:31.650
peer relationship that they're building
with each other. And some

285
00:14:31.650 --> 00:14:33.750
of these relationships are relationships
that are going to last

286
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:36.720
for a very long time,
because again, they're also building

287
00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.570
their networks. Wow. That is
such an important thing. Just

288
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:42.090
that sense of you can
do it and being, getting

289
00:14:42.090 --> 00:14:47.850
external validation, not everyone has
unlimited internal validation. Like just

290
00:14:47.850 --> 00:14:50.700
like they say that willpower
is a well, and some

291
00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:52.610
people have deeper well than
others and you have to

292
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:57.620
refill that. Well self-esteem is
something as well as well.

293
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.620
It needs to be built
up and getting just a

294
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:03.500
friend or a mentor or
a person that you respect

295
00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:05.570
to say, Hey, look, look
at you. You did that.

296
00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:07.850
Like, you know, good, good
on you for, for, for

297
00:15:07.850 --> 00:15:11.210
pulling that off, that fills
your internal well, so that

298
00:15:11.210 --> 00:15:15.200
when, when you're alone and
you need that, that validation

299
00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:20.560
you can pull from within
Absolutely, absolutely. You've even done

300
00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.390
a number of interviews and
I've read most of them

301
00:15:22.390 --> 00:15:25.330
about like, what are some
of the lessons that you've

302
00:15:25.330 --> 00:15:27.760
experienced in working with, with
young girls? What is the

303
00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:30.610
thing that they need to
learn? That's a good question.

304
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.220
So actually they have also
thought me a lot. I

305
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:36.850
think I should really mention
that young, like working with

306
00:15:36.850 --> 00:15:39.580
these girls have thought me
myself a lot. They have

307
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:44.020
helped me grow. And they've
also kept me accountable. One

308
00:15:44.020 --> 00:15:46.690
of the biggest lessons that
I think we always like

309
00:15:46.690 --> 00:15:49.150
to shed light on for
our girls is that they

310
00:15:49.150 --> 00:15:52.750
should be true to who
they are in this day

311
00:15:52.750 --> 00:15:54.730
and age of social media.
A lot of times they

312
00:15:54.730 --> 00:15:57.640
try to be someone else
and, you know, it's, it's,

313
00:15:58.510 --> 00:16:00.100
I mean, it's easier for
me to say it, of

314
00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:02.140
course, then for them to
put it in practice and

315
00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:04.930
even as adults sometimes put
it that in practice. But

316
00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:07.390
I think it's really important
for them to really be

317
00:16:07.390 --> 00:16:10.510
staying true to who they
are as individuals and being

318
00:16:10.510 --> 00:16:13.750
able to cultivate that power
and being able to cultivate

319
00:16:13.750 --> 00:16:17.950
that self love and willpower,
like you mentioned within themselves,

320
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.330
so that they're able to
stand firm when challenges come

321
00:16:22.330 --> 00:16:24.040
their way. So those are
some of the lessons that

322
00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:27.790
I have learned. My girls
have thought me too, like,

323
00:16:27.790 --> 00:16:31.180
they've actually taught me the
power of your story. And

324
00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:33.700
I see the power of
your story because when we

325
00:16:33.700 --> 00:16:36.220
first started power two girls,
it was based off of

326
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:39.190
like my experiences as a
young immigrant girl that came

327
00:16:39.190 --> 00:16:41.680
to Canada that did not
know where to go to

328
00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.660
for resources, you know, was
not necessarily opening to the

329
00:16:46.660 --> 00:16:49.570
community. So it was really
a lot of like trot,

330
00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.750
trial and error. And as
I was sharing these stories

331
00:16:52.750 --> 00:16:54.670
with these girls, I remember
one of them coming up

332
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:56.470
to me and say, you
know, I show you need

333
00:16:56.470 --> 00:16:58.510
to share your story more
because more people need to

334
00:16:58.510 --> 00:17:03.250
hear this. So every time
I go, I'm invited to

335
00:17:03.250 --> 00:17:06.280
go somewhere and speak. They
would come with me and

336
00:17:06.310 --> 00:17:07.810
after they will say, okay,
that was in the full

337
00:17:07.810 --> 00:17:09.970
story. Next time you have
to share the full story.

338
00:17:09.970 --> 00:17:12.610
So I think it's really,
and truly, they taught me

339
00:17:12.610 --> 00:17:15.340
the power of your story
and the power of, you

340
00:17:15.340 --> 00:17:18.070
know, you're the power in
your story and actually creating

341
00:17:18.100 --> 00:17:21.130
change and change in life.
So, yeah, like they've taught

342
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:24.400
me a lot and I
think it's always reciprocal in

343
00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:26.170
terms of like the relationships
that I have with them

344
00:17:26.170 --> 00:17:30.310
because they keep me accountable.
They keep me grounded as

345
00:17:30.310 --> 00:17:35.130
well, Also teaching them accountability.
And the difference, I struggled

346
00:17:35.130 --> 00:17:37.750
with this, with my, my
young sons, they're 12 and

347
00:17:37.750 --> 00:17:40.750
14 is trying to have
them understand the difference between

348
00:17:40.750 --> 00:17:45.790
being responsible for something and
being accountable. Sometimes I'll say

349
00:17:45.790 --> 00:17:49.290
you may not be responsible
for a thing that to

350
00:17:49.290 --> 00:17:51.540
you, it could be a
bad thing, but you are

351
00:17:51.540 --> 00:17:54.390
accountable for how you choose
to react to that thing.

352
00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:58.410
Absolutely. When you need to
focus on building, do you

353
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:01.170
want to get bogged down
by your database? Mongo DB

354
00:18:01.170 --> 00:18:04.020
is an intuitive, flexible document
database that lets you get

355
00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:07.680
to building Mongo. DBS document
model is a natural way

356
00:18:07.680 --> 00:18:10.050
to represent data so you
can focus on what matters.

357
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.350
Mongo DB Atlas is the
best way to use Mongo

358
00:18:13.350 --> 00:18:16.470
DB. It's a global cloud
database service that gives you

359
00:18:16.470 --> 00:18:19.620
all of the developer productivity
of Mongo DB. Plus the

360
00:18:19.620 --> 00:18:23.280
added simplicity of a fully
managed database service. You can

361
00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:30.930
get started free with Mongo
DB atlas@mongodb.com slash Atlas. Let

362
00:18:30.930 --> 00:18:33.270
me shift the conversation a
little bit because you are

363
00:18:33.270 --> 00:18:37.170
also a founder of a
startup and you're a nontechnical

364
00:18:37.170 --> 00:18:41.340
founder. Your, your, your, your
company is called drive her.

365
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:44.990
Can you tell me about
that? Yes, absolutely. So drive

366
00:18:44.990 --> 00:18:49.610
her actually is, so it's
a tech platform that connects

367
00:18:49.610 --> 00:18:53.420
female passengers to female drivers.
And the funny thing is

368
00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:56.570
driver actually stemmed from power
to girls and the work

369
00:18:56.570 --> 00:18:59.360
that we were doing with
power to girls, because again

370
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:02.690
like my girls always come
first. So one of the

371
00:19:02.690 --> 00:19:05.600
things that I noticed was
that I was becoming, you

372
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:09.020
know, their designated driver, their
parents trusted me when they

373
00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:11.630
were going places for me
to be that designated driver

374
00:19:11.630 --> 00:19:13.880
for them. And that was
something that I was absolutely

375
00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:16.670
comfortable with because again, I
had built that relationship with

376
00:19:16.670 --> 00:19:19.040
them, but then I also
recognized that on days that

377
00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:21.290
I wasn't able to do
that, they were, there was

378
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:24.410
not a lot of options
out there for them. And

379
00:19:24.410 --> 00:19:28.730
then as the rideshare industry
in itself, you know, became

380
00:19:28.730 --> 00:19:31.970
very popular. We also noticed
that the safety of women

381
00:19:31.970 --> 00:19:35.270
was not necessarily at the
forefront of these innovations or

382
00:19:35.270 --> 00:19:40.880
these technologies. So based off
of, again, my personal experience

383
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:44.150
and speaking to other women
in their personal experiences, we

384
00:19:44.150 --> 00:19:49.310
decided to create drive her,
which is, you know, connecting

385
00:19:49.310 --> 00:19:52.460
female passengers to female drivers,
but then also providing economic

386
00:19:52.460 --> 00:19:55.070
empowerment for women as a
whole. So we looked at

387
00:19:55.070 --> 00:19:58.310
a sector that has become
very saturated, a sector that

388
00:19:58.610 --> 00:20:01.910
had become very focused and
it's, it was, it is

389
00:20:01.910 --> 00:20:05.420
still very male dominated and
thought, how can we flip

390
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:07.490
this on its head and
provide that safe space for

391
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:10.700
women. But then also recognizing
that it wasn't just women

392
00:20:10.700 --> 00:20:12.800
that want it to use
the platform. It was parents

393
00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:16.130
that also wanted to use
the platforms, parents that wanted

394
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:18.560
to use the platforms for
their parents or their kids.

395
00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:21.410
Right. So ruined truly like
it was really about creating

396
00:20:21.410 --> 00:20:24.860
a safer space for women
and kids. It is worth

397
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.590
pointing out for folks that
might go off and Google

398
00:20:27.590 --> 00:20:30.680
for drive her, that there
is a drive her.com out

399
00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:34.880
of London. That is not
the same. We're looking@driver.ca. This

400
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:38.960
is the Canadian currently in
Toronto. I'm curious if you

401
00:20:38.990 --> 00:20:42.530
were to put together an
all female taxi service, you

402
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.040
said that, that the technology
is not taking into consideration

403
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.270
women and people who might
not feel safe in a

404
00:20:49.270 --> 00:20:52.690
traditional taxi service, but it
feels like you're solving a

405
00:20:52.690 --> 00:20:56.200
problem as a woman for
women, but it's the men

406
00:20:56.200 --> 00:20:58.500
that are the problem. Shouldn't
we start a little earlier

407
00:20:58.510 --> 00:21:01.300
and tell the men not
to be, not to make

408
00:21:01.300 --> 00:21:06.110
you feel unsafe in car.
I love the fact that,

409
00:21:06.130 --> 00:21:08.040
and like I said, like
a lot, I've heard a

410
00:21:08.040 --> 00:21:10.350
lot of narratives for dryer
her, but that's the first

411
00:21:10.350 --> 00:21:12.210
one. Like this is the
first time I've heard that.

412
00:21:12.210 --> 00:21:14.910
And I love the fact
that you pointed that out,

413
00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:18.420
honestly, like that's that's shit.
That should be how it

414
00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.990
is. Right. Unfortunately, a lot
of people don't see it

415
00:21:21.990 --> 00:21:25.500
like that. So we thought
it's important for us as

416
00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.630
women and even like for
women to take their safety

417
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.540
into their own hands. Right.
So that's for the reason

418
00:21:30.540 --> 00:21:32.940
why we create a dryer
for her, because again, like

419
00:21:33.780 --> 00:21:37.320
every single narrow, like every
single time that, you know,

420
00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:41.460
we hear a story of,
we hear like a story

421
00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:44.820
of, you know, someone being
harassed or assaulted in traditional

422
00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.180
taxis or in like rideshare
platforms. It always happens to

423
00:21:48.180 --> 00:21:51.840
be women. And then, you
know, you'd also in, like

424
00:21:51.870 --> 00:21:55.350
in most cases, also kids
also encountered this as well.

425
00:21:55.350 --> 00:21:57.540
So for us, it was
really about how can we

426
00:21:57.540 --> 00:22:00.270
create a safer space? How
can we ensure that, you

427
00:22:00.270 --> 00:22:03.540
know, we are not only
empowering women, but then also

428
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:07.530
providing them with access into
a sector that has been

429
00:22:07.620 --> 00:22:10.020
male dominated for a very
long time. And it is

430
00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:12.870
worth pointing out that, of
course you are focused on

431
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:15.360
anyone who identifies as, as
a woman and they can

432
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:18.030
feel free to be involved
in that. Now there has

433
00:22:18.030 --> 00:22:21.330
been some negativity with some,
some male taxi drivers who

434
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.970
feel that that's discriminatory, but
I'm hearing you say that

435
00:22:23.970 --> 00:22:26.700
this isn't about, like, if
someone wanted to start a

436
00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.670
mail only taxi service, I
suppose they could, but the

437
00:22:29.670 --> 00:22:32.490
whole point was safety. And
if a woman does not

438
00:22:32.490 --> 00:22:36.300
feel safe and then this
is that, this is why

439
00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:40.560
that solution exists. Absolutely. Right.
Like I have never felt

440
00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:45.270
unsafe really anywhere traveling. Like
I travel a lot. In

441
00:22:45.270 --> 00:22:49.470
fact, one time I was
in, was I in Prague

442
00:22:50.370 --> 00:22:52.620
somewhere in Prague and I
was having trouble sleeping. And

443
00:22:52.620 --> 00:22:54.930
I got up at like
two in the morning and

444
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.750
I walked around like old
town Prague at like 2:00 AM.

445
00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.810
And Prague's a perfectly safe
place, I guess. But again,

446
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:04.140
everywhere is a perfectly safe
place until it's completely unsafe,

447
00:23:04.140 --> 00:23:07.110
right. Until something happens. And
I came back and I

448
00:23:07.110 --> 00:23:08.550
called my wife and I
said, yeah, I was just

449
00:23:08.550 --> 00:23:10.290
walking around. And she's like,
you were walking around a

450
00:23:10.290 --> 00:23:13.260
strange European country at two
in the morning. She's like,

451
00:23:13.260 --> 00:23:15.930
that is the most six
foot white guy thing I've

452
00:23:15.930 --> 00:23:18.540
ever heard in my life.
I was like, no one

453
00:23:18.570 --> 00:23:21.750
who does that. And I'm
like, basically all men, right.

454
00:23:21.750 --> 00:23:25.470
We happily walk around everywhere
without any fear about turning

455
00:23:25.470 --> 00:23:28.200
a corner and, and, you
know, catch it. Cause I'm

456
00:23:28.200 --> 00:23:30.180
the bad guy. Right. I'm
the woman with the trench

457
00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:33.510
coat and the hat. I
actually took a picture and

458
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.310
someone said, it looked like
I was a spy waiting

459
00:23:35.310 --> 00:23:39.750
for a meetup, you know,
somewhere in Eastern Europe safety

460
00:23:39.750 --> 00:23:42.540
first. I think it's great.
Thank you. I really appreciate

461
00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.980
that. Yeah. So as a
nontechnical, how do you do

462
00:23:45.980 --> 00:23:48.680
that? Do you have a,
a technical counterpart, like a

463
00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:51.350
bill Gates to your, to
your Steve bomber? Or how

464
00:23:51.350 --> 00:23:53.570
do you coordinate that? Because
you know your vision, but

465
00:23:53.570 --> 00:23:56.750
it sounds like you're not
the primary coder on this.

466
00:23:57.310 --> 00:23:59.770
Yeah, no, thank you. That's
actually a really good question.

467
00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:03.010
So I do not, I'm
currently, we're actually recruiting, looking

468
00:24:03.010 --> 00:24:07.000
for a technical cofounder as
we speak, but then what

469
00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.270
it was was really around
how can I transfer, share

470
00:24:10.570 --> 00:24:13.000
the vision that I have
to the developers that we're

471
00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.810
currently working with for them
to produce, you know, produce

472
00:24:16.810 --> 00:24:20.050
a solution that works. And
I think that was the

473
00:24:20.050 --> 00:24:22.150
beauty of that is actually
the beauty of this is

474
00:24:22.150 --> 00:24:25.660
because I'm able to view
my product first as a

475
00:24:25.660 --> 00:24:28.930
customer, before a founder. And
I think that gave me

476
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:31.090
greater insights because I was
able to look at it

477
00:24:31.090 --> 00:24:33.300
as like, Oh no, I
don't think our customers would

478
00:24:33.300 --> 00:24:36.220
like this. Or as a
customer, this is, you know,

479
00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:38.200
maybe we need to move
this around. Maybe we need

480
00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.440
to change this user interface.
Maybe we need to make

481
00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:43.540
sure that this speaks to
this in this way. So

482
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:48.160
it actually gave me a
deeper appreciation for the work

483
00:24:48.160 --> 00:24:51.160
that we were doing because
I was coming at it

484
00:24:51.160 --> 00:24:54.340
first, not just as a
user, not, not as a

485
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.160
founder, but then more as
a user. And I think

486
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.620
that's really important, especially for
folks that are out there

487
00:24:59.620 --> 00:25:02.500
that are building technology products
and not necessarily have that

488
00:25:02.500 --> 00:25:07.240
technical background to be able
to appreciate that aspect that

489
00:25:07.480 --> 00:25:12.520
most times the technical founder
will not necessarily be. Yeah,

490
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:15.790
definitely. You need that, that
two sides of the same

491
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:17.620
coin. You need to look
at it from different perspectives.

492
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:19.870
You need that. I know
that sometimes it's a bit

493
00:25:19.870 --> 00:25:22.390
of a cliche to say
diversity of thought, but if

494
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.060
everyone is a technical cofounder
from the same place in

495
00:25:25.060 --> 00:25:27.460
the same generation in the
same school, you're going to

496
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:31.570
miss something, there'll be a
blind spot there. Absolutely. Absolutely.

497
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:34.090
So through both of these
things, your NGO and your

498
00:25:34.090 --> 00:25:39.240
startup, I'm seeing a pattern
of using technology for, for

499
00:25:39.250 --> 00:25:42.520
social good. And whether someone
agrees or disagrees with whether

500
00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:44.680
or not there's a need
for an all female taxi

501
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:50.080
service, isn't the point? It
is you're effectively, you're calling

502
00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:53.830
it a social profit business.
Yes. Yes. So you're, you're,

503
00:25:53.830 --> 00:25:57.010
you're making it okay to
make money while also improving

504
00:25:57.250 --> 00:25:59.680
the lives of people in
some sense, in some fundamental

505
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:04.270
way changing society. Yes. That's
exactly what it is. That's

506
00:26:04.270 --> 00:26:06.550
exactly what it is. And
then how did you start

507
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.740
that this idea of the
social profit sector? Is that

508
00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:11.200
a thing that you named
or is that a well

509
00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:13.660
known space? So I think
most of the time people

510
00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:18.010
hear social, kinda like a
social enterprise. I think I

511
00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:21.730
kind of coined the social
profit aspect, mainly because again,

512
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.280
like I, a lot of
times when I hear folks

513
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:28.870
talking about technology or talking
about innovation, they always assume

514
00:26:28.870 --> 00:26:33.520
that technology is equal to
innovation, but in most cases

515
00:26:33.520 --> 00:26:35.920
that's like, that's not the
case, right. Technology is always

516
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:39.640
a conduit. Technology's always kind
of like, you know, the,

517
00:26:39.970 --> 00:26:42.370
the foundation that you use
to actually create some of

518
00:26:42.370 --> 00:26:45.150
these innovations. And then there
are some innovative things that

519
00:26:45.150 --> 00:26:48.060
you do that are not
also technology dependence. Right. So

520
00:26:48.060 --> 00:26:50.400
I think it's really important
to be able to separate

521
00:26:50.400 --> 00:26:53.310
those two. For me, it
was really important that every

522
00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:57.030
aspect of the work that
I do impacts lives. So

523
00:26:57.240 --> 00:26:59.640
it's like, yeah, how can
we still ensure that we're

524
00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:02.610
making money, but then we're
still changing and affecting lives.

525
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.620
So that was how those
two things came together. It's

526
00:27:04.620 --> 00:27:09.150
like the social profit where
you are making profit, but

527
00:27:09.150 --> 00:27:13.850
then you're also creating societal
changes And that, and then

528
00:27:13.850 --> 00:27:16.730
having that, having a sustainability
plan, having a strategy to

529
00:27:16.730 --> 00:27:19.430
go and scale that organization,
that's part of your, on

530
00:27:19.430 --> 00:27:22.370
your consulting business. Yes. So
that is one of the

531
00:27:22.370 --> 00:27:24.590
things that I focus on
is around how can we

532
00:27:24.590 --> 00:27:29.660
build sustainable programs? And this
is mainly for my sort

533
00:27:29.660 --> 00:27:31.670
of like the NGO aspect
is that how can you

534
00:27:31.670 --> 00:27:34.580
build sustainable programs? And how
can you ensure that you're

535
00:27:34.580 --> 00:27:38.660
able to build programs or
build an organization that is

536
00:27:38.660 --> 00:27:42.830
not solely dependent on grants,
but then you're able to

537
00:27:43.040 --> 00:27:45.410
really change and affect lives
and still be able to

538
00:27:45.890 --> 00:27:48.830
make enough money to sustain
the work that you're doing.

539
00:27:48.830 --> 00:27:50.630
And then also to scale
that work that you're doing,

540
00:27:51.930 --> 00:27:53.630
A lot of people are
trying to build the next

541
00:27:53.630 --> 00:27:56.180
big company and they go
and try to make a

542
00:27:56.180 --> 00:27:59.090
billion dollar company. But I
have long believed that I

543
00:27:59.090 --> 00:28:03.500
would rather have four or
$5 million companies than one giant

544
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:06.260
company. I like the idea
of spreading it, spreading it

545
00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:08.240
around. And I also liked
the idea of what I

546
00:28:08.240 --> 00:28:12.050
call a boutique startup. One
that makes some incomes and

547
00:28:12.290 --> 00:28:14.960
potentially some passive income, but
you don't necessarily need to

548
00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.930
make the next a hundred
million dollar business. I'm curious

549
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:20.660
if you think drive her
become something that gets bought

550
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:22.910
by Uber and Lyft, and
then you're a billionaire, or

551
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:25.370
do you keep it at
a comfortable, manageable size and

552
00:28:25.370 --> 00:28:28.520
make it a boutique industry
To be quite honest with

553
00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:32.510
you? For us, the focus
is always on community. The

554
00:28:32.510 --> 00:28:35.090
focus is around how we
creating that social, that social

555
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:40.400
change. So if the, if,
if our scaling our scaling

556
00:28:40.700 --> 00:28:43.250
strategy is that we get
bought out and then we're

557
00:28:43.250 --> 00:28:47.480
able to create many micro
companies around that around the

558
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:51.020
world. That's great. But then
if our customers and our

559
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.570
audience is saying, okay, we
need this here. We need

560
00:28:53.570 --> 00:28:55.190
this here. We need this
here. We need this here.

561
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:57.290
And we have the resources
to be able to do

562
00:28:57.290 --> 00:28:59.660
that too. Then that's kind
of like what the focus

563
00:28:59.660 --> 00:29:03.530
is on, but for now,
like, again, like my focus

564
00:29:03.530 --> 00:29:07.010
is around, how can we
scale? How can we really

565
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.950
create that impact and see
this, you know, in other

566
00:29:09.950 --> 00:29:12.350
parts of the world. So
like we've had folks reach

567
00:29:12.350 --> 00:29:14.960
out from the States. We
had folks reach out from

568
00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:18.290
like the ear old asking,
you know, even folks in

569
00:29:18.290 --> 00:29:22.100
Africa wanting to bring, drive
her to, you know, their

570
00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:24.980
respective communities because they see
the value in it. And

571
00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:28.010
because there's actually, there's an
actual need there. So for

572
00:29:28.010 --> 00:29:30.440
us, it's really about how
can we still create that

573
00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:33.830
change and still be able
to impact the lives that

574
00:29:33.830 --> 00:29:36.470
we wants to, again, like
I mentioned earlier, we are

575
00:29:36.470 --> 00:29:39.170
also looking for a technical
cofounder. So if there's anyone

576
00:29:39.170 --> 00:29:42.400
out there that is as,
can I say that as

577
00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:45.750
I'm not sure, I think
you're the first, but that's

578
00:29:45.750 --> 00:29:50.370
fine. Yeah. Like, you know,
if you're looking for really

579
00:29:50.370 --> 00:29:53.970
amazing, like, we would love
for it to be a

580
00:29:53.970 --> 00:29:57.300
woman that, you know, has
that technical know how that

581
00:29:57.300 --> 00:30:01.110
has that technical acumen and
is willing to join, you

582
00:30:01.110 --> 00:30:04.500
know, a social profit business,
then please let us know.

583
00:30:04.500 --> 00:30:07.680
And we'll be definitely open
to seeing how that goes.

584
00:30:08.340 --> 00:30:10.530
So we have a diverse
audience who is listening, and

585
00:30:10.530 --> 00:30:13.890
if they've made it this
far into the, the show,

586
00:30:13.890 --> 00:30:15.720
they've made it 30 minutes
into a show and they're

587
00:30:15.990 --> 00:30:18.000
on the way to work.
And maybe they're sitting in

588
00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:20.730
the parking lot or the
driveway of their job getting

589
00:30:20.730 --> 00:30:23.610
ready to go inside. And
they're thinking I've just listened

590
00:30:23.610 --> 00:30:27.000
to 30 minutes about technology
for social good. And I

591
00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.690
know that there is a,
a drive her and there

592
00:30:30.690 --> 00:30:33.270
is this empowerment. What do
I do though? As I

593
00:30:33.270 --> 00:30:35.520
walk into my job at
this company, what do I

594
00:30:35.520 --> 00:30:38.100
do with this information that
you've given us? That's a

595
00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:40.410
good question. So I think
one of the things that

596
00:30:40.410 --> 00:30:43.350
I would say is that,
think about how the work

597
00:30:43.350 --> 00:30:45.810
that you're doing and, you
know, the technologies that you're

598
00:30:45.810 --> 00:30:49.980
building is affecting the lives
of people. I think he

599
00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:52.650
should also recognize that you
have the power in your

600
00:30:52.650 --> 00:30:55.380
hands to read and truly
creates that social change that

601
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:59.130
we're talking about and recognizing
that whatever it is that

602
00:30:59.130 --> 00:31:02.190
you're building in some cases
for some people might not

603
00:31:02.190 --> 00:31:05.040
necessarily be for the everyday
person, but then how does

604
00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:08.400
it affect the everyday person
on a holistic level? Not

605
00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.060
necessarily on kind of like
a us versus them thing,

606
00:31:12.060 --> 00:31:14.460
but then more around like
a holistic aspect of it.

607
00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.470
So, yeah, those are some
of the things that I

608
00:31:16.470 --> 00:31:20.010
would say. And then one
last thing that I would

609
00:31:20.010 --> 00:31:25.590
add is that, recognizing that
again, when you're building, you're

610
00:31:25.590 --> 00:31:28.830
building for others, you're building
for people. So always put

611
00:31:28.830 --> 00:31:31.380
those people at the forefront
of whatever it is that

612
00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:35.160
you're building, and then also
engaging them in that process

613
00:31:35.160 --> 00:31:38.160
because you can not necessarily
build for other people without

614
00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.980
having them engage in that
process. Fantastic. Well, thank you

615
00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.110
so much for chatting with
me today. Thank you so

616
00:31:43.110 --> 00:31:45.660
much for having me. We've
been talking with Ayesha ADOT
