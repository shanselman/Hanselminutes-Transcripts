From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,
a weekly discussion with web

9
00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:58.100
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show

10
00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:02.660
number four 55. In this
episode, Scott talks with John Clark

11
00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:08.600
about the rise of citizen
science. Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.540
Hanselman and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

13
00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:14.510
on the phone I've got
Shondra Clark from Canada. How

14
00:01:14.510 --> 00:01:16.970
are you? I'm doing well.
How about yourself? I am

15
00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:19.220
thrilled. And I'm thrilled to
be talking to you. You

16
00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.520
have been involved in several
Canadian space advocacy groups. You've

17
00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:25.880
got a master's in science
and space studies. You are,

18
00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.800
you were featured in a
book, I'll call a woman

19
00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:30.830
in space and you are
a citizen scientists. Aren't you?

20
00:01:30.890 --> 00:01:33.650
I am indeed. Yes. It's
a, I'm fairly well rounded

21
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:35.960
in that respect. And I
like to get to get

22
00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.700
my hands dirty with the,
with real stuff whenever I

23
00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.480
can. Yeah, absolutely. What does
that mean citizen scientist? Does

24
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.990
that imply that science isn't
something that the average Joe

25
00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:48.980
or Jane can get involved
in for the last maybe

26
00:01:48.980 --> 00:01:50.660
a hundred years or so?
Actually that hasn't been the

27
00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:53.120
case. It's, it's been the
case that there's been a

28
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.530
real professionalization of science and
people haven't really felt like

29
00:01:57.530 --> 00:01:59.990
it's something that they could
do without, you know, several

30
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:04.640
degrees without specialized training and
so forth. But actually before

31
00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.130
we had the professionalization, all
kinds of people were doing

32
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:09.860
science and just anybody who
had the time or the

33
00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.870
money or the interest, and
just went out and explored

34
00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:15.080
the natural world. So to
a certain extent, citizen science

35
00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:18.470
is a return to something
we were doing once before.

36
00:02:18.890 --> 00:02:20.960
So it's a reclaiming of
something that we were maybe

37
00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.930
not allowed to do. Yes,
that's right. So citizen science

38
00:02:23.930 --> 00:02:26.390
is something where you can
get involved in a project

39
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:30.410
and actually do real science.
You might be collecting data,

40
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:35.180
you might be processing data.
You might be doing some

41
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:39.170
review of some information for
a group, but it's something

42
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:42.110
where you can actually get
involved. And it's a little

43
00:02:42.110 --> 00:02:43.460
bit different than some of
the other things you might

44
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:47.150
think of with public participation
in science, where they call

45
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:50.540
for study subjects, for example.
So with citizen science, you're

46
00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.360
not the study subject, you're
actually the researcher. So there's

47
00:02:53.630 --> 00:02:55.910
no worry about, you know,
being a Guinea pig or

48
00:02:55.910 --> 00:02:59.090
a lab rat in this
case. So are we acting

49
00:02:59.110 --> 00:03:01.180
as, are we the public
Acting as kind of a

50
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:04.770
mechanical Turk? Is this rote
work that we're doing In

51
00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:07.620
some cases, is it depends
on the project. There's a

52
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:10.140
wide range of projects that
you can get involved with.

53
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:13.530
I've got them classified on
my website. I'm starting with

54
00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.360
the lowest level where you
can just, you know, open

55
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:17.610
up your wallet and donate
to a project and make

56
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:21.450
sure something gets funded. So
for example, something like that

57
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:26.340
would be@aexperiment.com or you can
actually a fund, a study,

58
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:28.800
a direct funding of a
study to make sure something

59
00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.450
gets researched. Another one would
be Monarch watch.org. And without

60
00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:37.140
when you actually fund the
conservation of a Monarch butterfly.

61
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:39.720
So that's, that's the first
level. And then you can

62
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:43.260
get into the second level
stuff. And that's a set

63
00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:45.720
and forget type thing. And
with that, what you can

64
00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:48.690
do is you can download
a client onto your computer

65
00:03:48.870 --> 00:03:51.570
or even your Android phone
called blank, B O L

66
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:55.530
I N C and a
that sort of Berkeley. And

67
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:58.590
with this one, you can
have your computer do all

68
00:03:58.590 --> 00:04:04.020
kinds of processing of data.
So for example, there's one

69
00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.680
fight malaria at home. And
with that one year you're

70
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.400
processing data about disease, vectors
and cures and, and drugs

71
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.280
and so forth. Some of
your listeners might actually be

72
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:19.170
familiar with SETI at home,
exact same thing. Distributed computing

73
00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.570
is, is the concept behind
that. And then we get

74
00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.970
into the more hands on
stuff. And that's what I

75
00:04:23.970 --> 00:04:26.430
like to that's when you
start actually getting involved with

76
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.890
it. And, and so there
are web applications for this.

77
00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:31.290
One of the big players
in this space is called

78
00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:37.020
a Zooniverse and it zooniverse.org.
And with that one, that's

79
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:40.470
where you start into getting
processing this stuff yourself. So

80
00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:42.720
one of the projects on
there is a solar storm

81
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.420
watch. And with that, when
you get to look at

82
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:48.660
images of the sun, unfortunately,
you don't need any special

83
00:04:48.660 --> 00:04:52.440
glasses or anything like that.
And you help them identify

84
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.900
solar flares and sunspots and
storms. And by identifying that

85
00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:00.120
you give them the data,
they need to be able

86
00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:02.850
to find out if there
are patterns to solar flares,

87
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:06.150
if there are patterns to
the solar weather and then

88
00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:09.300
you, then you help them
be able to determine if

89
00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.130
there's any way we can
predict this sort of thing.

90
00:05:11.400 --> 00:05:13.170
And there are a number
of different programs on there

91
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:15.840
like that. Another really good
one on there is called

92
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.500
whale FM. And with that
one, what you can do

93
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.530
is listen to whale song
and see if you can

94
00:05:22.530 --> 00:05:26.070
identify the different patterns in
the songs and see if

95
00:05:26.070 --> 00:05:30.270
you can pick out which
pod that song might, might

96
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:32.760
belong to with different families
of whales have different songs.

97
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:35.820
So that's a starts to
get back to your question

98
00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.230
a little bit. That's that's
where you get into some

99
00:05:37.230 --> 00:05:39.750
of the road processing of
it. And then actually you

100
00:05:39.750 --> 00:05:42.360
can get into a even
deeper and more involved projects

101
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.780
from there. So you, you
gave the example of looking

102
00:05:45.780 --> 00:05:49.080
for, was it pulse pulsars?
Yes. Yeah. Pulse ours is

103
00:05:49.080 --> 00:05:52.710
another one. Yeah. So, so
how am I qualified to

104
00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:54.390
do that? I mean, you
have a master's in space

105
00:05:54.390 --> 00:05:56.730
studies. I went to a
community college. I feel like

106
00:05:56.730 --> 00:05:59.180
I would up their experiment.
Like I like to be

107
00:05:59.180 --> 00:06:01.550
involved, but I'd hate to
be the one that missed

108
00:06:01.550 --> 00:06:04.630
it or clicked on the
wrong star. Absolutely. That's a

109
00:06:04.630 --> 00:06:07.270
fear for everybody who, who
first gets into this. So

110
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:09.670
there are two aspects to
this one is that they

111
00:06:09.670 --> 00:06:13.030
have really, really good training.
They provide you with video

112
00:06:13.030 --> 00:06:15.580
training, they provide you with
tutorials. They, they walk you

113
00:06:15.580 --> 00:06:19.390
through everything. They explain the
science to it so that

114
00:06:19.390 --> 00:06:21.940
you know why it is
you're looking for this. They

115
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:24.220
do explain it in layman's
terms so that you're not

116
00:06:24.220 --> 00:06:27.550
sitting there trying to figure
out, you know, $20 words

117
00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.290
or, you know, find out
what it is they're talking

118
00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:32.320
about. So that's the first
part of it. The second

119
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.110
part of it is that
they have all of these

120
00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:38.740
different things broken down into
really, really simple tasks. So

121
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.180
for example, with, with one
called well with the whale,

122
00:06:43.180 --> 00:06:45.970
one, for example, you're just
listening to the sound and

123
00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:49.990
you're not trying to, you
know, retune the sound or

124
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.420
calibrate the sound or you
you're just listening at that

125
00:06:52.420 --> 00:06:54.940
point. So they've, they've got
it all broken out, but

126
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.190
the really important part, and
this is the third part

127
00:06:57.190 --> 00:06:59.500
is that you are not
the only person who's going

128
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:02.560
to be looking at that
particular data. So, you know,

129
00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.290
someone might see that particular
clip from whale FM, or

130
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.860
here at rather four or
five times. So your data

131
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:10.690
will be checked against the
next guys, which will be

132
00:07:10.690 --> 00:07:12.550
tacked against the next diet
should be checked against the

133
00:07:12.550 --> 00:07:14.140
next day. So even if
you happen to screw up

134
00:07:14.170 --> 00:07:16.000
one, or maybe even you
screw up 20 in a

135
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:18.400
row before you finally get
it, you know, it all

136
00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.440
gets cleaned up as more
and more people look at

137
00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:23.170
the same data. So you're
not going to cause us

138
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:25.870
to suddenly launch something that
shouldn't be launched or, or

139
00:07:25.870 --> 00:07:28.930
anything like that. It's all
good. So does this mean

140
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.390
that this is something that
I could get kids involved

141
00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:33.100
in? I wouldn't have to
worry about my nine year

142
00:07:33.100 --> 00:07:37.750
old messing up some important
space exploration. You can absolutely

143
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.000
get your kids involved. I
have my own children involved

144
00:07:40.960 --> 00:07:44.230
and they just love this
kind of stuff. There are,

145
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.210
even if you really want
to get your kids hooked

146
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:48.880
on this stuff, gamified versions
of this kind of thing.

147
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:51.970
So I've got on my
blog. There's a there's whole

148
00:07:51.970 --> 00:07:54.550
long list called the ultimate
guide to citizen science games,

149
00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:59.050
but on there. So for
example, there's one called click

150
00:07:59.050 --> 00:08:01.810
to cure and it's an
iPad game and you're running

151
00:08:01.810 --> 00:08:05.590
a little spaceship through space.
And every time you run

152
00:08:05.590 --> 00:08:08.080
through a particular part of
the, the game, your, your

153
00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:14.320
spaceship, you're helping to process
data on cancer, cancerous tumors,

154
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:18.250
and simply by playing the
game. And so there there's

155
00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:20.140
all kinds of ones like
that. There's also another one

156
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:23.770
called eternal and that's E
T E R N a.

157
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:28.810
And without one, it's a
beautiful, beautiful puzzle game where

158
00:08:28.810 --> 00:08:32.320
you have a string of
RNA and you're supposed to

159
00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.050
try and fold it according
to the rules that they

160
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.840
give you gorgeous games, look
at fun game to play

161
00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:41.110
somewhat addictive. And without when
you're helping to find the

162
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:44.080
ways that the, the ways
that RNA or ribonucleic acid

163
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.100
can bend and that'll help
us with finding drugs, good

164
00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:51.220
drug targets and good drug
candidates for helping cure diseases.

165
00:08:51.940 --> 00:08:55.740
So your, your kids can
definitely get into it. And

166
00:08:55.830 --> 00:08:58.310
is this, this is, This
may be a fullest question,

167
00:08:58.310 --> 00:09:00.710
but hopefully in citizen science,
there are no foolish questions.

168
00:09:01.070 --> 00:09:03.530
Is this really helping a
scientist? I mean, some of

169
00:09:03.530 --> 00:09:06.230
these are so polished, like,
you know, the, a cell

170
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:09.230
slider and click to cure
that it almost doesn't feel

171
00:09:09.230 --> 00:09:11.990
like I could be doing
something useful. Like it's just

172
00:09:11.990 --> 00:09:15.770
a really polished PR game.
Am I really providing data

173
00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:20.000
to these? You absolutely are.
If you want to let's,

174
00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.010
let's take it up a
notch. Let's go to some

175
00:09:22.010 --> 00:09:25.550
of the stuff where you're
actually out collecting data. So

176
00:09:25.550 --> 00:09:28.430
for a project Noah, they
want you to take your

177
00:09:28.430 --> 00:09:32.060
cell phone out and they
want you to take images

178
00:09:32.060 --> 00:09:35.420
of the flowers and the
insects and the birds and

179
00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:38.210
stuff like that in your
area and upload them to

180
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:41.060
the website. So with that,
what you're doing is you're

181
00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:46.010
helping scientists understand what animal
and bird populations are flourishing

182
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:49.700
and where a good example
of how that has actually

183
00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:55.400
changed scientific data. The camel
cricket in the United States, they

184
00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:57.710
recently put out a call
for everybody to see if

185
00:09:57.710 --> 00:10:00.380
they could find camel crickets
in their basements. And as

186
00:10:00.380 --> 00:10:02.810
it turned out, there were
more species than what we

187
00:10:02.810 --> 00:10:06.470
realized and that they had
spread further than what anybody

188
00:10:06.470 --> 00:10:09.230
knew. And this was simply
by getting everybody to go

189
00:10:09.230 --> 00:10:11.360
out and have a look.
So they were actually collecting

190
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.650
data for scientists rather than
just processing it and genuinely

191
00:10:15.650 --> 00:10:19.310
contributing to the, the, the
data that that needed to

192
00:10:19.310 --> 00:10:23.990
be had. And project Noah
at, at, at project noah.org

193
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:27.200
is extremely polished. You know,
you might, you might think

194
00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:30.110
you're on Instagram. It's, it's
that? Yes, it's, it's a

195
00:10:30.110 --> 00:10:32.300
really gorgeous thing to look
at. And the neat thing

196
00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:34.190
about it too, is that
you can almost get lost

197
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:37.760
in looking what everybody else
has posted. And you might

198
00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:40.100
even find stuff that you
didn't realize was there was

199
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:43.880
in your own neck of
the woods. So it seems

200
00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:47.660
like I could take my
kids out into our local

201
00:10:47.930 --> 00:10:51.170
open spaces and have them
really. And once they see

202
00:10:51.170 --> 00:10:53.210
what's going on in project
know, I hopefully that'll inspire

203
00:10:53.210 --> 00:10:57.200
them to, you know, take
well framed, clean photography, and

204
00:10:57.230 --> 00:11:00.620
maybe even identify some of
these flowers and origins. Absolutely.

205
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.080
Yeah. And they can take
a field guide out with

206
00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:07.130
them. I believe also project
Noah has some capacity for

207
00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.810
helping you to identify stuff
when you're out in the

208
00:11:08.810 --> 00:11:11.300
field. And even if you
don't know what it is,

209
00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:13.880
once you upload it, somebody,
I mean, the internet is

210
00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.560
so big and so huge.
There's, there's going to be

211
00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.320
an expert on something somewhere.
So even if you don't

212
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:19.670
know what it is, you're
looking at, somebody will be

213
00:11:19.670 --> 00:11:23.090
able to help you figure
it out. It's almost overwhelming

214
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:25.580
though. There's so many of
these different projects. I mean,

215
00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:29.090
if I were homeschooling my
kids, we could spend the

216
00:11:29.090 --> 00:11:32.300
whole year just trying a
different project every week and

217
00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.380
we'd still have hundreds of
projects. Yes. There are a

218
00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:39.650
huge number. So you would
have the chance to I,

219
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:41.270
as it is. I hope
I happen to homeschool my

220
00:11:41.270 --> 00:11:44.030
children. So we do use
this as, as part of

221
00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:47.000
our curriculum. And we've had
a good time going through

222
00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:48.710
some of these things and
each one of them touches

223
00:11:48.710 --> 00:11:52.730
on something different within our
curriculum. And the, and the

224
00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:54.880
nice is because I've got
a, an age range for

225
00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:56.470
my kids. I've got one,
two year old and I've

226
00:11:56.470 --> 00:11:58.180
got a 10 year old
and then two in between,

227
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.080
you can, you can tailor
it. And, and you know,

228
00:12:02.110 --> 00:12:03.490
the two year old can
look at the pictures and

229
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:06.220
go, Oh wow, that's kinda
cool. Whereas the 10 year

230
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:08.680
old can start reading the
scientific background of it. And

231
00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:10.570
then I'll send him off
to go look up some

232
00:12:10.570 --> 00:12:12.580
stuff on Wikipedia. And then
the eight year old can

233
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:15.250
actually do some of the
clicking on the images and

234
00:12:15.250 --> 00:12:17.350
then the five-year-old can do
something else. So you can,

235
00:12:17.350 --> 00:12:20.080
you can spend a lot
of time really digging into

236
00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:22.630
all facets of it. And,
and then the kids feel

237
00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:25.990
really neat because they're actually
doing something that's not just,

238
00:12:26.770 --> 00:12:29.290
you know, replicating the volcano
project for the science fair

239
00:12:29.290 --> 00:12:31.450
kind of thing. It's, it's,
it's not been done before.

240
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.430
They're actually doing something new
for somebody. And you've got

241
00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.390
a Kindle book, a short
book called be the change,

242
00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.430
saving the world with citizen
science. Would this be a

243
00:12:41.430 --> 00:12:44.670
good place for me to
start figuring out how Involved?

244
00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:47.580
Yeah, absolutely. I'm I made
all the links in there

245
00:12:47.850 --> 00:12:51.270
clickable so that you can
investigate some of these projects.

246
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.520
I have divided them up
in the same way that

247
00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:55.020
I've kind of talked about
here on the, on the

248
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.690
podcast, in terms of, you
know, how you can get

249
00:12:57.690 --> 00:13:00.300
started, how you can, you
know, your level of commitment,

250
00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:02.820
what, what it is you
need to do, how deep

251
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:04.830
you want to go. And
you can start by, you

252
00:13:04.830 --> 00:13:06.750
know, finding a couple that
you really like and donating,

253
00:13:06.750 --> 00:13:09.780
or you can dive right
in. I'll tell you that

254
00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.200
for the, for the homeschoolers,
there's one that is really

255
00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:15.900
cool. It's called shark finder.
And you get sent a

256
00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:19.620
vile of material sediment from
the ocean floor, and you

257
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:22.800
pick through it to look
for skate and Ray and

258
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:26.370
shark fossils. And so you
can actually do real time

259
00:13:26.370 --> 00:13:31.110
paleontology at your kitchen at
your kitchen table. We, we

260
00:13:31.110 --> 00:13:33.210
did a similar one. Yeah.
We did a similar one

261
00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:35.880
last year, my kids and
I called Mastodon matrix. Unfortunately

262
00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.590
that one's run out of
funding for the time being.

263
00:13:38.550 --> 00:13:40.710
But we were sent a,
a huge bag of dirt

264
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:44.580
actually from a Mastodon excavation
site. As we had the

265
00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:47.010
microscope out, we had the
tweezers out, we had the

266
00:13:47.010 --> 00:13:51.060
magnifying glass, they sent us
a little data sheet where

267
00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:52.800
you could figure out what
it is you were looking

268
00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:55.530
at. We found something that
we thought actually might be

269
00:13:55.530 --> 00:13:58.080
a Mastodon hair. So they
were very excited about that.

270
00:13:58.290 --> 00:14:01.710
Definitely a lot of shell
fragments without one, what we

271
00:14:01.710 --> 00:14:03.870
were doing was helping them
figure out what the world

272
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:06.120
was like, you know, 10,
11, thousand years ago, when

273
00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.080
mastodons were roaming about in,
in New Jersey. So it gave

274
00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.520
them a whole new perspective
on what it was like

275
00:14:11.520 --> 00:14:14.550
to do real science. Well,
it definitely gets them engaged

276
00:14:14.550 --> 00:14:16.170
in the, in the physicality
of it. A lot of

277
00:14:16.170 --> 00:14:18.900
these things are very abstract.
My kids are just now

278
00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:21.900
seven and nine and you
know, a million years ago

279
00:14:21.900 --> 00:14:24.360
is the, you know, the
mid eighties as far as

280
00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.240
they're concerned. So when they,
when they get to physically

281
00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:29.340
touch something, it definitely connects
them to science in a

282
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:31.890
way that didn't. Yeah. Yeah.
It's one thing to have

283
00:14:31.890 --> 00:14:33.900
them do stuff on their
iPad or they're on the

284
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.930
computer. It is quite another
to get them to actually

285
00:14:36.930 --> 00:14:40.380
get out in nature and
sunshine and looking for this

286
00:14:40.380 --> 00:14:41.880
kind of stuff. So it's,
it's a good way to

287
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:43.800
give your kids a well
rounded experience of the world

288
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:47.190
When you found this, these
things in the dirt. Are

289
00:14:47.190 --> 00:14:48.840
you, are you expected to
send that back to the

290
00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:51.650
scientist? If you found something
amazing in that, I assume

291
00:14:51.650 --> 00:14:53.980
that it's your responsibility to
send it back. Absolutely. Yeah.

292
00:14:53.990 --> 00:14:56.260
So what we did with
that project is we sorted

293
00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:58.750
everything into a little Ziploc
baggies. So we had a

294
00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:01.900
bag for plant material, a
bag for shell fragments, some

295
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:04.960
for stone bits, we even
found an algae spores. So

296
00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.030
we give that its own
little Ziploc bag. And then

297
00:15:07.030 --> 00:15:09.070
we packed up all the
stuff, even all the stuff

298
00:15:09.070 --> 00:15:10.930
that didn't look like it
was important and shipped all

299
00:15:10.930 --> 00:15:12.850
that back so that the
scientists will be able to,

300
00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:16.270
you know, take all of
the little specimens out and

301
00:15:16.270 --> 00:15:18.100
then put the, the rest
of the dirt back. And

302
00:15:18.610 --> 00:15:21.550
presumably maybe even have it
looked at again to see

303
00:15:21.550 --> 00:15:23.230
what else, what other stuff
we missed. Cause I mean,

304
00:15:23.230 --> 00:15:25.390
inevitably when you've got little
kids around, you're not going

305
00:15:25.390 --> 00:15:27.250
to catch it all. There's
only so much patients, some

306
00:15:27.250 --> 00:15:30.940
of the little ones have,
That's such a, that's such

307
00:15:30.940 --> 00:15:33.520
a, I want to say
a metaphor, but just the

308
00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.480
idea of like, well, some
people are getting Netflix, other

309
00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:39.790
people are getting dirt that
they can sort through. You

310
00:15:39.790 --> 00:15:41.920
know what I mean? There's
this, there's this metaphor on

311
00:15:41.980 --> 00:15:44.080
what we're doing, like as
a Western culture right now.

312
00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:47.080
Like why aren't we doing
things like this more at

313
00:15:47.080 --> 00:15:49.510
a larger scale, you know,
for every one bag of

314
00:15:49.510 --> 00:15:52.930
dirt filled with Mastodon hairs,
there's probably 10,000 DVDs being

315
00:15:52.930 --> 00:15:57.670
sent out with episodes of,
you know, Nickelodeon shows. Yeah.

316
00:15:57.700 --> 00:15:59.890
Yeah. The sir. But the
neat thing about living in

317
00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:02.500
this age though, is that
something like the Mastodon matrix

318
00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:05.650
is possible. One of the
reasons why citizen science is

319
00:16:05.650 --> 00:16:08.230
becoming a big thing now,
and wasn't so much when

320
00:16:08.230 --> 00:16:11.170
I first started looking at
this about 10 years ago

321
00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.860
is that the internet has
enabled so much of this

322
00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:17.830
kind of thing. It's allowed
for a site like project

323
00:16:17.830 --> 00:16:22.350
Noah. We put together fairly
cheaply, fairly quickly, the, the,

324
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:24.070
the templates and stuff like
that, you can get to

325
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.170
set up a website to
make it look really gorgeous.

326
00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:29.560
All of that kind of
stuff is, is orders of

327
00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:32.830
magnitude cheaper than it was
10 years ago. And even

328
00:16:32.830 --> 00:16:35.640
it's even the case that
more and more people are

329
00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:38.380
interested in this kind of
thing, because we're so connected

330
00:16:38.380 --> 00:16:41.170
these days. And we're starting
to realize, Hey, what happens

331
00:16:41.170 --> 00:16:44.260
here in the United States affects
the kids over in China.

332
00:16:44.530 --> 00:16:48.660
And it affects the people
in Japan. You know, it's

333
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:52.930
even the case that when
we had that massive tsunami

334
00:16:52.930 --> 00:16:55.480
there in Japan a few
years ago, I'm a citizen

335
00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:58.750
science project came out of
that because someone said, Hey,

336
00:16:59.260 --> 00:17:00.790
this is something I want
to be able to do

337
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:02.530
something about, and I don't
want to just send over

338
00:17:02.530 --> 00:17:05.380
money. So this fellow got
together with some of his

339
00:17:05.380 --> 00:17:09.310
other programmers and friends and,
and hardware specialists. And they

340
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:13.210
put together radiation sensors that
they strapped everybody's car in,

341
00:17:13.370 --> 00:17:17.230
in Japan. It was called,
I believe Safecast. Yeah. And

342
00:17:17.230 --> 00:17:21.040
so they now have this
roving network of radiation sensors

343
00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:24.730
right within the, the area
that Fukushima was a where

344
00:17:24.730 --> 00:17:28.810
Fukushima is having problems still
to this day. And you

345
00:17:28.810 --> 00:17:30.880
know, they've, they've got this
network so people can get

346
00:17:30.880 --> 00:17:34.390
real time data. They can
get information that they don't

347
00:17:34.390 --> 00:17:36.700
have to depend on their
government for, which is another,

348
00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.690
another big thing. And they
were able to do something

349
00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:42.940
just because the tools are
there and so cheap. And

350
00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.890
if anybody's got a little
bit of initiative, they can

351
00:17:44.890 --> 00:17:48.880
go and do something That
is such a, there's so

352
00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:50.460
many buzz words that plug
into that as far as

353
00:17:50.460 --> 00:17:52.200
like big data and the
internet of things, you know,

354
00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.020
if these kinds of sensors
were already in our iPhones

355
00:17:55.020 --> 00:17:59.190
or in our cars and
the privacy concerns could be

356
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:04.560
allayed. One could ask the
world questions, you know, like

357
00:18:04.770 --> 00:18:07.170
give me a heat map
of radiation in this area.

358
00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:10.140
Or, you know, whether it
be the example you gave

359
00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:11.790
of radiation, you know, of
course we're doing things like

360
00:18:11.790 --> 00:18:14.910
that with traffic now, weather
data at a, at a,

361
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.550
both a micro and a
macro level could be, could

362
00:18:17.550 --> 00:18:20.000
be explored. We're starting to
get into that a little

363
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:22.910
bit with all the, the
mobile phones and so forth.

364
00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:24.830
Even with the basic sensors
they do have, I'll give

365
00:18:24.830 --> 00:18:28.070
you two examples. One is
called the loss of the

366
00:18:28.070 --> 00:18:31.250
night. And with that one,
you take it outside. You

367
00:18:31.250 --> 00:18:33.230
have a look and see
what stars you can see

368
00:18:33.230 --> 00:18:36.290
in your local area and
compare that to what you

369
00:18:36.290 --> 00:18:38.420
should be able to see
on the screen. And that

370
00:18:38.420 --> 00:18:41.030
one gives them an idea
of what light pollution is

371
00:18:41.030 --> 00:18:43.820
like in various spots in,
in North America and all

372
00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.820
around the rest of the
world. Another one is kind

373
00:18:46.820 --> 00:18:51.290
of like four square for
Junkin and litter. It's called

374
00:18:51.290 --> 00:18:56.030
Murray Marine debris finder. And
with that one in, I

375
00:18:56.030 --> 00:18:58.430
believe this one is set
in California mainly, but I'm

376
00:18:58.430 --> 00:19:02.180
sure it'll expand, but people,
when they see junk and

377
00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:05.420
trash near waterways, they can
go on this app and

378
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.520
they can click what they
see and, you know, check

379
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.880
in. And that will give
the people who look after

380
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.250
these waterways, a good indication
of where they need to

381
00:19:13.250 --> 00:19:15.470
go. Instead of just going
to a waterway that doesn't

382
00:19:15.470 --> 00:19:17.630
happen to have anything in
it and waste the time

383
00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:19.790
and money to go out
there. They can go to

384
00:19:19.790 --> 00:19:21.820
where there's a problem and
go clean it up and

385
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.710
spend a lot less time
and money doing. So all

386
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:26.960
kinds of applications with that
sort of thing, just with

387
00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:31.240
mobile apps. Sure. Do you
think that this is, is

388
00:19:31.250 --> 00:19:34.100
hitting or is even close
to hitting mainstream? Cause I

389
00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:36.350
feel like, you know, for
every cool project that the

390
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.650
one you just described, there
are a million geocasher is

391
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.470
out there that are just
leaving chotsky in boxes and

392
00:19:42.470 --> 00:19:45.710
then looking for Trotsky inboxes,
like they're not actually accomplishing

393
00:19:45.710 --> 00:19:50.450
anything. There's there's, there's, we're,
we're coming up to, I

394
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:55.250
think, more public awareness of
the citizen science movement. In

395
00:19:55.250 --> 00:19:58.850
the last two years, I
have seen more mainstream coverage

396
00:19:58.910 --> 00:20:01.610
of citizen science things than
I have in the, in

397
00:20:01.610 --> 00:20:05.540
the previous eight years. And
I think there is real

398
00:20:05.540 --> 00:20:10.340
scope for tapping into the
geocaches for tapping into star

399
00:20:10.340 --> 00:20:13.070
Trek fans, just as a,
as a, an example. I

400
00:20:13.070 --> 00:20:15.170
mean, you have all these
people who spend so much

401
00:20:15.170 --> 00:20:17.360
time and so much money
going to star Trek conventions,

402
00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:20.540
and, and learning how to
speak, cling on. And, and,

403
00:20:20.930 --> 00:20:22.610
and you know, that that's
a lot of fun and

404
00:20:22.610 --> 00:20:24.050
I understand why people do
it. It's a way to

405
00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:27.470
get social. It's a way
to meet likeminded people. And,

406
00:20:27.470 --> 00:20:29.240
you know, we don't always
have to be serious all

407
00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:33.020
the time, but there is
obviously a huge untapped reservoir

408
00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:39.710
of creative energy clay Shirky
calls it cognitive surplus. And

409
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:41.660
we, we have all this
brain power and far more

410
00:20:41.660 --> 00:20:44.240
spare time than we're willing
to admit. And even if

411
00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:47.710
we can just start tapping
into a small percentage, that

412
00:20:48.340 --> 00:20:50.800
all kinds of things could
be done and we can

413
00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:54.120
make real signals, You can
progress. That's a really great

414
00:20:54.120 --> 00:20:56.220
way to put it. I
mean, we do, you know,

415
00:20:56.230 --> 00:20:58.380
as much as there are
many people are struggling and

416
00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:00.360
there are difficulties and there
are big problems in the

417
00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.540
world at the same time,
there are people in basically

418
00:21:03.540 --> 00:21:06.780
anyone listening to this podcast
and anyone who has a

419
00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.020
mobile phone that have more
time on their hands than

420
00:21:10.020 --> 00:21:12.390
perhaps that they realize. And
that can be put to

421
00:21:12.390 --> 00:21:15.210
extremely good use with just
a little bit of focus.

422
00:21:15.450 --> 00:21:19.860
Yep. Absolutely. And one of
the things too, I just

423
00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:21.510
read a book called the
second machine age. I forget

424
00:21:21.510 --> 00:21:28.350
the author's name, but they
talk about how technology progresses

425
00:21:28.350 --> 00:21:32.910
and movements, progress, you know,
slowly incrementally to start with.

426
00:21:32.910 --> 00:21:34.560
And then all of a
sudden they hit this critical

427
00:21:34.560 --> 00:21:37.240
mass and they're doing all
kinds of things. And it's,

428
00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.690
it's kind of like, you
know, the old story about

429
00:21:39.930 --> 00:21:42.180
someone putting a penny on
a chess board and then

430
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:43.710
they double it the next
day. And then they double

431
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:46.260
it the next day and,
you know, four pennies, eight

432
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:49.320
pennies, 16 pennies. And it,
it, it seems like such

433
00:21:49.320 --> 00:21:51.480
a small amount, but then
by the time you, you

434
00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:53.520
know, you start doubling that
again and again, and again,

435
00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:54.630
by the time you get
down to the end of

436
00:21:54.630 --> 00:21:57.210
the chess board, you've got
thousands and thousands of dollars

437
00:21:57.210 --> 00:21:59.070
on the board, and it's
not until you hit that

438
00:21:59.070 --> 00:22:02.730
critical point in the doubling
that, that, that suddenly starts

439
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.130
to explode. And we're coming
to that point, I think

440
00:22:05.130 --> 00:22:08.040
now that the famous tipping
point where we're, we're going

441
00:22:08.040 --> 00:22:10.440
to start to see some
huge progress in a lot

442
00:22:10.440 --> 00:22:13.850
of different fronts Implying that
the singularity is around and,

443
00:22:13.850 --> 00:22:16.290
and, and of course then
Skynet or just around the,

444
00:22:16.590 --> 00:22:20.370
Yeah, they may well be
The second machine age is

445
00:22:20.550 --> 00:22:23.520
Erik Brynjolfsson and annual ma
Andrew McAfee. And it happens

446
00:22:23.520 --> 00:22:25.710
actually just to be the
number one book in business

447
00:22:25.710 --> 00:22:28.530
development on Amazon right now.
So definitely someone people should

448
00:22:28.530 --> 00:22:30.960
check that out. One of
the things that I wanted

449
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.450
to take a look at
was you write a number

450
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:37.350
of articles for popular science,
and recently wrote one about

451
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:41.640
an organization called the open
space agency. And I wanted

452
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.280
to ask someone who knew
about space and understood the,

453
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.400
you know, kind of the
larger system that you, that

454
00:22:47.400 --> 00:22:51.900
you understand is it becoming
cheaper to, and as such

455
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.360
feasible to get into space,
it seems like we got

456
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.280
tomorrow's a lot cheaper than
we got to the moon.

457
00:22:57.090 --> 00:23:00.630
Yeah. I mean, obviously the
big projects where we're launching

458
00:23:00.630 --> 00:23:04.230
probes and, and launching rockets
and so forth, those are

459
00:23:04.230 --> 00:23:06.540
still pretty expensive. It's still
costs in the order of,

460
00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:09.030
you know, $10,000 a pound
to get something into space

461
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:13.110
that said, we have a
lot more people applying their

462
00:23:13.110 --> 00:23:17.370
brains to it. We have,
now India's trying to send

463
00:23:17.370 --> 00:23:19.350
things up. China is trying
to send things up. It's

464
00:23:19.350 --> 00:23:22.560
not just down to the
Americans and the Russians. And

465
00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.000
also because certain components of
space exploration, like the sensors,

466
00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.240
like the hardware, like the
information about how to build

467
00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:33.210
this kind of thing, those
things are becoming cheaper and

468
00:23:33.210 --> 00:23:35.070
far more widely available. So
you're going to see a

469
00:23:35.070 --> 00:23:40.830
lot more attempts to, to
do this by private citizens.

470
00:23:42.090 --> 00:23:44.220
This, this, this in itself
might cause some problems. If

471
00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:46.000
we're all trying to launch
something the same time, we

472
00:23:46.010 --> 00:23:49.100
might have a few traffic
issues, but you know, we're,

473
00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:51.530
we're getting to the point
where yes, it's becoming cheaper

474
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.750
to do it. And I
think it's not going to

475
00:23:53.750 --> 00:23:57.620
be the sole provenance of,
of very well funded government

476
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.060
governments. And one of the
examples that you gave in

477
00:24:01.060 --> 00:24:05.290
your article was that bringing
the price of entry to

478
00:24:05.860 --> 00:24:10.150
exploring space as an amateur
astronomer is potentially coming down

479
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.090
by an order of magnitude
or a few orders of

480
00:24:13.090 --> 00:24:18.160
magnitude people putting together fairly
reasonable devices for doing observations

481
00:24:18.230 --> 00:24:21.940
in space with, with mobile
phones and raspberry pies. Yeah.

482
00:24:22.480 --> 00:24:24.250
One of the things that
open space agency, one of

483
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:27.760
their first projects is to
build a, a astronomy quality

484
00:24:28.930 --> 00:24:32.800
telescope and then open source
the plans so that, you

485
00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.080
know, if anybody, you know,
obviously back in the day

486
00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.840
when somebody wanted to go
and build a telescope, even

487
00:24:37.840 --> 00:24:40.450
in Kepler's time or Galileo's
time, they would have to

488
00:24:40.450 --> 00:24:43.330
go to a specific, you
know, specialist in and to

489
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:45.100
someone to grind the lenses
and someone to do this.

490
00:24:45.100 --> 00:24:48.760
And somebody that these days
with the advent of things

491
00:24:48.760 --> 00:24:50.980
like three D printing and
where you can just send

492
00:24:50.980 --> 00:24:54.630
a way for quality lenses
from a supply shop and,

493
00:24:54.630 --> 00:24:57.220
and this, that, and the
other, anybody with a, you

494
00:24:57.220 --> 00:24:59.230
know, the slightest bit of
tinkering ability should be able

495
00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:02.980
to put something together that,
that works pretty well. And,

496
00:25:02.980 --> 00:25:04.030
you know, even if they
don't get it right, the

497
00:25:04.030 --> 00:25:07.030
first time that there's communities
building up around these things

498
00:25:07.030 --> 00:25:08.920
where they can say, Hey,
it does this, or whatever

499
00:25:08.920 --> 00:25:10.930
they wrong, or why is
it showing everything the wrong

500
00:25:10.930 --> 00:25:13.660
way up or, or whatever.
And they'll be able to

501
00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:15.400
get some help with that
kind of thing. Just like

502
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.880
with any other community these
days. Yeah. I've said it

503
00:25:18.880 --> 00:25:21.010
in, in previous shows that
I feel like we are

504
00:25:21.010 --> 00:25:24.160
abstracting on the shoulders of
giants. You know, like people

505
00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.490
don't even realize how much
had to happen in the

506
00:25:27.490 --> 00:25:30.160
world and in science for
there to be a 41

507
00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:34.570
megapixel CCD on a, on
a consumer grade camera. Now

508
00:25:34.570 --> 00:25:36.730
the idea that someone can
plug those things in together

509
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.250
with an Arduino. And, and
now I have, you know,

510
00:25:39.280 --> 00:25:43.510
a prosumer quality device that
I can look at space

511
00:25:43.510 --> 00:25:46.480
with abstinence. Yeah. One of
the things I like to

512
00:25:46.480 --> 00:25:48.850
do, and when I tear
down a computer or, or,

513
00:25:49.600 --> 00:25:51.010
you know, go to put
some new component in or

514
00:25:51.010 --> 00:25:52.930
whatever is, and I take
a second and I look

515
00:25:52.930 --> 00:25:55.360
at everything that in there,
and you think about all

516
00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.040
the knowledge that had to
go before you to put

517
00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:00.250
that together and metallurgy and
plastics and, and electronics and

518
00:26:00.250 --> 00:26:03.550
physics and, and everything that
had to go together into

519
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.860
something. You know, even if
you just look inside your,

520
00:26:05.860 --> 00:26:08.440
your smartphone and that's something
that everybody has in their

521
00:26:08.440 --> 00:26:11.590
pockets, even increasingly in third
world countries, these are, these

522
00:26:11.590 --> 00:26:15.700
are rapidly being adopted. We
have more power in the

523
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:17.440
Palm of our hands than
the one actually took us

524
00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:21.100
to the moon back in
19 in the 1960s. So

525
00:26:21.100 --> 00:26:23.500
it's just incredible how this
is, has changed in the

526
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:26.500
last few years, Which brings
me again, back to my

527
00:26:26.500 --> 00:26:28.510
point of why we're not
in the moon right now,

528
00:26:28.510 --> 00:26:30.820
it really comes down less
to processing power and more

529
00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.550
to the physicality of moving
a pound of anything or

530
00:26:33.550 --> 00:26:36.220
a kilo of anything out
of orbit. Yes. Yes. And

531
00:26:36.220 --> 00:26:39.430
it also comes down to
too political will. I think

532
00:26:39.430 --> 00:26:41.680
one of the reasons why
we went to went in

533
00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.950
his face in the first
place is of the cold

534
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:48.360
war, possibly. If, you know,
if the Russians hadn't chucked,

535
00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:52.080
Sputnik up there and scared
everybody to bits, we might

536
00:26:52.080 --> 00:26:54.570
not be as far ahead
on that. Then, you know,

537
00:26:54.970 --> 00:26:57.330
we, we are now and
we, we might've actually been

538
00:26:57.330 --> 00:27:00.210
there earlier than what would
have been otherwise had there

539
00:27:00.210 --> 00:27:02.490
not been a cold war,
hard to say, you know,

540
00:27:02.490 --> 00:27:04.680
you could write all kinds
of cool alternative history stories

541
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:07.880
about that, but, you know,
That's the way it is.

542
00:27:08.930 --> 00:27:10.820
Do you find it more
amazing that we made it

543
00:27:10.820 --> 00:27:13.070
there with the technology of
the time or more amazing

544
00:27:13.070 --> 00:27:15.710
that we made it back?
Definitely that we made it

545
00:27:15.710 --> 00:27:18.140
back. The fact that we
were able to put so

546
00:27:18.140 --> 00:27:20.870
many people up there that,
you know, it, it became

547
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:22.700
commonplace and it's even the
case that we, we put

548
00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:25.940
so many shuttles up that,
you know, people would say,

549
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.280
Oh yeah, okay. The shuttle
launch. Okay. Big deal. You

550
00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:32.930
know, it, it became such
a non-news event, unfortunately, until

551
00:27:32.930 --> 00:27:36.050
we had a couple of
tragedies on that score. It's

552
00:27:36.050 --> 00:27:37.730
good that we got to
the point where it was

553
00:27:37.730 --> 00:27:40.520
a, a standard thing, but
it's also sad that we

554
00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.310
lost kind of the, the
magic and the all, and

555
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.740
the wonder of that, that
era. I really wish we

556
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:47.660
did have that because I
mean, we not had a

557
00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:52.430
moon landing in 40 plus
years now, so yeah, it's,

558
00:27:52.430 --> 00:27:55.280
it's, I wish we had
more of that. It gives

559
00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:59.780
people a bigger sense of
themselves, Bigger picture. What can,

560
00:27:59.780 --> 00:28:01.850
what can my listeners do?
What can I do as

561
00:28:01.850 --> 00:28:04.400
more of a software person
in the, in the, in

562
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.860
the context of citizen science,
perhaps, maybe an open source,

563
00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:09.470
citizen science, absolutely. A couple
of things you can do.

564
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:11.750
First of all, I, a
lot of these projects are

565
00:28:11.750 --> 00:28:15.740
looking for people to donate
time and programming experience. And

566
00:28:16.310 --> 00:28:18.700
a lot of these things
are university funded, so that

567
00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:21.440
they're always looking for help.
That way, if you're interested

568
00:28:21.440 --> 00:28:24.980
in something, starting something on
your own, there is a,

569
00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:27.590
an open source framework for
this called PI Basa. And

570
00:28:27.590 --> 00:28:33.380
you can find that@pybossa.com. So
there's a framework for doing

571
00:28:33.380 --> 00:28:37.820
crowd sourcing for citizen science,
for any number of things.

572
00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:41.330
And you can write your
own program, you can start

573
00:28:41.330 --> 00:28:45.110
collecting data, you can get
people involved. So that's a

574
00:28:45.110 --> 00:28:47.810
good way for anybody with
some programming skill to, to

575
00:28:47.810 --> 00:28:51.410
really get into it. Sure.
So it looks like pie.

576
00:28:51.410 --> 00:28:54.440
Basa is like you say,
it's a, it's a platform

577
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.360
for one to crowd source.
So if I know a

578
00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:58.430
scientist or I know someone
who wants to do science,

579
00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:01.550
they can use PI Bossar
to crowd source things. And

580
00:29:01.550 --> 00:29:03.260
if I know about software,
I can get involved with

581
00:29:03.260 --> 00:29:06.670
a project like this, make
some pull requests and, and

582
00:29:06.830 --> 00:29:09.620
maybe make tools that They
don't already have. Yep, exactly.

583
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.110
They're also using it. If
you scroll down a bit

584
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:13.580
on that site and it
talks a little bit about

585
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.060
civic hacking, that's another application
for this, where we're trying

586
00:29:17.060 --> 00:29:20.510
to improve our cities. A
really generic example of how

587
00:29:20.510 --> 00:29:23.720
that could be used is
like a pothole reporter put

588
00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:27.560
together something for your local
municipality to have them be

589
00:29:27.560 --> 00:29:31.340
able to report in, on
potholes in the area and

590
00:29:31.670 --> 00:29:34.580
have your local municipality spend
less time, you know, searching

591
00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.320
for the things and more
time finding out which ones

592
00:29:36.320 --> 00:29:37.940
are the priority and which
ones are really getting under

593
00:29:37.940 --> 00:29:40.580
people's axles and, and bugging
them, you know, there there's

594
00:29:40.580 --> 00:29:45.670
all kinds, stuff like that.
It's also more and more

595
00:29:45.670 --> 00:29:49.090
people are using this kind
of thing for activism. I'm

596
00:29:49.090 --> 00:29:51.040
sure a lot of your
listeners are familiar with movie

597
00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.850
Erin Brockovich, or at least
heard about it. Imagine if

598
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:56.740
the kind of tools that
we now have available for

599
00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:59.920
doing water sampling for doing
air testing for doing any

600
00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:02.020
of that kind of thing,
we're available to an activist

601
00:30:02.020 --> 00:30:07.090
like Erin Brockovich, how much
we could push back when

602
00:30:07.090 --> 00:30:10.990
things like spills and air
pollution and dumping happen, you

603
00:30:10.990 --> 00:30:13.090
could, you can find, you
don't have to rely on

604
00:30:13.090 --> 00:30:15.910
a testing agency where you,
you might doubt whether they're

605
00:30:15.910 --> 00:30:17.740
actually on your side or
providing you with the real

606
00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:20.440
data. You could go get
it yourself, all kinds of

607
00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:24.310
applications available for, for that
kind of stuff at your

608
00:30:24.310 --> 00:30:27.760
website, citizen science center.com on
the right hand side. I

609
00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.040
really like the section. How
can I get involved? Because

610
00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:33.550
you've broken it down into
levels. And it's basically, you

611
00:30:33.550 --> 00:30:35.440
know, this is my words,
you know, it's levels of

612
00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.880
how much do I want
to get off my butt?

613
00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:40.930
You know, level one, donate,
you know, level to install

614
00:30:40.930 --> 00:30:42.730
this, set it and forget
it. And then all the

615
00:30:42.730 --> 00:30:44.890
way up to levels, five
and six, where I actually

616
00:30:44.890 --> 00:30:47.410
have to leave the house
really like your, your six

617
00:30:47.410 --> 00:30:49.810
levels of citizen science. Thank
you. As one of the

618
00:30:49.810 --> 00:30:52.120
reasons. I mean, because there
are so many projects and

619
00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:56.080
more coming out pretty much
every day, it's, it's hard

620
00:30:56.080 --> 00:30:58.030
for anybody to know where
to start and, and it

621
00:30:58.030 --> 00:31:00.370
can seem very overwhelming. So
I wanted to break it

622
00:31:00.370 --> 00:31:01.990
down and in a way
that people could, you know,

623
00:31:01.990 --> 00:31:03.880
dip their toes in a
little bit, maybe play with

624
00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:06.430
it a little bit and
try and go from there.

625
00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.560
And, and then, you know,
you can work your way

626
00:31:08.560 --> 00:31:11.590
up. And one of the
questions that does come up

627
00:31:11.590 --> 00:31:13.810
to when, when people are
looking for this as well.

628
00:31:13.810 --> 00:31:16.600
Okay, fine. But what's in
it for me, apart from,

629
00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.880
you know, being able to
tackle some of the problems

630
00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.290
that are then going to
be problems for my kids

631
00:31:20.290 --> 00:31:23.410
and my grandkids. So if
you're, if you're looking for

632
00:31:23.410 --> 00:31:26.470
that little extra motivation, some
of these projects, they have

633
00:31:26.470 --> 00:31:29.710
leaderboards and scoreboards, just like
you would with any of

634
00:31:29.710 --> 00:31:33.550
the games that you play,
Farmville and all that kind

635
00:31:33.550 --> 00:31:36.260
of good stuff on Facebook,
they have leaderboards and, and

636
00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:41.200
score, score, keeping that way.
Some of the papers that

637
00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:43.870
are produced do actually list
all the participants. Some of

638
00:31:43.870 --> 00:31:46.720
the smaller projects, obviously some
of the bigger projects where

639
00:31:46.720 --> 00:31:48.340
they have hundreds of thousands
of people that would be

640
00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:50.710
somewhat impractical, but they do
get credit on the website.

641
00:31:51.730 --> 00:31:54.460
And for some of the
astronomy based ones, you might

642
00:31:54.460 --> 00:31:57.130
even get naming rights. If
you happen to discover something

643
00:31:57.130 --> 00:32:00.400
like an extra solar planet
or a pulsar or a

644
00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.490
galaxy, you have, you know,
you may be able to

645
00:32:03.490 --> 00:32:06.490
see your name in lights
quite literally. So again, get

646
00:32:06.490 --> 00:32:08.410
out there and give it
a go. That was very,

647
00:32:08.410 --> 00:32:10.900
very cool. I would encourage
everyone to check out citizen

648
00:32:10.910 --> 00:32:14.440
science center.com and all of
the really great resources that

649
00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:17.590
are up there. You've got
books, your book, and others

650
00:32:17.590 --> 00:32:18.790
that people can take a
look at it. You can

651
00:32:18.790 --> 00:32:22.150
subscribe for free and get
involved in citizen science. Thanks

652
00:32:22.150 --> 00:32:24.580
so much for chatting with
me today. My pleasure. I

653
00:32:24.580 --> 00:32:26.560
hope, I hope I tweak
the interest of a lot

654
00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.140
of people out there. This
has been another episode of

655
00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:31.090
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
