Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.

8
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:48.240
This is another episode of
Hansel minutes today. I'm chatting

9
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.850
with Angela bossa. She's the
director of data science at

10
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:54.530
I robot. And how are
you today? I'm great. Scott,

11
00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:57.260
how are you? I am
very happy to be chatting

12
00:00:57.260 --> 00:00:59.750
with you. I understand that
you were just in Portland,

13
00:00:59.750 --> 00:01:01.640
but I missed you by
a couple of weeks. What

14
00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:04.550
were you doing in Portland?
Yeah, so I was there

15
00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:09.140
for a CSV comp, which
is a data science conference

16
00:01:09.170 --> 00:01:12.920
that's community run, and it
taught a lot of folks

17
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:15.380
talk about open data and
the wonderful things they do

18
00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.490
with it. That was really
fun. CSV cough. This is

19
00:01:19.490 --> 00:01:23.210
a like, is it comma
separated, values comp? It is.

20
00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:28.220
It is. In fact it's
CSV, comma conch. Although I

21
00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:31.280
think the website is just
CSV, confe.org, if I'm not

22
00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.160
mistaken and, and it's run
by some folks out of

23
00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:42.710
Portland and Berkeley. So I
definitely recommend they are not,

24
00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:45.290
it's not an annual conference.
I'm not sure when their

25
00:01:45.290 --> 00:01:48.740
next edition will be, but
I recommend folks who are

26
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.370
interested in, in open data
work to check it out.

27
00:01:52.940 --> 00:01:54.770
That's very cool. I love
that name, that I think

28
00:01:54.770 --> 00:01:57.980
that's the coolest conference name
I've heard since notepad cough.

29
00:01:58.550 --> 00:02:03.980
It's just like, cool. Yeah,
that sounds like a great

30
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.820
name. Exactly. So you're a,
you're a data scientist, but

31
00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:11.180
when I look at your,
your LinkedIn, as we always

32
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:13.610
do, we always looking at
each other's LinkedIn's. I see

33
00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:18.830
that I'm seeing background in
math and not in programming.

34
00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:21.010
Do you identify as a
programmer or are you, what

35
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:22.940
is it, how does a
data scientist, a mathematician and

36
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:25.910
a programmer come together? What's
that Venn diagram look like?

37
00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:30.080
Yeah, the Venn diagram. So,
so I am not a

38
00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:32.780
programmer or at least I
don't consider myself one, I

39
00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:35.570
have written programs, but it's
sort of the same way

40
00:02:35.570 --> 00:02:38.000
that, you know, I have
sung karaoke, but I would

41
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.250
never consider myself a singer.
It's sort of a, the

42
00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:47.150
analogy that I work with.
So I have written programs.

43
00:02:47.180 --> 00:02:50.330
And in, in, when you're
working in data science, there's

44
00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:55.280
sort of this semantic exercise
of what is data science

45
00:02:55.700 --> 00:03:01.120
that, that placates pretty much
every conversation where two data

46
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:06.040
scientists by whatever definition are
together. And, and a lot

47
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:09.280
of folks say, you know,
it's, it's the overlap of,

48
00:03:09.310 --> 00:03:13.930
of domain expertise, computer science
skills and math and statistics

49
00:03:13.930 --> 00:03:17.470
skills. And that's totally true,
which is why I am

50
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.230
a recovering data scientist, but
I am now management because

51
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.930
there are people who have
much better hone skills in

52
00:03:28.930 --> 00:03:32.500
the, in, in the programming
arena. And what I find

53
00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.230
that I bring to the
table is, is the language

54
00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:38.740
component. It's the translation where
I can speak, you know,

55
00:03:38.740 --> 00:03:44.560
business and, and legalese and
securities and data and math.

56
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:48.220
And I can speak programming,
even if I can't do

57
00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:50.620
it super well. I know
the music theory behind it.

58
00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:54.130
I know the circle of
fifths. I just, I can't

59
00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:57.690
hold a pitch kind of
thing. Interesting. That makes me

60
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:00.600
wonder, I should probably have
a conductor and orchestra person

61
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:02.340
on the show sometime and
find out if they know

62
00:04:02.340 --> 00:04:06.030
how to play a musical
instrument or just, just wave

63
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.580
their arms in an appropriate
way that works for everyone.

64
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.260
Exactly. So when did you
discover data science? If you

65
00:04:13.260 --> 00:04:19.110
started out doing math, You
know, I discovered data science

66
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:27.540
under that moniker probably around
2013 or yeah, 2013, 2014

67
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:30.330
is when I learned of
the word. It's sort of

68
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:32.850
interesting when you talk to
people, you know, what is

69
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.940
accounting? What does an accountant
do? You know, there's been

70
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.160
accounting for probably hundreds of
years, you know, lawyers, doctors,

71
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.560
those are professions that if
they're in an organization, you

72
00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:46.350
sort of know where they
go data science. It's, it's

73
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.550
very recent. I think the
first time that the, the

74
00:04:49.580 --> 00:04:52.440
word was, was used in
print was in the late

75
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:57.480
fifties and some military manual
of some kind. So, so

76
00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:01.680
I heard the term very
late in the game. At

77
00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:05.760
that point, I had already
been, you know, a professional

78
00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.990
nerd in some capacity for,
for quite a while. And,

79
00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:14.160
and I, I learned of
it when I was working

80
00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:20.250
in marketing and programmatic marketing
after having spent almost a

81
00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.740
decade in, in strategy consulting
and so throughout. So, so

82
00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:28.380
my math degree, I employed
it in all sorts of

83
00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:31.680
ways until I learned that,
that I had some agency,

84
00:05:31.830 --> 00:05:35.010
I sort of felt like
on a conveyor belt, I

85
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:39.270
got recruited into re very
nice jobs and investment banking

86
00:05:39.270 --> 00:05:42.150
and whatnot. And it just
wasn't something that I was,

87
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.110
I felt passionate about when
I worked with, with the

88
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.410
marketing data. It was so
large, there was so much

89
00:05:49.410 --> 00:05:52.740
of it. It was, you
know, there were unstructured and

90
00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:55.200
that's sort of, at that
point is when I learned

91
00:05:55.410 --> 00:06:00.020
the, the nomenclature and the
jargon. And then that's when

92
00:06:00.020 --> 00:06:02.420
I decided this is the
profession that I really want

93
00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.570
to go into. And so
I did a couple of,

94
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:09.320
I had a couple of
roles after that. And then

95
00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:13.760
I went into management because
programming a computer is really,

96
00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:18.440
really fun, but programming humans
is really fun. And, you

97
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.510
know, you can pay somebody
to keep a seat warm,

98
00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:22.760
but you can't pay somebody
to think and solve a

99
00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.950
problem. So you're as passionate
about math and data science,

100
00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:29.500
as you are about leadership
and keeping people excited about

101
00:06:29.500 --> 00:06:32.590
their jobs. I really am.
I really am. I think

102
00:06:32.590 --> 00:06:35.950
that's, that's where my Venn
diagram of the things that

103
00:06:35.950 --> 00:06:37.960
I'm good at, the things
that the world needs and

104
00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.750
the things that I didn't
get paid to do sort

105
00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:43.270
of overlap. Would you call
that kind of a non

106
00:06:43.270 --> 00:06:46.390
traditional path into the, into
the tech industry and then

107
00:06:46.390 --> 00:06:48.340
becoming the, you know, the
director and the team lead

108
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:53.020
of a group Into the
tech industry, certainly into data

109
00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:56.680
science, into data science? No,
because I'm not sure there

110
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.860
exists a traditional path. Hmm.
That's a good point. It

111
00:06:59.860 --> 00:07:03.250
hasn't been around long enough.
It really hasn't. And so

112
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:06.970
it's, there was there, there
are a couple of podcasts

113
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:09.700
that I really liked that
I would recommend it to

114
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:12.610
anybody interested in data science,
check out my Twitter feed.

115
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:16.120
I usually talk about these,
these things that I'm listening

116
00:07:16.120 --> 00:07:18.910
to, and there's a lot
of gatekeeping that's starting to

117
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:21.880
creep up in data science,
which is annoying to me.

118
00:07:22.180 --> 00:07:25.120
What do you mean by
that gatekeeping? I mean, by

119
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:28.930
that folks who have what
they deemed to be a

120
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:33.760
traditional path, because that's the,
the breadth of experience that

121
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.300
they've had, and they're confusing
that with the normal distribution.

122
00:07:37.930 --> 00:07:40.540
And so they think that
that N of one, or

123
00:07:40.540 --> 00:07:44.500
that N of five is
the one true way. And

124
00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:49.090
so it usually has to
do with, you know, early

125
00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:53.260
access to math education or
computer science or folks who

126
00:07:53.260 --> 00:08:01.210
had parents or, or uncles,
or, or guides very early

127
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:05.410
on who had PhDs and
were not, you know, I,

128
00:08:06.220 --> 00:08:09.490
when I graduated, nobody in
my family has a PhD.

129
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:12.610
And so I, I thought
I really wanted to go

130
00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.330
down that route, but I
had no idea, none whatsoever,

131
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.600
even with the background that
I did have, which was

132
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:25.750
incredibly fortunate, right. I went
to a really good school,

133
00:08:26.410 --> 00:08:29.500
even then I was sort
of thrown to what's the

134
00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:32.740
next step? How does this
work, wait, what are grants

135
00:08:32.740 --> 00:08:34.450
do I pay for this?
This is really expensive. I

136
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:41.410
can't afford this kind of
mentality. And so I think,

137
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.630
yeah, I think it's important
to, to, to highlight that

138
00:08:47.050 --> 00:08:51.340
folks can get into it
anyway. And these gatekeepers really

139
00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:56.790
need to, to think about
how the folks who are

140
00:08:56.790 --> 00:09:00.050
listening to them are receiving
that message. Hm that's interesting.

141
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:04.400
Are you familiar with the,
the, the fallacy of no

142
00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:08.990
true Scotsman? Yes. That's exactly
what this is. Yeah. So

143
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:10.580
for people who are listening,
who may not be familiar

144
00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:13.340
with that, it's this idea
that you, you have some

145
00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:15.620
generalization and the way that
you poke at it or

146
00:09:15.620 --> 00:09:18.620
ruin it is by giving
counter examples. So someone says,

147
00:09:18.650 --> 00:09:20.540
and I can say this,
cause I'm a Scotsman. My

148
00:09:20.540 --> 00:09:24.260
family's from Scotland. Someone says,
no, no Scotsman puts sugar

149
00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.290
on his porridge and makes
a big generalization like that.

150
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.450
And then someone else says,
well, my uncle Angus, he

151
00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:31.760
likes sugar on his porridge.
And then they change the

152
00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.730
definition. Well, well, no true
Scotsman put sugar in his

153
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.910
porch. So the gatekeepers can
do that with the definition

154
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:41.210
of a data. No true
data scientist does this thereby

155
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:44.910
changing the goalposts, as we
say, and moving the, the,

156
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:48.560
the finish line. Right. And
so if you haven't had,

157
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:53.450
you know, if you haven't
mastered calculus, you couldn't possibly

158
00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:58.520
be able to, to appreciate
or perform well in this

159
00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:04.430
field. Oh, well, I meant,
you know, I meant multi-variate

160
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:08.810
calculus. Well, no, I meant
partial derivatives and no, I

161
00:10:08.810 --> 00:10:11.690
meant linear algebra. And it
just, they're all of these

162
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:15.080
terms that they don't mean
a thing. I mean, all

163
00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.050
we're, nobody's storming the beaches
of Normandy, you know, we

164
00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:20.600
are sitting in front of
a computer and we're trying

165
00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:24.320
to get it to do
something we're trying to infer

166
00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:27.820
understanding from data. And so
it's much more important to

167
00:10:27.890 --> 00:10:32.990
have an, an understanding of
what that means from the

168
00:10:32.990 --> 00:10:37.250
fact that data are just
artifacts of processes. And so

169
00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:40.220
it's really important to understand
the process that generated that

170
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:45.320
data, you know, data isn't
truth data is a version

171
00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:49.610
of truth that got captured
in time. And so having

172
00:10:49.610 --> 00:10:52.820
that kind of understanding is
much more important than the

173
00:10:52.820 --> 00:10:57.170
statistics. Notwithstanding the fact that
statistics are really important to

174
00:10:57.440 --> 00:11:00.680
it sort of statistics you
can learn, but you also

175
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:05.270
can learn about systems. It's,
there's not one thing that

176
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:08.600
without which you can't succeed
in the, in the space.

177
00:11:09.290 --> 00:11:11.510
Interesting. So that makes me,
that brings up in my

178
00:11:11.510 --> 00:11:15.080
mind and interesting question, you
know, when we talk about

179
00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:18.380
like moral decisions, someone will
say, well, the end justifies

180
00:11:18.380 --> 00:11:21.380
the means, and you had
talked about how, you know,

181
00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:23.900
getting the result. That's, you
know, success is a pretty

182
00:11:23.900 --> 00:11:25.790
good metric. If you write
a program and the right

183
00:11:25.790 --> 00:11:29.240
answer pops out, the other
end, that's pretty successful, whether

184
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:32.030
you're a non traditional data
scientist or not, you know,

185
00:11:32.030 --> 00:11:33.890
maybe back up a few
years and then your claim

186
00:11:33.890 --> 00:11:35.300
to fame. And one of
the things that you won

187
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.040
an award for was something
of a program that you

188
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:39.740
wrote. Maybe you could tell
us about that. Yeah. So

189
00:11:40.370 --> 00:11:43.220
it was a team effort.
So I can't claim a

190
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.760
lot of the, the, the
credit, but this was several

191
00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.580
years back. It was the
Edelman award for operations research

192
00:11:52.610 --> 00:11:56.230
in. And what we did
is we were working with

193
00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:02.170
a seed company and they,
they were just starting to

194
00:12:02.170 --> 00:12:06.790
use data more intelligently. And
so what they did is

195
00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:09.310
based on the data that
they had gathered on how

196
00:12:09.340 --> 00:12:13.780
soybeans grew all over the
world, you know, North Northern

197
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.950
hemisphere, Southern hemisphere, taking advantage
of, of non interrupted summers,

198
00:12:18.070 --> 00:12:20.920
all sorts of stuff. They
wanted to make sure that

199
00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:26.170
at the end of the
simulation, they would know how

200
00:12:26.170 --> 00:12:29.650
to plant their soybeans so
that they had enough seed

201
00:12:29.920 --> 00:12:33.010
at the end of the
whole process to supply the

202
00:12:33.010 --> 00:12:35.320
market. And so you don't
want to have too much

203
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.650
seed. Cause if people aren't
buying, then you have storage

204
00:12:38.650 --> 00:12:42.100
problems. I mean, there's all
sorts of complications that we

205
00:12:42.100 --> 00:12:44.620
had to account for. And
so I wrote this program,

206
00:12:45.760 --> 00:12:49.090
I that's, I didn't write
this program. I duct taped

207
00:12:49.210 --> 00:12:53.260
this thing. And this is
before stack overflow was a

208
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:58.360
thing that I knew about.
So I cobbled it together

209
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:00.160
and it got the right
answer at the end. And

210
00:13:00.160 --> 00:13:04.300
that was actually the version
that got submitted for evaluation

211
00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:08.230
and to complete the, the
whole calculation, it actually took

212
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:12.670
something close to 24 hours,
which is, this is running

213
00:13:12.670 --> 00:13:21.700
on, on a, a powerful
desktop computer. This is before

214
00:13:21.700 --> 00:13:25.750
cloud or anything. And yeah,
and then they brought in

215
00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:28.630
somebody who knows what they're
doing, not in terms of

216
00:13:28.630 --> 00:13:32.290
understanding the systems and, and
understanding the stats and the

217
00:13:32.290 --> 00:13:34.420
underlying math. You know, a
lot of what I had

218
00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:36.670
to do is I had
to fly to Minnesota and

219
00:13:36.670 --> 00:13:39.970
Iowa and talk to a
lot of farmers and really

220
00:13:39.970 --> 00:13:43.390
understand what it was that
they were doing and extract

221
00:13:43.390 --> 00:13:45.640
that knowledge that was below
their set, their, their level

222
00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:49.660
of awareness. Right. I can't
ask them these specific technical

223
00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:52.390
mathematical questions. They have no
clue. Right. I have to

224
00:13:52.390 --> 00:13:55.510
ask them, when do you
plant and why, and why

225
00:13:55.510 --> 00:13:59.100
do you choose to plant
it this way? And, and

226
00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:01.630
in any case, so that's,
that was what my contribution

227
00:14:01.630 --> 00:14:04.570
was. But then afterwards, they
brought somebody in who knows

228
00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:07.660
programming, who took all of
that work that I had

229
00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:12.670
put together and actually wrote
it correctly. And now he

230
00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:20.010
runs in three minutes. Oh
my God, of course. But

231
00:14:20.550 --> 00:14:22.890
it definitely puts the whole
kind of big O notation

232
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:26.400
concept, right. In a very
visceral way. I mean, yes,

233
00:14:26.400 --> 00:14:29.040
somebody, somebody found your nested
four loop and fixed it,

234
00:14:29.490 --> 00:14:32.670
but at the same time,
though, it did work other

235
00:14:32.670 --> 00:14:35.340
than the fact that it
was slow. Maybe we could

236
00:14:35.340 --> 00:14:36.960
have thrown more hardware at
it and it would have

237
00:14:36.970 --> 00:14:40.170
happened in three minutes. We
certainly could. And again, this

238
00:14:40.170 --> 00:14:46.200
is, this was in 2011,
2012. So this is a

239
00:14:46.200 --> 00:14:52.580
while back. And, and, and
the interesting thing, and this

240
00:14:52.580 --> 00:14:55.490
is something that I believe
very strongly. This is what

241
00:14:55.490 --> 00:14:58.310
I, I spoke about when
I went to CSV comp,

242
00:14:58.760 --> 00:15:03.110
is that there are all
sorts of different dimensions within

243
00:15:03.110 --> 00:15:06.230
which we are excellent, but
there are so many more

244
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:11.060
dimensions that, that we are
not excellent in. And, and

245
00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.440
what you want to do
is you want to have

246
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.310
teams of excellent people who
have each other's backs, who

247
00:15:16.310 --> 00:15:20.690
cover each other's blind spots.
And so you can try

248
00:15:20.690 --> 00:15:24.140
to find that one human
who is really excellent at

249
00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:27.570
all the things that are
important to you, but that

250
00:15:27.710 --> 00:15:32.750
aid, that doesn't scale, be
things of importance aren't permanent.

251
00:15:32.990 --> 00:15:36.980
And those things also fluctuate.
And that's why, you know,

252
00:15:37.010 --> 00:15:41.690
my having this awesome ability
in one sense, you know,

253
00:15:41.690 --> 00:15:47.120
mathematically, but, but not having
it in programming, which isn't

254
00:15:47.120 --> 00:15:50.090
something that I don't think
I couldn't overcome. I just

255
00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:54.170
haven't dedicated the time. That's
what I think when you

256
00:15:54.170 --> 00:15:57.800
put together a team that
covers all of those spots,

257
00:15:58.880 --> 00:16:02.240
you just have such a
much more resilient, both, both

258
00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:07.460
chance that both product, but
also roadmap because your priorities

259
00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:11.570
now can change and you
can adapt without giving up

260
00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:15.550
excellence. So it sounds like
if I can put words

261
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.460
in your mouth, you're probably
against the idea of the

262
00:16:18.560 --> 00:16:22.150
rockstar programmer or the unicorn
that knows everything. The full

263
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:26.890
stack developer, who is an
expert in everything. So I

264
00:16:26.890 --> 00:16:29.470
do believe so. I do
believe they exist. I'm not

265
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:32.950
saying they don't exist. Well,
maybe they're not as strategy

266
00:16:32.950 --> 00:16:35.320
for team building, I guess,
as well. Exactly what it

267
00:16:35.320 --> 00:16:39.730
is. I think there's, there's
this research and Oh, I

268
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:44.050
wish I would remember Amy
Edmondson. I think I may

269
00:16:44.050 --> 00:16:48.280
be misspelling. Her last name
is pronouncing it, but she

270
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:52.510
did some research on this
concept of super chickens. Have

271
00:16:52.510 --> 00:16:55.210
you heard of super chickens?
I have not, but I

272
00:16:55.210 --> 00:16:57.760
know that Amy Edmonson was
a professor of leadership at

273
00:16:57.760 --> 00:17:02.560
Harvard and did a Ted
talk. Yes. And so I

274
00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:05.260
think it's her. It may,
I may be confusing them.

275
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:07.840
So I'll send you the
correct information to put on

276
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.990
show notes. That way people
can't not find the correct

277
00:17:10.990 --> 00:17:14.770
information because my memory is
a faulty, but anyway, super

278
00:17:14.770 --> 00:17:19.630
chickens is this concept. So
the research was they put

279
00:17:19.630 --> 00:17:22.870
some chickens together and they
measured their outcome by how

280
00:17:22.870 --> 00:17:26.080
many eggs they laid. And
so they, they picked the

281
00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.280
best ones by this metric.
And they started selecting the

282
00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:34.030
populations and creating these populations
that were made up only

283
00:17:34.030 --> 00:17:38.380
of the best. And then
they put together this hyper

284
00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:42.370
best population of only super
chickens. And what ended up

285
00:17:42.370 --> 00:17:47.440
happening is that they all
killed each other. So I

286
00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:52.530
believe that there are these
programmers who can elevate the

287
00:17:52.530 --> 00:17:55.290
quality of the rest of
the team, as long as

288
00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.530
they don't have, you know,
detrimental qualities of, you know,

289
00:18:01.830 --> 00:18:06.090
putting down other people, harassing
people, being unethical, things that

290
00:18:06.090 --> 00:18:09.810
you shouldn't compromise, but some
companies do for some reason,

291
00:18:10.590 --> 00:18:14.010
as long as those things,
aren't there. Unicorns short can

292
00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:16.350
elevate the rest of the
team. But the problem is

293
00:18:16.350 --> 00:18:18.990
when you try to create
a team of only unicorns,

294
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:22.230
first of all, it's going
to take you forever to

295
00:18:22.230 --> 00:18:27.720
staff because they're hard to
find and they are, they

296
00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:30.960
know they're there they're worth.
The second thing is going

297
00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:34.590
to be really expensive cause
they know what their value

298
00:18:34.590 --> 00:18:36.240
is. It's part of what
makes them a 10 X

299
00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.010
or a hundred X whatever.
And, but the other thing

300
00:18:41.010 --> 00:18:44.610
is that it tends to
be highly correlated with an

301
00:18:44.610 --> 00:18:48.480
inflated sense of self worth.
So they may think that

302
00:18:48.480 --> 00:18:49.980
they're a 10 X, but
they act like they're a

303
00:18:49.980 --> 00:18:55.200
50 X, which causes all
sorts of imbalances and all

304
00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:57.210
sorts of, you know, the
juice ends up not being

305
00:18:57.210 --> 00:19:03.800
worth the squeeze. Oh, interesting.
You know, it makes me

306
00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:05.600
think about the times when
you watch a movie and

307
00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.090
someone's trying to create a
super soldier and they always

308
00:19:08.090 --> 00:19:11.030
have like the, you know,
kind of the dungeon, Dungeons

309
00:19:11.030 --> 00:19:13.460
and dragons card where it's
like, we need maximum strength

310
00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:16.250
and maximum intelligence, but no
one ever seems to optimize

311
00:19:16.250 --> 00:19:18.770
for niceness and team building.
You know, when you put

312
00:19:18.770 --> 00:19:21.410
them together. Well, the super
soldiers, you know, to make

313
00:19:21.410 --> 00:19:25.370
sure that they're super nice
and get along. Yeah. My

314
00:19:25.370 --> 00:19:29.830
grandmother used to always say
which, you know, with, with

315
00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:32.420
the, the, the type of
folks, the self selection of

316
00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.420
folks who go into tech,
this is highly relevant. She

317
00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:38.210
used to say that God
has two cups, one of

318
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:41.030
common sense and one of,
sort of street smart, and

319
00:19:41.030 --> 00:19:44.630
one of book-smart and only
so much water in the

320
00:19:44.630 --> 00:19:48.260
pitcher. And for every person,
he either fills up the

321
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:51.230
book-smart fills up the street
smart, or there's a balance.

322
00:19:52.850 --> 00:19:55.340
And, and I think that's
very true. There's a self

323
00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:02.000
selection of folks who go
into tech professions, where, where

324
00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:03.680
they have a lot of
book-smart and not a lot

325
00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.940
of street smartware knowing that,
you know, building a strong

326
00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:14.390
coalition is important. Being resilient
to strategy is important and

327
00:20:14.390 --> 00:20:16.700
being kind, I don't know
if being nice, but being

328
00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:20.480
kind, you know, kindness includes
telling somebody that they've stepped

329
00:20:20.480 --> 00:20:24.620
over the line. This includes
telling somebody, Hey, I noticed

330
00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:26.690
that you have this gap
in your knowledge. Here's how

331
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:30.050
you can fix that. And
kindness means being able to

332
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:35.840
welcome that feedback. It would
be nice if kindness were,

333
00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:39.590
were more appreciated in tech.
Sometimes this is something I've

334
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.390
been a proponent of for
many years. And I feel

335
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:45.170
like people believe that being
nice or being kind is

336
00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:48.430
a form of weakness. And
you know, if one word,

337
00:20:48.460 --> 00:20:50.980
if want it to be
excellent, like let's just, let's

338
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:52.870
let Linus be Linus. You
know, he doesn't have to

339
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:55.720
be pleasant. He's, you know,
talk is cheap. Show me

340
00:20:55.720 --> 00:20:58.600
the code. Right. It doesn't
matter if he said it

341
00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.880
with 12 F words and
insulted a whole class of

342
00:21:00.880 --> 00:21:03.940
people while he was doing
the, the source code commit.

343
00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:08.130
That's insane to me because
there are so many intangibles

344
00:21:08.730 --> 00:21:13.500
in that equation, just the,
the code works. Sure. But

345
00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:16.230
how much are you going
to have to pay out

346
00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:22.830
in, in health insurance? Because
everybody needs a therapist or

347
00:21:22.860 --> 00:21:27.330
because everybody's immune system is
compromised because they're so stressed.

348
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.770
You know, these, these are
actual impactful to the bottom

349
00:21:31.770 --> 00:21:36.000
line numbers that just somehow
get brushed under the carpet

350
00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.810
as well. Those don't matter
because of X, Y, and

351
00:21:39.810 --> 00:21:43.110
Z. Right? And, and it,
and that's where the kindness

352
00:21:43.110 --> 00:21:46.860
comes in. Kindness is a
muscle, right? You can exercise

353
00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:52.320
it, you can prioritize it.
And, and it has tangible

354
00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.730
impacts to the bottom line.
Yep. We don't want these

355
00:21:56.730 --> 00:22:00.720
super chickson super chickens killing
everyone. I did find the

356
00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:04.860
information on that. It was
Margaret Heffernan talked about super

357
00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:07.980
chickens in a Ted talk
and the experiment itself was

358
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.870
named by a geneticist named
William William Muir. That's right. So

359
00:22:12.870 --> 00:22:16.170
there's another, there's another something
interesting from, from Amy, which

360
00:22:16.170 --> 00:22:18.510
I think is a Ted
talk that you mentioned, right?

361
00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:21.300
That, that I also bring
up in my talk, those

362
00:22:21.300 --> 00:22:24.060
two studies I think are
really interesting. Right? So between

363
00:22:24.060 --> 00:22:28.560
Amy Edmonson, am I going
to have Heffernan? You've got

364
00:22:28.560 --> 00:22:32.280
a pretty good bunch of
research into egos and equality

365
00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:35.010
and leadership and how those
things fit in. Right. And

366
00:22:35.010 --> 00:22:41.700
how to create sustainable high
performance teams that don't break

367
00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.040
the bank. Right? Like this
is, this is money balling.

368
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:47.760
Yeah. It is. Well, how
do you also not break

369
00:22:47.760 --> 00:22:50.880
your break, your engineers? When,
like, for example, if you

370
00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.710
tell someone to get some
piece of work done or

371
00:22:52.710 --> 00:22:55.800
you assign them some task,
does it matter to you?

372
00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:59.430
If you, for example, discovered
after the fact that that

373
00:22:59.430 --> 00:23:02.100
person worked 16 hours for
three days and was up

374
00:23:02.100 --> 00:23:06.930
all night and missed their
child's birthday, did it all

375
00:23:06.930 --> 00:23:09.690
silently though, without complaint to
get the job done. And

376
00:23:09.690 --> 00:23:11.580
then, you know, months later
you discovered that they've been

377
00:23:11.580 --> 00:23:15.060
killing themselves to get that
work done. I think that's

378
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.540
why there's 7 billion of us
right there, different clocks and

379
00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.480
different folks marched to a
different drummer. So in what,

380
00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.110
what I would do is
I would go to this

381
00:23:25.110 --> 00:23:28.080
person and try to make
it abundantly clear that they

382
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:32.370
understood that that was not
required, neither required nor expected,

383
00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.460
but if there's, you know,
and if they want to

384
00:23:35.790 --> 00:23:39.870
make that up otherwise so
that, you know, now they

385
00:23:39.870 --> 00:23:43.380
can go on a vacation
that isn't an extra couple

386
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:45.710
of days longer and we'll
work it out HR, and

387
00:23:45.710 --> 00:23:48.410
we'll figure something out too,
to offset it or to

388
00:23:48.410 --> 00:23:51.980
ensure that they're not burning
out. I might recommend that

389
00:23:51.980 --> 00:23:54.620
they go, you know, take
a couple of days off,

390
00:23:54.650 --> 00:23:59.690
go, go play a video
game who cares? Right. But

391
00:23:59.690 --> 00:24:02.480
if they don't want that,
and they didn't feel that

392
00:24:02.480 --> 00:24:04.880
that was expected. And that
was just as internal drive

393
00:24:04.880 --> 00:24:07.910
that they have because they
wanted to deliver the best

394
00:24:07.910 --> 00:24:11.660
and they knew they could
do it. That's great. You

395
00:24:11.660 --> 00:24:14.690
know, I'm not gonna tell
anybody I folks have agency.

396
00:24:15.170 --> 00:24:19.400
I'm not going to tell
anybody, you know, I'm not

397
00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:21.710
going to tell you how
to apportion your time. I'm

398
00:24:21.710 --> 00:24:23.510
not going to ask, right?
I'm not going to ask

399
00:24:23.510 --> 00:24:27.080
you to keep the seat
warm. I have absolutely no

400
00:24:27.170 --> 00:24:31.310
desire to see folks from
nine to five, as long

401
00:24:31.310 --> 00:24:34.070
as the things that we
sign up to do get

402
00:24:34.070 --> 00:24:38.300
accomplished. As long as we're
not dropping, dropping any balls

403
00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:41.150
or leaving anyone behind, if
we had the chance to

404
00:24:41.150 --> 00:24:44.270
help another team. And we're
not taking that chance, I

405
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.080
think that's, that's a little,
that's a little lucky otherwise.

406
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:51.700
No, it's hard though. I
was getting into an argument

407
00:24:51.700 --> 00:24:54.400
with someone online recently when
I made, what I thought

408
00:24:54.400 --> 00:24:58.030
was a non noncontroversial statement
about how important work life

409
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.540
balance was. And for us
all, to remember why we

410
00:25:01.540 --> 00:25:04.480
work. And there was a
whole thread on Twitter a

411
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.040
couple of days ago where
people were talking about, well,

412
00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.500
there is no work life
balance. There was some, some

413
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.640
San Francisco VC type personality.
You saw that. And he

414
00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:14.920
was like, there's only work
life integration. And I'm like,

415
00:25:15.250 --> 00:25:17.740
really are we, we go
into the dictionary now and

416
00:25:17.740 --> 00:25:20.650
just picking words, you know,
you can call it whatever

417
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:22.570
you want, but there's only
24 hours in a day.

418
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:27.550
And that feels so prescriptive.
It, it feels so it

419
00:25:27.550 --> 00:25:31.390
feels so presumptive to know
It's a big old declarative

420
00:25:31.390 --> 00:25:35.830
statement, that shelter It's one,
it's the one truce Cottman,

421
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:40.390
right? Which only light, only
work life integration. Nothing else

422
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.970
will know. That's what works
for some folks now for

423
00:25:42.970 --> 00:25:46.000
everyone. And, and who am
I to know what works

424
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.490
best for you, Scott? Or
what, what works best for

425
00:25:48.520 --> 00:25:51.460
anyone? I know what works
best for me. And I

426
00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:55.600
make that work for me.
But if somebody else doesn't

427
00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:58.570
want to have work life
balance, that's, you know, I

428
00:25:58.570 --> 00:26:01.090
will, I will try to,
to figure out if there's

429
00:26:01.090 --> 00:26:04.180
something that is coming from
a place of pain, or

430
00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:07.000
if it's coming from a
place of ignorance or if

431
00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:10.480
it's coming from a place
of insecurity. But as long

432
00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.180
as none of those things,
to the best of my

433
00:26:13.180 --> 00:26:17.800
ability are there, folks can
do what they want. They

434
00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:20.560
can have balance where they
work only nine to five

435
00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.200
and they shut their phone
off. Or they can come

436
00:26:23.200 --> 00:26:26.470
in at 10 30 and
leave at three 30. And

437
00:26:26.470 --> 00:26:29.020
then, you know, for three
months straight, they leave at

438
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:34.030
midnight because that's how their,
their brain works. As long

439
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:38.560
as nobody is burning out.
Which again, it's not purely

440
00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:41.950
altruistic, right? Like this is
going to have a negative

441
00:26:41.950 --> 00:26:46.830
impact. That's going to ripple
through my teams. So, so,

442
00:26:46.860 --> 00:26:52.590
you know, if I do
think that requiring everyone to

443
00:26:52.590 --> 00:26:57.480
act a certain way, takes
away their autonomy and nothing

444
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.920
good comes from that. Yeah,
it's definitely, that is one

445
00:27:00.920 --> 00:27:03.440
of the blessings of being
in the tech industry is

446
00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:06.350
for most people, unless you're
at a nine to five

447
00:27:06.410 --> 00:27:08.240
kind of cube farm, which
I know some of my

448
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.760
listeners are, and I spent
many years doing that for

449
00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:12.500
the most part, we do
have a certain amount of

450
00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:15.800
autonomy in the sense of
there's core hours. There's get

451
00:27:15.800 --> 00:27:18.020
your job done and you
can work from home or

452
00:27:18.020 --> 00:27:21.560
take a Friday off and
things like that. And that's

453
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:23.450
why we'd like to see
more people get into the

454
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:26.390
tech industry. They can be
productive and possibly have some

455
00:27:26.390 --> 00:27:29.000
amount of work life balance.
Right. And it's all about

456
00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:33.080
shared expectations. I think if
everybody has signed on to

457
00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:37.040
the plan, that's great. But
if one person sort of

458
00:27:38.270 --> 00:27:42.020
doesn't have that doesn't deliver
on the expectations of the

459
00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:45.740
team, then something's broken, right?
Like it's all about that

460
00:27:45.740 --> 00:27:48.410
balance. And it's all about
being kind to your teammates

461
00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:51.950
and making sure that you're
meeting their expectations so that

462
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.690
when you expect things from
them, that's returned. What are

463
00:27:56.690 --> 00:27:58.850
a couple of tips that
you can maybe offer as

464
00:27:58.850 --> 00:28:00.620
we get towards the end
of the show here about

465
00:28:00.620 --> 00:28:02.840
helping others to break into
not only the tech industry,

466
00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:05.000
but also maybe get interested
in data science if they,

467
00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:07.070
they know how to say
the words, but they maybe

468
00:28:07.070 --> 00:28:09.830
don't know what the right
direction, if they want to

469
00:28:09.830 --> 00:28:12.740
go into that direction of
technology. Yeah. So you can

470
00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:15.560
always find me on Twitter.
I'm happy to answer questions.

471
00:28:15.650 --> 00:28:20.780
I'm, I'm also happy to,
to broadcast any work that

472
00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:23.840
anybody has done. So if
you have a blog post

473
00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:27.260
of some analysis that, that
you've done and you want

474
00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:29.870
to reach a bigger audience,
let me know, and I'll

475
00:28:29.870 --> 00:28:33.290
signal boost. And if you're
interested in just learning a

476
00:28:33.290 --> 00:28:36.770
little bit more, there are
some really great resources. But

477
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:40.940
one of my favorites is
the becoming a data scientist

478
00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:46.190
podcast, which has interviews with
lots of folks, none of

479
00:28:46.190 --> 00:28:50.780
whom really have a traditional
background. So it's really interesting

480
00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.950
to see the different paths
that folks took into, into

481
00:28:54.950 --> 00:28:59.750
the field. I also really
like partially derivative the podcast

482
00:29:00.050 --> 00:29:05.090
and both of those podcasts
also have very robust websites

483
00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:09.770
backing them with, with lots
of tools and trainings and

484
00:29:10.010 --> 00:29:15.650
links to, to the big
world of, of data science.

485
00:29:16.910 --> 00:29:19.520
And even though when we
go to these places and

486
00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.730
see that people have PhDs
or advanced degrees from advanced

487
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:27.020
places, should we still persist?
Oh my gosh. Yeah. So

488
00:29:27.950 --> 00:29:32.600
first off I don't have
a PhD and I, and

489
00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:38.030
I did actual real data
science work and got compensated

490
00:29:38.030 --> 00:29:43.780
for it. So I was
a professional, the right. And,

491
00:29:43.990 --> 00:29:47.020
and the other thing is
my team of all the

492
00:29:47.020 --> 00:29:50.050
folks that, that are in
my team right now, it's

493
00:29:50.050 --> 00:29:54.460
about a 50 50 of
PhDs, non PhDs, which I

494
00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:57.010
think is also important because
it sort of brings this,

495
00:29:57.040 --> 00:30:00.310
this really interesting mix of
folks who, who don't have

496
00:30:00.310 --> 00:30:03.070
baked in assumptions. And it
forces us to think through

497
00:30:03.070 --> 00:30:08.410
things rather than just the
fault to the training and

498
00:30:08.410 --> 00:30:11.650
yeah, absolutely. You don't need
a PhD to become a

499
00:30:11.650 --> 00:30:15.060
data scientist or to be
successful in it. Right. And

500
00:30:15.060 --> 00:30:16.950
just like, you don't need
to be a singer to

501
00:30:16.950 --> 00:30:23.400
do karaoke. Exactly. That's very
cool. Well, thank you so

502
00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:26.340
much for chatting with me
today. Thank you, Scott. This

503
00:30:26.340 --> 00:30:29.580
has been really, really great.
I appreciate the opportunity to

504
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:32.610
geek out and, and share
a little bit of, of

505
00:30:32.610 --> 00:30:36.330
the empiricism love. Absolutely. My
pleasure. And this was Angela

506
00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.110
Bassa. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

507
00:30:40.110 --> 00:30:48.960
see you again next week.
