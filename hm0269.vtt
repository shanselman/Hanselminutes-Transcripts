Scott talks with Brandon Watson, senior

7
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:51.660
director of the windows phone
developer experience. Hi, this is

8
00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:54.750
Scott Hanselman. This is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

9
00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:58.650
today I'm talking about some
community things as a community

10
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:01.320
person, myself and by community
person. I mean, I work

11
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:03.690
with the community as a
part of my regular job.

12
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.960
I thought I'd talked to
Brandon Watson, Brandon. What's your, what's

13
00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:11.270
your official title? Official title
is senior director windows phone

14
00:01:11.270 --> 00:01:15.500
developer experience. Yeah, that's a
long, complicated title. Yeah. Yeah.

15
00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:19.340
I'm just, I I've taken
a new email address. I

16
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.580
am now simply the phone
at Microsoft. That is it's

17
00:01:22.580 --> 00:01:26.510
simple. I work on the
phone. Yep. Is that hard

18
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.280
to do? Did you just
change it and didn't tell

19
00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:31.490
anybody, or how did you,
I created a, I created

20
00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:34.370
a distribution group that has
one member me. And so

21
00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.020
if you send an email
to the phone at Microsoft,

22
00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:41.720
it goes to me. Sorry.
I think that's funny. Cause

23
00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:43.760
you're always here always breaking
the rules, but didn't expect

24
00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:47.780
you to lead with a
broken rule. That's awesome. Well,

25
00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:51.110
you know, it's, it simplifies
the title soup that we

26
00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.290
get into here at Microsoft.
That's cool. I'm going to

27
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.000
have to go and do
something like a, you know,

28
00:01:56.900 --> 00:02:00.920
the dude at Microsoft, it's
easier for me just going

29
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:03.140
and creating them distribution list
with one person. And this

30
00:02:03.140 --> 00:02:05.750
opens up a whole new
world for me to potentially

31
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.220
make inappropriate and abusive internal
aliases at Microsoft. That will

32
00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.510
help me better. Okay. So
I'm yeah. I like to

33
00:02:14.510 --> 00:02:18.980
make up titles for myself.
I had a developer liaison,

34
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.570
which I thought was a
pretty cool one for awhile.

35
00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.020
It's a little, a little,
a little officious, but okay.

36
00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:30.020
Yeah. Well liaison was a
little bit, It was a

37
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:32.600
friend Jackson. It makes it
much more official. Oh. And

38
00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:37.940
also offensive. She's nice. And
then I had, well now

39
00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:42.410
it's community architect, which I
think is cool. I was

40
00:02:42.410 --> 00:02:44.390
thinking about, I thought someone
said I should be an

41
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:49.490
ombudsman. You think liaison is
snooty. Ombudsman is definitely ridiculous.

42
00:02:49.940 --> 00:02:52.670
A button carries with it,
a certain connotation side of

43
00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:57.800
the university, right? Scholastic pursuits,
whereas liaison, you know, perhaps

44
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.480
attache, you could be the
community, right. That sounds much

45
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:05.620
more political or bureaucratic in
nature. And so these, these,

46
00:03:05.680 --> 00:03:07.900
these titles, they tend to
get a bit weird. You

47
00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:09.640
know, it'd be nice to
go back to the.com days

48
00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.860
where we all had crazy
titles. Like, you know, I'm

49
00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.410
the, I'm the chief cat
herder, right? I mean, that's

50
00:03:14.410 --> 00:03:21.870
a, that's what I go
for. <inaudible>, you've opened up

51
00:03:21.870 --> 00:03:24.780
an entire European hotel thing
for me now where I

52
00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:31.050
could potentially be the community
concierge. There you go. Okay.

53
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:33.570
I'm the bellhop. Are there
other people? I mean, do

54
00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:36.060
I assume people just figure
that you're in evangelist? Right.

55
00:03:36.070 --> 00:03:38.610
I always get called evangelists.
It's not, I don't work

56
00:03:38.610 --> 00:03:41.760
for the evangelism group, but
inevitably someone thinks I do.

57
00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.270
Yeah. It's funny. That's when
I get quoted in press,

58
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:47.580
I get called when this
phone of Angeles, even my

59
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:51.680
boss doesn't really understand the
entirety of my job. And

60
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.000
so we've had some good
heart to heart discussions about

61
00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.960
that. You know, officially I'm
responsible for product management of

62
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:00.540
the application platform on the
phone, you know, all of

63
00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:03.600
our analysts and press relations,
all of our messaging, you

64
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.000
know, managing the community as
part of that, or, you

65
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.180
know, all of our, to
developer marketing and programs and

66
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:11.490
working with partners. And there's,
there's a broad scope of

67
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:14.080
things, but ultimately it's the
public facing stuff, which, which

68
00:04:14.130 --> 00:04:17.070
gets a lot of the
attention. And, and that just

69
00:04:17.070 --> 00:04:20.070
ends up getting rolled into
the evangelism bucket. So oftentimes

70
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.780
I get called wins one
of Angeles, but there's an

71
00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.360
entire division of folks that
are called evangelists and I

72
00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.430
would be doing shame to
their name and what they

73
00:04:26.430 --> 00:04:28.740
do by, by saying that
I'm a evangelists. I mean,

74
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:30.990
I do good work, that's
fine. But they, their skillset

75
00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:33.960
vastly exceeds mine in terms
of what they do and

76
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.710
what they're required to do
for their jobs. So evangelists

77
00:04:38.130 --> 00:04:42.000
at Microsoft make, you know,
things like webcams, like James

78
00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.840
sr created the whole web
camps concept that's executed on

79
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:47.730
it. So like his job
was you conceive of that

80
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:49.730
to execute on and to
deliver those. And I helped

81
00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:52.200
deliver those with him. That
was definitely something I don't

82
00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.300
think I could've, I could've
done or pulled off on

83
00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:58.620
my own and they make,
you know, code kits and

84
00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:01.080
open source stuff. A lot
of that seems to be

85
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.940
a new thing that a
lot of the evangelists make

86
00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.130
a lot of right now,
everyone seems to have some

87
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:08.370
kind of a code that
they are in charge of.

88
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.120
There's certainly that on the
website. I mean, if you

89
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:15.030
think about historically what the
evangelists were doing, they also

90
00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:16.890
engage with our customers in
the field. A lot of

91
00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.330
corporate and enterprise type evangelism
work is going into a

92
00:05:21.330 --> 00:05:24.180
very large company and saying,
okay, let's talk about what

93
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.770
you're trying to do here.
And let's talk about the

94
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:27.750
entirety of the Microsoft stack
and let's figure out where

95
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:30.600
we can help you solve
these problems. So it's kind

96
00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:33.630
of like technical sales, but
it's really presales. And it's,

97
00:05:33.930 --> 00:05:37.800
it's more just building relationships
with, with your constituents, call

98
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.480
them over time and helping
them solve their problems, using

99
00:05:42.510 --> 00:05:45.540
what we have to offer,
right. And making yourself available.

100
00:05:45.570 --> 00:05:49.350
And I think over time,
the, the, the strategy has

101
00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:55.320
shifted within DP development platform,
evangelism, RTP group. But one

102
00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.910
of the things that we
wanted to do with windows

103
00:05:56.930 --> 00:05:59.330
phone was get back to
having that deep level of

104
00:05:59.330 --> 00:06:02.360
engagement with DPE, where we
have at the product group

105
00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.280
level folks focused on the
community and setting the strategy,

106
00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:09.740
but then working closely with
the field, the guys in

107
00:06:09.740 --> 00:06:12.350
the field, that's out in
the local regions to execute

108
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:16.940
that strategy. And it's been
extremely effective. Cause we basically

109
00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:20.360
started from scratch from zero
a little over a year

110
00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:23.780
ago with his phone community.
And it's, it's grown quite

111
00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.230
nicely and things are, you
know, things are moving in

112
00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:29.510
the right direction and doing
so ahead of pace where

113
00:06:29.510 --> 00:06:32.810
we thought we'd be, which
is great. But you know,

114
00:06:32.930 --> 00:06:35.480
there's definitely an, a large
group of folks that sit

115
00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:37.490
in a different division that,
that helped make that happen.

116
00:06:39.730 --> 00:06:44.470
Do you, do you as
a community guy for the

117
00:06:44.470 --> 00:06:49.090
phone, but I mean, you're
kinda like the primary face

118
00:06:49.090 --> 00:06:51.880
of the phone from the
developer perspective, do you think

119
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.940
of your job as, as
sales or as advocacy? Because

120
00:06:55.060 --> 00:06:56.290
one of the, I can't
get this, let me give

121
00:06:56.290 --> 00:06:59.350
you an example. I gave
this talk a couple of

122
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:03.160
days ago, actually at the
Oregon community computer consultants association,

123
00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:06.910
and they are known to
be a notoriously suspicious bunch.

124
00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:13.430
I just don't like, yeah,
yeah, it's true. And they

125
00:07:13.450 --> 00:07:17.710
don't particularly like Microsoft and
they don't think these are

126
00:07:17.710 --> 00:07:20.770
the guys that are still
mad about FoxPro. He literally,

127
00:07:20.890 --> 00:07:24.910
they are. And I always
have a guy come up

128
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:27.670
to me after the show,
after the show, after my

129
00:07:27.670 --> 00:07:31.480
talk and who says, you
know, Fox pros, the greatest

130
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:34.690
you killed it, kill my
business. You know, it's like,

131
00:07:34.840 --> 00:07:41.920
I wasn't alive. I'm sorry.
I apologize. And so I

132
00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.590
started the talk by just
saying, hi, I'm Scott Hanselman.

133
00:07:44.590 --> 00:07:46.270
I work for Microsoft. I'm
not here to sell you

134
00:07:46.270 --> 00:07:50.860
anything. If you, if you
use windows, then you're already

135
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:53.980
using the thing I had
to sell. And these are

136
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:57.190
windows folks for the most
part. So that, that kind

137
00:07:57.190 --> 00:07:58.660
of disarm them. And then
I just showed them a

138
00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:01.120
whole bunch of free stuff.
And I said, you know,

139
00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:02.740
I don't, I'm not a
business person. I'm not a

140
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:05.620
salesperson. I know that we
have other things we could

141
00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.330
potentially sell you. But ultimately
I don't really care. I

142
00:08:10.330 --> 00:08:11.950
have a lot of free
stuff. If you have windows,

143
00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:13.900
here's some free stuff. And
I talked about SQL server

144
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:17.050
express and secret server, compact
and visual studio and web

145
00:08:17.050 --> 00:08:19.030
matrix and asp.net on and
on and on and on

146
00:08:19.030 --> 00:08:22.450
and on. And by the
end I turned around, you

147
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:25.270
know, quite a few of
them. And then they complained

148
00:08:25.270 --> 00:08:30.370
about windows, but still it
were pretty well. And they,

149
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:32.710
they appreciated that. I wasn't
there to sell them. You

150
00:08:32.710 --> 00:08:36.480
know, I dunno if SharePoint
licenses or whatever. And I

151
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.820
wonder since you just want
people to use the phone

152
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:43.420
cause you presumably like the
phone and there's no, there's

153
00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:45.280
really no additional cost, I
guess how much does it

154
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:49.030
cost to become a developer
Tools for free, of course,

155
00:08:49.030 --> 00:08:51.910
but if you want to
register an unlock your phone,

156
00:08:52.630 --> 00:08:55.350
at least today it's $99.
And that also gets you

157
00:08:55.350 --> 00:08:58.770
five or excuse me, a
hundred free apps, missions, and

158
00:09:00.330 --> 00:09:03.980
valued member of the community,
blah, blah, blah. But it's,

159
00:09:03.980 --> 00:09:05.490
it's free to get the
tools for you to get

160
00:09:05.490 --> 00:09:07.040
stuff. Okay. So you can,
you can start, you can

161
00:09:07.040 --> 00:09:09.410
write a whole app for
free and then when it

162
00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:11.480
comes time to submit it,
then that's 99 bucks and

163
00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.070
then, and then you consume
it up to a hundred

164
00:09:13.070 --> 00:09:15.650
after that. That's right. Well,
I'll do a hundred free

165
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:21.110
unlimited paid, carry a price
tag. Oh yeah, no, go

166
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.770
ahead. Is it a hundred
bucks a year? Yes. A

167
00:09:24.770 --> 00:09:27.950
hundred bucks a year. That's
not bad. No. And that's,

168
00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:31.580
that's what it is today.
You know, it's, it's, I

169
00:09:31.580 --> 00:09:34.670
don't, I don't view my
job as sales. I view

170
00:09:34.670 --> 00:09:38.050
my job, my number one,
you know, there's for, for

171
00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.160
our fiscal year, which actually
ends in about 30 days.

172
00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.320
But for when I took
over this team and, and

173
00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:43.730
we sat down as a
group and we said, okay,

174
00:09:43.730 --> 00:09:47.240
let's, let's set our team
principles in stone. Let's these

175
00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:49.250
are, these are the, these
are, these are the non

176
00:09:49.250 --> 00:09:52.580
negotiables number one was inspired
developers, right? So it's not

177
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:55.010
so much sales as it
is making sure that we

178
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.800
have a clear message around
what windows phone is, what

179
00:09:57.800 --> 00:10:03.500
the opportunity is to developer
and, and improve the effectiveness

180
00:10:03.530 --> 00:10:05.960
of all of our outbound
communications around phone and the

181
00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.700
developer opportunity and, and the
reach and the scope of

182
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:13.160
what we're doing. But that
was the number one principle

183
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:16.100
was inspired developers. And so
every time I take a

184
00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:18.860
stage, right, or I meet
with anybody, I want to

185
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:21.860
understand what they're trying to
do and see if we

186
00:10:21.860 --> 00:10:25.100
can help them do it
faster, better, make more money,

187
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:29.180
get more attention for what
they're doing, because it's, it's

188
00:10:29.180 --> 00:10:31.970
ultimately the number three principles
is make developers rich and

189
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.810
famous, right? So my job
is to make other people

190
00:10:35.810 --> 00:10:39.680
more successful. And if that
happens, then sales, the phone

191
00:10:39.680 --> 00:10:41.780
will happen. If that happens,
apps will show up in

192
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:44.900
marketplace. If that happens, the
whole ecosystem will grow and

193
00:10:44.900 --> 00:10:47.510
everybody wins. So I'm not
trying to sell anybody anything.

194
00:10:47.510 --> 00:10:49.070
I'm trying to understand what
they would like to do

195
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:51.590
and see if we can
help them do that faster.

196
00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:53.510
And there will be cases
where we can't, you know,

197
00:10:53.510 --> 00:10:55.700
there's functionality that wasn't in
the original version of the

198
00:10:55.700 --> 00:10:59.210
phone, like TCP IP sockets,
for example, let's, you know,

199
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:01.920
there's a certain class of
apps. You cannot do a

200
00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:05.450
raw camera access to the
camera brush. There's certain things

201
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:08.300
you cannot do without that.
And so certain developers would

202
00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:10.460
simply just say, yeah, I'm
sorry, we can't help you

203
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.110
right now. And then we
can't actually bring onto the

204
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:13.580
platform and I'm not going
to try and convince you

205
00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:16.500
to build some stunted version
of your app or, or

206
00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:19.070
take down your vision. Right.
And knock it down so

207
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:20.960
that it'll fit on the
phone. Cause that's just, that's

208
00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.210
not good for anybody. I'd
rather tell them, yeah, that's,

209
00:11:23.240 --> 00:11:25.040
that's high on our priority
list. We're working on it

210
00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:27.410
and, you know, get, get
educated and, and stick with

211
00:11:27.410 --> 00:11:29.240
us and learn and, you
know, become a member of

212
00:11:29.240 --> 00:11:31.760
the community. And then hopefully
we can, we can, we

213
00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.060
can get you what you
need over time, but you

214
00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:36.860
know, upfront it's, I'm not
trying to sell anybody, anything.

215
00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.630
I'm the only that I'm
selling as dreams of, you

216
00:11:38.630 --> 00:11:40.670
know, having that moment where
you turn to your buddy

217
00:11:40.670 --> 00:11:42.200
and say, Hey, look at
this out by publishing in

218
00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:47.210
the marketplace. Did, how long
have you worked here now?

219
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:50.960
You know, my story is
a, an odd wandering one.

220
00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:52.760
I actually started as an
intern in the summer of

221
00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.290
90. If you can believe
that and did two summers

222
00:11:56.290 --> 00:11:58.270
here then came back after
business school. And so I

223
00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:02.140
was here for my first
didn't until 99. And I

224
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.680
left in the middle of
the.com kind of craziness when

225
00:12:05.680 --> 00:12:07.510
everybody's shook a tree and
a VC fell out with

226
00:12:07.510 --> 00:12:10.390
a bag of money and
everybody got rich. That was

227
00:12:10.390 --> 00:12:14.320
the script. Anyway, I was
in the, the Lindsay Lohan

228
00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:16.390
version of that movie, that
of a train wreck. And

229
00:12:16.570 --> 00:12:18.610
it didn't, it didn't go
that way. The startup I

230
00:12:18.610 --> 00:12:21.940
went to and from there,
I went to wall street,

231
00:12:22.630 --> 00:12:25.090
did that for a few
years and then did went

232
00:12:25.090 --> 00:12:27.040
back to being an operator.
So I've been in tech

233
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.230
companies for, you know, more
or less 20 years, but

234
00:12:29.230 --> 00:12:32.290
came back to Microsoft in
2008. So I was out

235
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:35.070
of here for nine years.
Yeah. Because I always, I

236
00:12:35.070 --> 00:12:40.320
always tease people at Microsoft
for being, I call them

237
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:46.470
college hires. They've never worked
anywhere else. So, so when

238
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:50.460
you started talking about that
was like 94, I was

239
00:12:50.460 --> 00:12:53.730
thinking to myself, okay, there's
no way that Brandon has

240
00:12:53.730 --> 00:12:57.570
any concept about reality because
I've only worked at one

241
00:12:57.570 --> 00:12:59.910
place, but you said you
started as an intern and

242
00:12:59.910 --> 00:13:03.180
then you left, worked in
the real world and then

243
00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:06.000
came back. And that's kind
of cool because that, that,

244
00:13:06.020 --> 00:13:11.880
that coincidentally, without me, actually,
without me realizing it, the

245
00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.950
people that I ended up
talking to at Microsoft, the

246
00:13:13.950 --> 00:13:16.290
people I work with the
most and the ones that

247
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.560
I enjoy talking to are
either people who've only been

248
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.440
there like three, four years
like myself, you know, like

249
00:13:22.470 --> 00:13:25.860
Phil hack and Damien and
all those folks, or it's

250
00:13:25.860 --> 00:13:31.500
people who work there early
left, went out, failed at

251
00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:36.120
something and then came back
in to fix the something.

252
00:13:38.130 --> 00:13:41.670
And I think that's Perspective,
certainly. I mean, look, you

253
00:13:41.670 --> 00:13:43.260
know, you go work on
wall street, that's one service

254
00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:45.780
writers. I went to a,
a hardware startup, the guys

255
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.730
that invented the blade server
and went through that whole

256
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:50.910
cycle and sold that company.
I started my own software

257
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:53.040
company and did that for
two years and built it

258
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.940
up to about 150,000 customers
and sold that business. And,

259
00:13:57.010 --> 00:13:59.490
you know, it's, it's a
been a variety of experiences.

260
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:01.080
And I, and I joke
that I came back to

261
00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:05.990
Microsoft for what I call
a wife style reasons. My

262
00:14:06.230 --> 00:14:08.550
wife was a bit tired
of the startup life and

263
00:14:08.550 --> 00:14:10.260
needed me to take a
break. And so when we

264
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:12.750
sold the last business and
made enough money to retire

265
00:14:12.750 --> 00:14:15.870
for about two months, which
is what we did, we

266
00:14:15.870 --> 00:14:18.120
made a decision to leave
Texas and she wanted to

267
00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.850
move back to Seattle. And
so coming back to Microsoft

268
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:22.800
was the logical choice, just
from a, you know, it

269
00:14:22.800 --> 00:14:26.040
was an easy re-entry, but
I'd always joked that I

270
00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.870
was an entrepreneur on loan
to Microsoft. And I had

271
00:14:27.870 --> 00:14:32.040
only planned on staying two
years. And when this opportunity

272
00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:34.020
actually presented itself, it was
the reason I stayed. I

273
00:14:34.020 --> 00:14:37.500
mean, it was just such
a huge, ridiculous, all inspiring

274
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.530
opportunity to come and get
to do this job. You

275
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:43.980
know, how could I not
take it? That's funny that

276
00:14:44.010 --> 00:14:46.730
that two years thing, I
don't, I've told a couple

277
00:14:46.750 --> 00:14:49.410
people this, but I kind
of only expected myself to

278
00:14:49.410 --> 00:14:52.160
last two years, you know?
And then two years became

279
00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.900
three and I'm, you know,
I, and I felt like

280
00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.960
I'm getting some things done.
And then in other instances

281
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.290
I'm not getting stuff done.
So yeah, I've always said

282
00:15:00.290 --> 00:15:02.720
that I would stay a
couple of years and try

283
00:15:02.720 --> 00:15:04.340
it out. And then I,
you know, I've had some

284
00:15:04.340 --> 00:15:09.440
accomplishments that I've moved from
different groups and then said,

285
00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:12.650
well, I'll when they fire
me for, for pushing too

286
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:16.550
hard, then that'll be a
good time to leave. And,

287
00:15:16.610 --> 00:15:18.290
you know, Chris, I always
talk about what Chris cell's

288
00:15:18.290 --> 00:15:19.760
told me. He says, if
you don't get slapped by

289
00:15:19.760 --> 00:15:22.790
your boss at least twice
a year, you're not really

290
00:15:22.790 --> 00:15:26.420
doing your job. And that's
kind of helping me. I'm

291
00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.420
always thinking even this week,
I've been thinking of ways

292
00:15:29.420 --> 00:15:31.520
that I could potentially get
in trouble. And everyone's like,

293
00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.440
don't watch out, don't do
that. You'll get an email

294
00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:36.110
from somebody high up, but
that would be good because

295
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:37.790
that would be a slap
from my boss. And I

296
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.740
need at least two of
those a year. You know,

297
00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.960
I listened to that, that
interview you did with Chris.

298
00:15:43.960 --> 00:15:45.250
And it was interesting. So
you said the same thing,

299
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:46.540
like he only planned to
come for a couple of

300
00:15:46.540 --> 00:15:48.370
years and then here he
finds himself it's, you know,

301
00:15:48.370 --> 00:15:51.430
many years later. And then
there was also a, was

302
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:53.080
it the, a, this developer's
life would, by the way,

303
00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.790
even Robert doing a great
job with that, that's a

304
00:15:54.790 --> 00:15:58.780
fantastic separate podcast, but where
you guys, it was some

305
00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.010
set interviews. I listened to
it and I guess it

306
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.300
was December. I don't remember
which one it was, but

307
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:04.090
it was basically people talking
about, you know, you just

308
00:16:04.090 --> 00:16:05.620
kinda, you think you're going
to be there for a

309
00:16:05.620 --> 00:16:08.590
short period of time, and
then you're there for a

310
00:16:08.590 --> 00:16:11.740
long time That happens. I
want to make sure it's

311
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:17.050
clear because first there's the
showing up at somewhere, turning

312
00:16:17.050 --> 00:16:21.550
your brain off and staying
there for 10 years. And

313
00:16:21.550 --> 00:16:23.050
I want to just make
it really clear that no

314
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:26.830
one understands. Absolutely. I'm not
having like, you know, I'm

315
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:28.690
not just showing up and
hanging out and cashing the

316
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:31.750
check. I think you and
I would both say that

317
00:16:32.590 --> 00:16:34.210
we would, I don't know.
I know you well enough

318
00:16:34.210 --> 00:16:36.220
that you would quit if
you had to go and

319
00:16:36.430 --> 00:16:39.400
lie or sell your soul
or anything bad like that.

320
00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.490
I mean, no job is
worth your freaking ethics, of

321
00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:46.870
course, but I'm always looking
for something that I can

322
00:16:47.110 --> 00:16:50.650
either break and then put
back together or fix. And

323
00:16:50.650 --> 00:16:53.980
that's kinda why I'm doing
open source over in, in

324
00:16:53.980 --> 00:16:57.190
web platform and tools. And
if it got uncomfortable, if

325
00:16:57.190 --> 00:16:58.930
it got bad, well, then
I would quit. And I've

326
00:16:58.930 --> 00:17:01.510
already got support from the
life. She's told me ahead

327
00:17:01.510 --> 00:17:03.700
of time that if something
bad happens and I need

328
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:05.800
to like quit on the
spot, she told me if

329
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.420
I, if I have to
quit in order to get

330
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.610
that really awesome quitting thing,
like we have to slam

331
00:17:09.610 --> 00:17:13.000
my fist on the desk
and then like, Get your

332
00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.910
Jerry Maguire. All right. So
I actually have, I have

333
00:17:15.910 --> 00:17:19.000
the, the permission to go
for the pig firing, you

334
00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:21.910
know what I mean? You,
you fired no, I quit.

335
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:25.090
And bam, you know, I'm
fired, you're fired. This whole

336
00:17:25.090 --> 00:17:29.620
damn place is fired the
atrium or whatever, building and

337
00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:33.250
start screaming. Yeah. You know,
it's a funny thing about

338
00:17:33.250 --> 00:17:34.930
this place, right. You know,
I remember when I, when

339
00:17:34.930 --> 00:17:36.790
I got recruited in this
job, the guy that, that

340
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:38.140
actually did the recruiting as
a guy by the name

341
00:17:38.140 --> 00:17:40.540
of Charlie Kendall, who some
people recognize from the community,

342
00:17:40.540 --> 00:17:43.300
but he basically told me
your job is to, he

343
00:17:43.300 --> 00:17:45.100
was speaking tongue in cheek
because he said, your job

344
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:48.220
is to, is to create
the tee shirt. That's going

345
00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:50.820
to get you fired. Right.
Cause if you're not, if

346
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:52.680
you're not living on the
edge, then you're the RA.

347
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:54.120
You're not the guy I
thought we hired for the

348
00:17:54.120 --> 00:17:56.670
job because we have to
do something so ridiculous and

349
00:17:56.670 --> 00:17:59.430
so audacious with, with windows
phone and, and, and what

350
00:17:59.430 --> 00:18:02.070
we have to do to,
to catch and pass our

351
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.780
competition. We're going to have
to live on the edge.

352
00:18:03.780 --> 00:18:07.110
And, and there's a lot
of truth to that. And

353
00:18:07.110 --> 00:18:09.270
so I also have been
given the approval at this

354
00:18:09.270 --> 00:18:11.100
point to, to go out
in a blaze of glory

355
00:18:11.370 --> 00:18:15.120
of double-barreled if I need
to. But so far it

356
00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:20.400
has it's it's, you know,
the guy that is most

357
00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:22.170
dangerous is the guy who's
not afraid to die, right?

358
00:18:22.170 --> 00:18:23.970
So it's, it's, it's good
to have a job where

359
00:18:23.970 --> 00:18:26.340
you can feel really passionate
about what you're doing, but

360
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:29.130
also know that your passion
will live on and it's

361
00:18:29.130 --> 00:18:32.130
not, it's not rooted in
just that thing. Right? You

362
00:18:32.130 --> 00:18:34.230
can take a principled stand
if you need to, but

363
00:18:34.230 --> 00:18:35.730
you have to understand that
if you take that principle

364
00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.580
stand, there will be consequences,
right? You can't, if you

365
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:40.260
want to be proactive and
you want to be principled,

366
00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.240
you also have to understand
that there may be consequences.

367
00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:43.980
And as long as you're
okay with that and come

368
00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.650
to peace with that, it
things get a lot more

369
00:18:46.650 --> 00:18:53.900
clear that that clarity, that
clarity is free. Recent developments

370
00:18:53.900 --> 00:18:56.150
in the.net world have opened
up a niche for a

371
00:18:56.150 --> 00:19:00.230
free.net decompiling tool. And if
you like so many other

372
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:04.190
developers have been looking for
an alternative dotnet decompiler, you're

373
00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:07.520
certainly welcome to watch the
launch of just decompile. It's

374
00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:10.190
a new, powerful tools going
to be free forever. It's

375
00:19:10.190 --> 00:19:14.600
currently available in beta, just
decompile offers a dotnet decompiling

376
00:19:14.630 --> 00:19:18.860
and assembly browsing code analysis,
navigation side by side assembly,

377
00:19:18.860 --> 00:19:23.090
loading, automatically updates, and even
better decompiling accuracy than you're

378
00:19:23.090 --> 00:19:27.200
used to it's by leading.net
vendor. Tellerik our sponsors. And

379
00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:29.510
it's got a very aggressive
release schedule and a roadmap.

380
00:19:29.780 --> 00:19:32.870
All based on community feedback,
you can visit the justi

381
00:19:32.870 --> 00:19:36.380
compile feature suggestion forum, let
Tellerik know what features you'd

382
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:39.110
like to see added or
vote on one suggested by

383
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.290
your peers. The launch will
be in the summer and

384
00:19:42.290 --> 00:19:49.700
you can check them out@tellerik.com
slash.net. Decompiling you know, you

385
00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:53.600
can, you can take that
principle stand one time. That's

386
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:56.600
right. You can take it
exactly one time. Hello. That's

387
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.580
I suppose, unless you get,
you could get demoted, but

388
00:19:58.580 --> 00:20:00.230
I don't know how many,
how many lives you actually

389
00:20:00.230 --> 00:20:05.330
get. I've seen people get
two or three lives inside

390
00:20:05.330 --> 00:20:07.970
of a big company, but
at some point you usually,

391
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.230
you, you you're, it's the
law of diminishing returns. Yeah.

392
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.020
Within a company, you probably
get one. Sometimes you get

393
00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:17.480
more than one, but Right.
I mean, you, you know,

394
00:20:17.480 --> 00:20:19.670
you become a little bit
of like, like I may

395
00:20:19.670 --> 00:20:21.950
already be getting the, I
call it the chicken little

396
00:20:22.070 --> 00:20:24.680
syndrome, you know? Cause I'll
go in and I was

397
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:29.330
just like, this is awful.
It's all screwed up. And

398
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:34.580
people are like, well, no,
it's not that bad. So

399
00:20:34.580 --> 00:20:36.260
you have to be careful
because that after a while,

400
00:20:36.260 --> 00:20:38.870
people will be like, all
Hanselman does is complain about

401
00:20:38.870 --> 00:20:41.390
how awful it is. Well,
you that's right. You can't,

402
00:20:41.390 --> 00:20:43.700
you can't bitch all the
time. Right? I have a

403
00:20:43.820 --> 00:20:46.610
saying with my team that
someone is always bitching. And

404
00:20:46.610 --> 00:20:48.610
what mean by that for
our team is, you know,

405
00:20:48.610 --> 00:20:51.520
you're, you know, you're doing
something right. When somebody is

406
00:20:51.520 --> 00:20:53.980
telling you you're doing something
wrong, it's when you're doing

407
00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:55.600
something over and over again.
And no one tries to

408
00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:57.370
stop you where they want
to try to stop you,

409
00:20:57.370 --> 00:21:00.010
that you have a problem.
Right? That's that's when you

410
00:21:00.010 --> 00:21:04.150
got issues. And so you
can't, you certainly can't walk

411
00:21:04.150 --> 00:21:06.160
around saying, you know, this
is, this is broken. This

412
00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:09.140
is broken. As we gotta
be proactive and effective and

413
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:11.020
try not to piss on
everybody's pray. But at the

414
00:21:11.020 --> 00:21:13.660
same time, it's your job.
As the guy responsible for

415
00:21:13.660 --> 00:21:17.290
community to be in touch
with the pulse, to know

416
00:21:17.290 --> 00:21:19.930
what's going to be effective.
And to have that, have

417
00:21:19.930 --> 00:21:25.300
that data, whether it be
empirical or emotional, even based

418
00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.550
on your, based on your
relationships to know, or have

419
00:21:27.550 --> 00:21:30.210
a sense of what's going
to work or not. How

420
00:21:30.210 --> 00:21:33.630
do you balance when something
that you think is right,

421
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.380
and something that the company
thinks is thinks otherwise kind

422
00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:42.870
of like come in conflict
with each other, like recently

423
00:21:43.710 --> 00:21:45.250
there was this whole thing
about where people could, could

424
00:21:45.370 --> 00:21:47.370
unlock their phones. And it's,
it's a different kind of

425
00:21:47.370 --> 00:21:51.150
unlocking than you mentioned before,
before you mentioned the idea

426
00:21:51.150 --> 00:21:54.210
of developer unlocking, which means
that I can write an

427
00:21:54.210 --> 00:21:56.490
application and put it on,
they call it, they call

428
00:21:56.490 --> 00:21:58.170
it sideloading. Is that what
the word is? I can

429
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:04.050
put it on from the
side and then I can

430
00:22:04.050 --> 00:22:07.440
deploy visual studio. Right. And,
or my friend could send

431
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:09.660
me his app and I
could install it and test

432
00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:14.190
it for him. Right. And
then there's this other kind

433
00:22:14.190 --> 00:22:17.880
of unlocking. So what was
that unlocking? Yeah. You know,

434
00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:20.220
the guys, the Chevron team,
they, they, what they wanted

435
00:22:20.220 --> 00:22:23.370
to do was let anybody
unlock their phone. You know

436
00:22:23.370 --> 00:22:25.170
what I mean? Chevron, the
gas company, this is something

437
00:22:25.170 --> 00:22:28.140
that not Generally ask them,
Chevron WP seven was the

438
00:22:28.290 --> 00:22:31.050
website, but it's, it's Chris
Wallace and lungs and Rafael

439
00:22:31.050 --> 00:22:33.810
Rivera. It's the three smart
guys that said, Hey, you

440
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:36.600
know, we feel a little
bit encumbered by your system

441
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:38.210
and we're gonna, we're gonna
cut a, poke a hole

442
00:22:38.220 --> 00:22:40.860
in it and allow anybody
to, to unlock their phone.

443
00:22:40.860 --> 00:22:44.430
So they can side load
apps and whatnot. And you

444
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:46.770
know, what, what they really
kind of at the core

445
00:22:46.770 --> 00:22:49.470
were about was the, the
home brew community and allowing

446
00:22:49.470 --> 00:22:52.050
folks to kind of tinker
with their phone without necessarily

447
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:55.860
having to pay the $99.
And there's still some things

448
00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:57.300
we can't talk about yet
that we are working with

449
00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.810
those guys to, to enable
as we go down that

450
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:02.490
path, because it's a good
idea to work with the

451
00:23:02.490 --> 00:23:04.260
community and allow people, you
know, they paid for the

452
00:23:04.260 --> 00:23:07.830
phone, they're paying the contract,
they've downloaded the tools. Really

453
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:09.120
the issue is whether or
not the app gets in

454
00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.500
the marketplace, not whether or
not they can put the

455
00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:13.770
app on their own phone.
So we were trying to

456
00:23:13.770 --> 00:23:15.150
figure out how to do
that in a smart way,

457
00:23:15.150 --> 00:23:17.850
without causing all kinds of
havoc and the ecosystem at

458
00:23:17.850 --> 00:23:21.600
large. But, but you know,
my, when that went down,

459
00:23:21.630 --> 00:23:24.630
the knee jerk reaction to
Microsoft was, you know, send

460
00:23:24.630 --> 00:23:26.910
a cease and desist letter,
have the lawyer called and

461
00:23:26.910 --> 00:23:28.380
tell him to take it
down, blah, blah, blah. And

462
00:23:28.770 --> 00:23:30.480
you know, my reaction was,
well, hold on a second.

463
00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:33.120
Let's just, let's just hit
pause here. Let's try something

464
00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.190
crazy. Why don't we just
invite them out here and

465
00:23:35.190 --> 00:23:37.500
ask them what they're trying
to do and just have

466
00:23:37.500 --> 00:23:40.260
a conversation and kind of,
you know, let's just engage

467
00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.610
with them, right? I mean,
they obviously care a lot

468
00:23:41.610 --> 00:23:43.850
about the phone. They cared
enough to do this. I

469
00:23:43.890 --> 00:23:45.920
eventually guess they'd actually want
to hear more about what

470
00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:48.830
we're doing in the future,
et cetera. Let's, you know,

471
00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:50.930
let's just ask them nicely
to take it down. So

472
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.320
sending the lawyers and see
what happens. And it turns

473
00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:56.960
out when you ask nicely
the things happen, right? I

474
00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.030
mean, if you look at
the, I don't want to

475
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.180
say that necessarily Sony and
divided their problems on, but

476
00:24:02.210 --> 00:24:04.970
I mean, you know, they
had some challenges with, with

477
00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.950
a couple of hackers and
one of them even went

478
00:24:06.950 --> 00:24:09.380
so far as to say
you're damning yourselves with the

479
00:24:09.380 --> 00:24:12.350
hacker community on his blog
posts very publicly said, you

480
00:24:12.350 --> 00:24:13.700
know, the hackers are going
to come after you. And

481
00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:17.000
here we are, six months
later and their entire network

482
00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:20.720
was taken down, right. Folks
that care a lot about

483
00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.600
a platform, enough to poke
at it, you should embrace

484
00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:25.280
them. Right? I mean, there's,
there's a lot of learnings

485
00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:27.650
that can happen from embracing
the community and understanding what

486
00:24:27.650 --> 00:24:29.690
they're trying to do because
ultimately a lot of times

487
00:24:30.410 --> 00:24:31.820
I'd say almost nine times
out of 10, they actually

488
00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.830
just want to understand the
confines and the constraints of

489
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.870
the system and work around
it because it's an intellectual

490
00:24:38.870 --> 00:24:42.290
exercise. It's mentally stimulating. It's
not about being some Wallace,

491
00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.610
a brigand, that's trying to
break the business models of

492
00:24:47.050 --> 00:24:50.330
untoward companies. And so we
learned a lot from those

493
00:24:50.330 --> 00:24:51.740
guys and there's what they,
what they need and what

494
00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:53.210
they're trying to do. And
there's certainly some changes that

495
00:24:53.210 --> 00:24:55.190
we haven't announced yet that
we're going to, that we're

496
00:24:55.190 --> 00:24:57.860
looking to enact as a
result of, you know, working

497
00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.570
with them. And some other
folks that were, you know,

498
00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.670
I would guess you'd call
them, you know, part of

499
00:25:01.670 --> 00:25:07.780
this hacker community. So that's,
that's interesting because there's has

500
00:25:07.780 --> 00:25:11.680
been talk, I've seen in
comments, stuff that, that people

501
00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:14.890
are surprised with the way
that we're handling that, which

502
00:25:14.890 --> 00:25:17.170
is odd. Because for me,
it just seems like kind

503
00:25:17.170 --> 00:25:20.140
of common sense, right? I
mean, if the present, if

504
00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.810
you have a hacker and
the presumption is that they're

505
00:25:22.810 --> 00:25:27.310
not evil, well, then, you
know, if they're not evil,

506
00:25:27.310 --> 00:25:29.650
they might be something other
than evil. Let's just say,

507
00:25:30.850 --> 00:25:33.040
so call them on the
phone and talk to them

508
00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:36.190
about it. Which is funny
because I actually, people don't

509
00:25:36.190 --> 00:25:39.070
realize I do a lot
of community work on Skype

510
00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:41.440
and on, you know, people
think I just hang out

511
00:25:41.440 --> 00:25:43.810
on Twitter all day. Actually
Twitter is a reasonably small

512
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:47.080
part of my, my job,
but when, when things go

513
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:49.270
wrong or when I have
a company or a person

514
00:25:49.270 --> 00:25:51.910
or an open source project
that needs some support, inevitably

515
00:25:51.910 --> 00:25:54.160
I pick up the phone
and it's amazing to me

516
00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:57.610
how surprised they are that
will, that will do that.

517
00:25:57.760 --> 00:25:58.960
I mean, I'll literally just
pick up the phone and

518
00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.670
sometimes I'll even have to
go and hunt them down.

519
00:26:01.180 --> 00:26:04.030
You know, like they'll, it'll
be kind of involved. I'll

520
00:26:04.030 --> 00:26:05.530
have to go and find
the, you know, find their

521
00:26:05.650 --> 00:26:07.720
domain. You know, every once
in a while I'll kind

522
00:26:07.720 --> 00:26:10.540
of call him in the
middle of dinner. And when

523
00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.800
they realize that I am
also not evil or at

524
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:16.540
least not as evil as
they expected, I would be

525
00:26:17.170 --> 00:26:19.810
then think things seem to
diffuse, make me want, you

526
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:21.580
know, it kind of makes
me wonder why people like,

527
00:26:22.210 --> 00:26:24.250
you know, like Steve jobs,
right? He called him every

528
00:26:24.250 --> 00:26:25.420
once in a while, he'll
send an email, it's a

529
00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:28.390
big deal. Why doesn't he
have someone? He should have

530
00:26:28.390 --> 00:26:32.950
a whole team of people
calling For him. The mystique

531
00:26:32.980 --> 00:26:35.260
is the fact that he
responds very selectively. And I

532
00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:37.060
think that actually is, I
think it would, it would,

533
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.170
it would dead. And the
effectiveness of it, if he,

534
00:26:40.170 --> 00:26:42.340
if he, for him specifically,
he is a cult of

535
00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:45.240
personality for, but the point
that you raised, which is

536
00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.580
an interesting one, which is
about being available, right? So

537
00:26:47.850 --> 00:26:50.250
one of the, for, as
we go into our planning

538
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:51.840
for the next fiscal year,
because it starts in July

539
00:26:51.840 --> 00:26:53.490
one, one of the, one
of the new key principles

540
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:55.890
for my team is to
be highly available. And you

541
00:26:55.890 --> 00:26:58.080
said, you start all your
presentations by saying, I'm not

542
00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:00.090
here to sell you anything.
I actually start all my

543
00:27:00.090 --> 00:27:03.270
presentations with a little, little
code snippet that I wrote

544
00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.670
on a, on a whiteboard,
in a room full of

545
00:27:05.670 --> 00:27:07.290
a bunch of business guys
that, you know, the few

546
00:27:07.290 --> 00:27:09.540
engineers in the room got
it. And then they laughed

547
00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:11.430
about the fact that it
was maybe it was bad

548
00:27:11.430 --> 00:27:14.700
code, but, but the core
principle is make yourself highly

549
00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:18.030
available. So I publish my
email. I published my mobile

550
00:27:18.030 --> 00:27:20.880
phone number. You know, we
were going to start holding

551
00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:23.190
office hours where I'm just
on Skype for, you know,

552
00:27:23.190 --> 00:27:25.230
a 30 minutes, one hour
window. And anybody who wants

553
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:26.580
to talk to me can
just ring me up from

554
00:27:26.580 --> 00:27:28.410
around the world. And I
did a week ago or

555
00:27:28.410 --> 00:27:30.420
two weeks ago when I
was in town, got calls

556
00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.400
from all over the world.
People had questions about when

557
00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.710
his phone, about developing that,
you know, an idea that

558
00:27:34.710 --> 00:27:38.010
they wanted to suss out,
but that being highly available

559
00:27:38.010 --> 00:27:43.470
thing, it's amazingly disarming. It's
easy for people within Microsoft

560
00:27:43.470 --> 00:27:45.900
to feel like everyone hates
us, but they don't. They

561
00:27:45.900 --> 00:27:49.010
just it's. It's the, it's
the Microsoft, as a, as

562
00:27:49.010 --> 00:27:52.410
a corporate entity is a
baseless kind of thing. But

563
00:27:52.740 --> 00:27:55.890
when people outside of that,
veil can engage on a

564
00:27:55.890 --> 00:27:58.080
one on one basis with
people inside the company and

565
00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:01.020
realize that we're all geeks
and we all enjoy and

566
00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.730
love technology. And we're all
trying to do the right

567
00:28:02.730 --> 00:28:08.220
thing. It's amazingly disarming. And
if I can just turn

568
00:28:08.250 --> 00:28:11.370
one of those people into
calm and evangelists, but just

569
00:28:11.370 --> 00:28:13.470
a megaphone, right? Who's someone
who says, yeah, no, Hey,

570
00:28:13.470 --> 00:28:15.120
I talked to those guys
are actually pretty good guys.

571
00:28:15.450 --> 00:28:20.310
That's a huge win. It's
a huge win because I,

572
00:28:20.310 --> 00:28:22.950
I don't scale. I know
there's only one of me

573
00:28:22.950 --> 00:28:24.360
and I only have a
few people on my team

574
00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:26.820
and, you know, we can,
we can't do a worldwide

575
00:28:26.820 --> 00:28:28.890
thing, but if I can
kind of permeate this, this

576
00:28:28.890 --> 00:28:31.470
mental model of, Hey, make
yourself highly available and engage

577
00:28:31.470 --> 00:28:33.330
with people and actually pick
up the phone to do

578
00:28:33.330 --> 00:28:38.790
everything on email or Twitter,
make it personal. It it's,

579
00:28:38.880 --> 00:28:40.890
it's worked so far and
it can, you know, we're

580
00:28:40.890 --> 00:28:42.720
gonna kind of keep tweaking
and figuring out what works,

581
00:28:42.720 --> 00:28:45.540
but it's, it's very much
focused on, it's not about

582
00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:48.420
me. It's not about us.
It's about them. And when

583
00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:50.970
you, when you take that
mental model, it's not about

584
00:28:51.330 --> 00:28:52.620
for me, it's, you know,
it's great if we sell

585
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:54.510
more phones and that's awesome,
but for me, it's, I

586
00:28:54.510 --> 00:28:56.970
want developers to be successful.
And with that as a

587
00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.240
genuine mental model, it actually
comes through and is received

588
00:29:00.240 --> 00:29:02.010
versus, Hey, I'm trying to
sell you phones. And in

589
00:29:02.010 --> 00:29:03.480
order for me to earn,
I'm trying to sell more

590
00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.950
phones in order for me
to do that. I need

591
00:29:04.950 --> 00:29:07.590
you to build apps. That's
a very different mental model

592
00:29:07.590 --> 00:29:09.690
than I want you to
be really successful on our

593
00:29:09.690 --> 00:29:12.110
platform. Yeah. One of the
things that I've been doing

594
00:29:12.110 --> 00:29:14.480
in the last year, I
was like changed from productive

595
00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:18.560
to happiness because the older
I get, the less interested

596
00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.150
I am in being productive,
the more interesting, I mean,

597
00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:22.460
just generally happy. So I've
been telling people that I

598
00:29:22.460 --> 00:29:24.890
really want to optimize the
platform for happiness. And a

599
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.780
lot of people say that
I've stole that from, from

600
00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:30.020
rails or from Ruby, because
people always talk about how,

601
00:29:30.740 --> 00:29:32.840
you know, maths is nice
and we are nice and

602
00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:36.140
things like that. And rails
is about developer happiness. But

603
00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:38.480
I think just, I don't
think that happiness is something

604
00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:43.090
that a platform necessarily has
the, it has the control

605
00:29:43.150 --> 00:29:45.610
who has complete control over
you. Don't, there's no monopoly

606
00:29:45.610 --> 00:29:48.600
on happiness. Well, certainly. I
mean, how do you, how

607
00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:50.550
do you check in happiness?
And then who's responsible for

608
00:29:50.550 --> 00:29:52.380
the feature. And really, it
just turns into a big

609
00:29:52.410 --> 00:29:57.900
mess, Right. But, but happiness
does, you know, fall out

610
00:29:58.350 --> 00:30:02.160
of, of our, our, what
we're trying to do. I

611
00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:05.730
mean, I think about the
customer and I'm shocked sometimes

612
00:30:05.730 --> 00:30:07.530
that I have to remind
other people to think about

613
00:30:07.530 --> 00:30:12.960
the customer and just remember
that we are the customer

614
00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.820
too. And that's why I
talk about getting back to

615
00:30:14.820 --> 00:30:18.810
the beginning of the podcast,
talking about college hires. It's

616
00:30:18.810 --> 00:30:22.320
really, really important to, to
build a real app and

617
00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:24.510
to build a real app
every couple of months or

618
00:30:24.510 --> 00:30:28.440
a giant app, every couple
of years, it's very frustrating

619
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:31.830
to talk to someone at
Microsoft who hasn't ever built

620
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.660
a real app. They have
worked there for 20 years

621
00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:35.610
and buy a real app.
I mean, like, you know,

622
00:30:35.610 --> 00:30:37.920
go to work for like
an insurance company or a

623
00:30:37.920 --> 00:30:40.980
health agency or something massive,
you know what I mean?

624
00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:45.690
And just, just suffer for
a couple of years. Cause

625
00:30:45.750 --> 00:30:49.050
man, that's so important and
I've done that, gosh, now

626
00:30:49.860 --> 00:30:52.860
three, four times, you know,
big enterprise apps that like

627
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:56.160
just drag on for 18
months. Sure. And change twice

628
00:30:56.160 --> 00:31:00.480
during the process completely. You
know, I don't like C-sharp

629
00:31:00.510 --> 00:31:02.520
cause I can't read the
code. So we're going to

630
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:06.210
do this in visual basic.
Actually I worked in a

631
00:31:06.210 --> 00:31:08.820
place where we switched back
and forth C sharp PV,

632
00:31:08.820 --> 00:31:13.050
and then back. Yes. Lovely.
And that's the kind of

633
00:31:13.050 --> 00:31:15.810
craziness that, that you, you
can't even imagine when you

634
00:31:15.810 --> 00:31:19.860
are working inside. Yeah. You
know, it's, it's one of

635
00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.530
the curses of Microsoft is
that we are, or have

636
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:25.020
been historically a place where
you, you get, you know,

637
00:31:25.020 --> 00:31:26.610
the best of the brightest
and you're surrounded by really,

638
00:31:26.610 --> 00:31:29.440
really smart people. And, and
it's, you know, this, this,

639
00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:32.250
this statement may upset some
people, but the sad truth

640
00:31:32.250 --> 00:31:36.180
about mathematics is that is
an indisputable fact that 50%

641
00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:39.240
of the population is below
average intelligence. Once you come

642
00:31:39.240 --> 00:31:42.900
to peace with that, it's
very liberating in terms of

643
00:31:42.900 --> 00:31:48.240
how you approach certain problem
sets because we are in

644
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:52.440
some ways, not our best
customer. Right. And, and, and

645
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.330
certainly for my team, one
of the, one of the

646
00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:58.110
requirements is that you write
code for fun. I'm not

647
00:31:58.110 --> 00:32:01.440
sure how you can be
a developer platform marketing or

648
00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:05.580
product management person and not
write code for fun. Right.

649
00:32:05.580 --> 00:32:08.130
Because, you know, do you
understand, like if I say

650
00:32:08.130 --> 00:32:10.170
Murph, do you say this
isn't tight? Or do you

651
00:32:10.170 --> 00:32:14.280
say, no, that's not a
denote mongrel number. Right. If

652
00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:16.710
you don't understand those discussions,
you can't be authentic. Right.

653
00:32:16.710 --> 00:32:19.860
And it's very, very challenging.
And so we, to your

654
00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:22.470
point, it's like, okay, go
do something for fun. Go

655
00:32:22.470 --> 00:32:24.240
work on some fun app.
What is your stupid phone

656
00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:27.030
app that you're going to
go build? And it was

657
00:32:27.030 --> 00:32:29.430
one of the things I
implored, even our broader marketing

658
00:32:29.430 --> 00:32:31.860
team, just broadly the marketing
guys who have no coding

659
00:32:31.860 --> 00:32:33.420
experience at all. And I
was like, look, we make

660
00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:35.280
the claim that it's so
easy to build these apps.

661
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:37.230
You know, the tools are
so easy to use. We've

662
00:32:37.230 --> 00:32:39.800
kind of reached that Gutenberg
moment. Anybody can be an

663
00:32:39.800 --> 00:32:42.380
author and publish a book.
Well, you know, Hey, all

664
00:32:42.380 --> 00:32:43.850
of you who have never
written a line of code,

665
00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.600
go actually live the dream.
You know, download the tools

666
00:32:47.660 --> 00:32:51.200
because I used to race
motorcycles semi-professionally which means I

667
00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.510
paid more than I ever
made. But you know, if

668
00:32:53.510 --> 00:32:55.460
I talk about, if I
asked you to describe motorcycle

669
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.180
racing, you might say something
like, well, you know, you

670
00:32:58.430 --> 00:33:02.990
go on an arena of
concrete and you straddle a

671
00:33:03.020 --> 00:33:07.490
canister of explosive gas with
wheels. And you hurdle yourself

672
00:33:07.520 --> 00:33:09.380
around this arena of concrete
at high speed in close

673
00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:11.180
proximity to other people and
hope that you don't die.

674
00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:14.240
That that might be a
reasonable explanation of motorcycle racing.

675
00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:16.190
But you, but if you
talk to somebody who's actually

676
00:33:16.190 --> 00:33:18.440
done it, somebody lived it,
someone for whom it was

677
00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:20.960
a passion for me. And
my wife gets really annoyed

678
00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.450
when I say this, but
one of my happiest times

679
00:33:23.450 --> 00:33:26.360
in my life, and this
is including getting married and

680
00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:29.690
having kids, right. I was
sitting on the starting grid

681
00:33:30.920 --> 00:33:32.780
at, at the, at the
start of a race. And

682
00:33:32.870 --> 00:33:34.700
the two minute board goes
sideways to me, this is

683
00:33:34.710 --> 00:33:37.190
race about to start. And
all the reps of all

684
00:33:37.190 --> 00:33:38.720
the engines come up and
you're surrounded by a bunch

685
00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:40.250
of people that you race
with and you want to

686
00:33:40.250 --> 00:33:42.590
beat, but you respect. And
they're your competitors. All those

687
00:33:42.590 --> 00:33:45.140
engines come up to about
11,000, 12,000 RPMs, depending on

688
00:33:45.140 --> 00:33:47.030
what kind of bike racing.
But it gets really loud.

689
00:33:47.450 --> 00:33:50.150
Your vision gets incredibly focused.
You're looking down the track,

690
00:33:50.150 --> 00:33:51.650
you're staring at the lights,
you're waiting for them to

691
00:33:51.650 --> 00:33:54.260
go out and it's, you
know, it gives me goosebumps

692
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:57.500
to even talk about it.
That's the difference between, you

693
00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.560
know, describing something you've never
done and trying to sell

694
00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:04.070
it to other people and
describing an experience that you

695
00:34:04.070 --> 00:34:07.370
cared deeply about and wanting
to share it with other

696
00:34:07.370 --> 00:34:11.180
people. And so it's very
important that, that we as

697
00:34:11.630 --> 00:34:13.400
marketing people, but as people
that are responsible for the

698
00:34:13.400 --> 00:34:18.260
product, be authentic in what
we do. And that's been

699
00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.120
a huge part of our,
you know, kind of community

700
00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:22.520
outreach, anyone who's engaging with
the developer community has to

701
00:34:22.520 --> 00:34:26.270
be someone who understands their
problems and can actually describe

702
00:34:26.270 --> 00:34:28.570
and talk about things that
they've done or tried or

703
00:34:28.590 --> 00:34:30.350
can understand the problems that
are being described them. And

704
00:34:30.350 --> 00:34:33.320
then appropriately stack rank, how
important or difficult those challenges

705
00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:35.600
are when they come back
and say, Oh, we need

706
00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.610
to make this change because
this customer has this problem.

707
00:34:39.460 --> 00:34:41.920
Very cool. Very cool. Thanks
for talking to me. I

708
00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:44.950
appreciate it. It's nice. I
dunno. It's nice to meet

709
00:34:44.950 --> 00:34:48.010
you. Just another, another nut
job inside of Microsoft that

710
00:34:48.010 --> 00:34:50.980
thinks that they can push
against the rule for us

711
00:34:51.670 --> 00:34:54.580
and maybe, maybe change things.
So I appreciate that. You're

712
00:34:55.180 --> 00:34:56.980
what you're doing and that
you're keeping it real and

713
00:34:57.400 --> 00:35:01.120
Keeping it real. There's reaching
back into the night. Yeah.

714
00:35:01.270 --> 00:35:02.590
Give me a call if
you can, if you get

715
00:35:02.590 --> 00:35:05.650
canned. Okay. We can, we
can both slam our fist

716
00:35:05.650 --> 00:35:08.950
down on the table at
the same time. I'll say

717
00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.420
no, no, hold on. Hold
on. I can't be fired

718
00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:11.620
yet. I got to get
a handsome in a call.

719
00:35:11.890 --> 00:35:16.480
I want him here with
the cameras. Yes. All right.

720
00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:19.810
Thanks a lot. Alright. Hey,
thanks, man. This has been

721
00:35:19.810 --> 00:35:22.330
another episode of Hansel minutes
and I'll see you again

722
00:35:22.330 --> 00:35:22.840
next week.
