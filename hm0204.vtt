From Hansel minutes.com it's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

2
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.830
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

3
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:28.800
show number two Oh four.
Recorded live Tuesday, March 9th, 2010. Support

4
00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:31.980
for Hanselman. It's just provided
by Tellerik our Ady controls,

5
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.160
the most comprehensive suite of
components for windows forums and

6
00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:44.820
asp.net web applications online@wwwdottelerik.com. In
this episode, Scott talks with

7
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:50.820
social media consultant Leesburg. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman, and

8
00:00:50.820 --> 00:00:52.980
this is another episode of
Hansel minutes. And I'm sitting

9
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:55.470
down today with Liz <inaudible>.
Liz is a new media

10
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:58.860
consultant and entrepreneur and a
blogger, and I've actually met

11
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:00.990
Liz from Twitter. And I
thought it would be interesting

12
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.090
to bring her on the
show because most of us

13
00:01:03.090 --> 00:01:05.790
who are listening are programmers
or people who were involved

14
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:08.820
in technology, but Liz is
involved in what is called

15
00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:12.240
basically new media consultancy. Thank
you, Liz, for taking the

16
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.470
time to chat with me.
So you're a, you're a

17
00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.720
new media consultant, or maybe
would you call yourself a

18
00:01:18.720 --> 00:01:24.080
social media consultant? Well, social
media is definitely a part

19
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.570
of it. I do other
things. I mean, I used

20
00:01:26.690 --> 00:01:30.320
to be a front end
developer and designer, and so

21
00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:32.930
I kind of know how
to build a product from

22
00:01:32.930 --> 00:01:38.180
concept to final product. And,
you know, I assist my

23
00:01:38.180 --> 00:01:42.230
clients from, you know, their
ideas through the whole project

24
00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:47.240
management aspect to final final
product. And so some of

25
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:49.940
that entails social media because
that's a little bit of

26
00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:53.100
marketing and you know, other
things, I, you know, I,

27
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:55.910
I check code to see
if people are, if their

28
00:01:55.910 --> 00:01:59.690
developers are building crappy code
or, you know, I do

29
00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:01.520
a lot of QA work.
So I kind of do

30
00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:04.040
a lot of different things.
So social media is different

31
00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:07.700
part of it. Now you
went to MIT and you

32
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:11.180
have a background in what
MIT calls comparative media studies

33
00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:15.050
did. Did did this comparative
media studies degree prepare you

34
00:02:15.050 --> 00:02:18.800
for a job in new
media consultancy? I would say

35
00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.470
yes. I mean the comparative
media studies program at MIT

36
00:02:21.470 --> 00:02:24.680
used to be called film
and media studies. I'm going

37
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:26.540
to first back there and
then it kind of more

38
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:31.310
comparative. So there, I studied
things like music, film, television,

39
00:02:31.310 --> 00:02:36.470
books, theater, all kinds of
things across the board. And

40
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.290
of course digital studies is
definitely an important part of

41
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:43.190
that. I'm feeling a little
old because we didn't talk

42
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:45.890
that much about the web.
When I was at MIT,

43
00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.790
we were in the middle
of the first, the internet

44
00:02:49.790 --> 00:02:53.240
boom or whatever. And so
social media things hadn't come

45
00:02:53.240 --> 00:02:57.680
around. But what I liked
about my degree program and

46
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:00.310
a little bit why it
helps me today is that

47
00:03:00.730 --> 00:03:05.020
my classes were all new
classes. You know, like the

48
00:03:05.020 --> 00:03:06.610
classes that I took on
many of the classes that

49
00:03:06.610 --> 00:03:08.980
I've attended around for very
long. And I love to

50
00:03:08.980 --> 00:03:10.780
take all the new classes
that were there. And I

51
00:03:10.780 --> 00:03:15.070
think in some ways that
helped keep me interested in,

52
00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:18.340
you know, what's coming on
the horizon. And that's definitely

53
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.950
what I do today as
an immediate consultant. Things that

54
00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.830
I tell my clients to
do today are not things

55
00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:26.110
that I wouldn't have advised
them to do two or

56
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.440
three years ago. So, you
know, I think in some

57
00:03:29.440 --> 00:03:32.860
ways that helps in other
ways, you don't necessarily need

58
00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.430
a CMS degree from MIT.
Definitely not as so many

59
00:03:36.430 --> 00:03:41.620
people who don't have any
type of background immune studies

60
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:46.260
who do this. So yeah,
Now I personally have have

61
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:51.190
MIT issues and mostly it's
envy. I visited MIT in

62
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.610
the early, early nineties and
decided that it wasn't for

63
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.120
me, but I think of
MIT as being somewhere with

64
00:03:57.120 --> 00:03:59.400
a certain amount of rigidity.
And, you know, it has

65
00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:04.200
a reputation of being, you
know, pretty hardcore and as

66
00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.590
a person looking outside, you
know, looking into MIT, I

67
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.180
would think that there would
be a great deal of,

68
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.140
of formalism. And I guess,
you know, again, rigidity is

69
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.630
the word that comes to
mind. And I think of

70
00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:19.710
people at MIT, you know,
programming and doing hard analytics.

71
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:21.600
So when I think of
something like a media studies

72
00:04:21.990 --> 00:04:24.120
degree, and then applying that
to the field of new

73
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:27.180
media, it feels kind of
like what I call the

74
00:04:27.180 --> 00:04:30.240
soft skills, as opposed to
the hard skills. Like you

75
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:34.650
can't compile a, a new
media program, a new media

76
00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:38.580
PR plan and say, Oh
yeah, there are no errors.

77
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:44.310
This will run. Right. I
mean, I think a lot

78
00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:46.950
of the stuff that I
learned in my degree program

79
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.800
was a lot of theory.
And I say that jokingly

80
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.700
is I have my master's
degree at USC. And so

81
00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:56.400
I learned a lot of
theory in college, but I

82
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.830
didn't learn a lot of
things that I said apply

83
00:04:58.830 --> 00:05:01.710
in terms, at least in
terms of new media and

84
00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:05.370
the internet, I think. And
part of that has to

85
00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:09.720
do, I think through my
own initiative, I just didn't

86
00:05:09.720 --> 00:05:11.790
have a lot of initiative
when I was an undergrad,

87
00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:15.300
because MIT was really hard.
And there were just so

88
00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.700
many things. I mean, even
though I could kind of

89
00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:21.840
what sounds like these flipped
classes, I, I started out

90
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.120
as a biology major and,
you know, I was doing

91
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:26.910
research in chemistry labs and
all kinds of stuff. And

92
00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:30.780
every MIT student has to
go through a hard science

93
00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:34.860
score. So I think for
me at the time, I

94
00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:40.080
probably could've tried out some
things that were more application

95
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:42.360
heavy, but at the time
I was kind of, I

96
00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:43.920
was a little bit all
over the place just because

97
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.520
I wanted to make sure
that science wasn't what I

98
00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:51.690
wanted to do. And I
was definitely more into humanities

99
00:05:51.690 --> 00:05:56.760
and history and social and
stuff like that Is, is

100
00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.130
the, the formalism and the
hard science applied to social

101
00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:08.200
media and new media. You
know, I kind of have

102
00:06:08.200 --> 00:06:10.510
a heart issue with this
at times. Yes. There's of

103
00:06:10.510 --> 00:06:14.740
course. I mean, I definitely
do lots of analytics and

104
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:19.450
closing reports with my clients
when we do campaign or

105
00:06:19.450 --> 00:06:23.650
certain initiatives in terms of
looking at analytics. But at

106
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:27.160
the same time, I see
people who report these analytics

107
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.790
to, and I'm not necessarily
a hundred percent convinced that

108
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:33.580
they actually mean anything. It's
like, you know, so you

109
00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:37.720
have a tweet that you
sent out that reached 120,000

110
00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:43.780
people, 120,000 people actually read
that. And can you make

111
00:06:43.780 --> 00:06:49.180
that analogous to 120,000 people
seeing your billboard, you know,

112
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:52.300
down the street. So, so
sure. There's definitely a way

113
00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:55.000
to measure things, but in
terms of measuring how important

114
00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.550
those things are to people
who see them would not

115
00:06:57.550 --> 00:07:00.340
necessarily at that point yet
where we can make guarantees.

116
00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.460
So that's one of the
things that I struggle with.

117
00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:06.100
Cause my, in my job,
one of the things that

118
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.350
we track is how many
people that I, that I

119
00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:10.480
touch on the people that
I come in contact with,

120
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.830
but it's difficult to measure
the quantity of that touch.

121
00:07:14.860 --> 00:07:17.680
I mean, breadth is an
interesting measurement, but it's only

122
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:21.040
interesting for a few minutes
and it's really very superficial.

123
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.400
Right? Exactly. And I think,
you know, for me, that's

124
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.560
why I wanted to get
a master's I have a

125
00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:33.760
master's degree from USC journalism
school and online communities. And

126
00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:37.210
so that helps me in
the sense of learning, how,

127
00:07:38.470 --> 00:07:41.470
how people measure things, if
I'm a quantity or qualitative

128
00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:45.280
point of view. And, and
to some extent, I, I

129
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:48.400
like to, you know, of
course I have quantitative results,

130
00:07:48.430 --> 00:07:51.700
but I also do qualitative
analysis of the, of the

131
00:07:51.700 --> 00:07:55.150
data. And, you know, the
other issue I think is

132
00:07:55.150 --> 00:07:58.090
that the medium changes so
fast. And so, you know,

133
00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:02.020
Twitter has so many different
features now than it had

134
00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.590
a year ago versus two
years ago. And it's like

135
00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:09.160
the way people engage with
things on Twitter are constantly

136
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:11.470
changing. So you have to
change the way you measure

137
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:17.410
something qualitatively as well. Sometimes
when I think about a

138
00:08:17.410 --> 00:08:20.320
new media consultant, I think
of like the preppy guy

139
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:22.480
that I didn't get along
with in high school. And

140
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:24.700
I always think about like,
you know, he had nicer

141
00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:26.740
clothes and he would always
take his sweatshirt and like

142
00:08:26.770 --> 00:08:28.960
wrap it around his waist.
And it seems like the

143
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:32.110
nerds became programmers and the
popular preppy people became new

144
00:08:32.110 --> 00:08:36.910
media consultants. Right. I mean,
I honestly think that a

145
00:08:36.910 --> 00:08:40.590
lot myself and it's strange
because I feel, you know,

146
00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:45.490
myself clothing. I mean, I
definitely think some of that

147
00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:51.880
is rampant on online at
least. But I think for

148
00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:55.860
me, I just try to
keep, you know, I'm not

149
00:08:55.860 --> 00:08:58.530
one of those people who
is, I guess, always campaigning

150
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:01.680
about myself because I don't
necessarily want to come off

151
00:09:01.680 --> 00:09:03.570
as that person because I
see those people all the

152
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:07.860
time who are very good
at selling themselves, but don't

153
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.180
necessarily have any type of
hard skills that they learned

154
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:14.490
anywhere. And, you know, that's
fine. I'm not hating on

155
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:16.590
them, but I just don't
want to be perceived as

156
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:19.890
that person. So I'm very
careful about how I market

157
00:09:19.890 --> 00:09:24.030
myself, what I say about
myself, because yeah, totally on

158
00:09:24.030 --> 00:09:27.290
me, that person. Well, how
does one market themselves as

159
00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:29.390
a, as a new media
consultant? I mean, I could

160
00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.420
see if, if, if I'm
hiring you, I think, and

161
00:09:32.420 --> 00:09:34.280
I don't know much about
social media that I would

162
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:36.290
go on Twitter and I
would say, well, Hey, Liz,

163
00:09:36.290 --> 00:09:38.780
you only have 3000 followers.
You know, this other dude

164
00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:42.470
has a, has 150,000. Maybe
I should go with that

165
00:09:42.470 --> 00:09:48.680
guy. Right. I mean, I
often tell people if they

166
00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.360
want to go with that
guy, then go with that

167
00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:52.340
guy. But if you want
to talk to me and

168
00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.760
I can tell you about
myself and that's perfectly fine,

169
00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:58.670
I'm definitely, there's definitely enough
of us to go around.

170
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.750
I think a lot of
my clients that I have

171
00:10:02.750 --> 00:10:07.130
have no idea like how
important Twitter is in that

172
00:10:07.130 --> 00:10:10.130
sense. Like they might look
at followers as some of

173
00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:11.810
them don't even get that
far. So we won't go,

174
00:10:11.810 --> 00:10:13.940
I'll go to my profile.
I definitely don't always talk

175
00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:16.010
about social media on the
profile, talks about some of

176
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.000
the random things, but then
they also don't understand that

177
00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:22.520
someone with a hundred thousand
followers could have a hundred

178
00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:26.570
thousand people who aren't listening
to them. And that, and

179
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.510
that I think happens a
lot on Twitter. You know,

180
00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:32.660
everyone has a certain amount
of share of voice. And

181
00:10:32.660 --> 00:10:34.820
so we don't even know
what those numbers are, you

182
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:37.370
know, so if I have
a hundred thousand followers, does

183
00:10:37.370 --> 00:10:40.220
that mean that seven point
25% of them are listening

184
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:44.570
to me or, and you
know, is that person a

185
00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:47.330
percentage smaller or larger than
the people that listened to

186
00:10:47.330 --> 00:10:49.730
me? And then what's the
level of influence. And so,

187
00:10:50.810 --> 00:10:53.030
you know, I think for
many of my clients, they're

188
00:10:53.030 --> 00:10:55.580
not even on Twitter at
that point. And they come

189
00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.730
to me to help them
get on Twitter. So when

190
00:10:58.730 --> 00:11:00.590
a client comes to you,
what kind of problem do

191
00:11:00.590 --> 00:11:04.640
they have and why isn't
a classic marketing PR firm

192
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.460
handling it? And what is
that problem they have? And

193
00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:10.670
then how are you solving
it? Well, most of the

194
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:17.060
clients tend to be either
loggers or news and opinion

195
00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:20.840
sites or people with small
businesses. So I have a

196
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:23.630
different range because when I
say bloggers, usually people will

197
00:11:23.630 --> 00:11:26.660
have like 1.2 million pages
a day and it's a

198
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:29.960
blog, but it's a very
large blog or, you know,

199
00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:32.360
it's a new site that
it's not just, you know,

200
00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.790
two people working on a
website to have a whole

201
00:11:34.790 --> 00:11:38.930
staff of like 15. So,
but then again, I have

202
00:11:38.930 --> 00:11:41.930
like a small mom and
pop, you know, restoration company

203
00:11:41.930 --> 00:11:44.930
in New Jersey who knows, who
knows nothing about the internet,

204
00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:48.050
but they know that they
need a presence, but people

205
00:11:48.050 --> 00:11:50.480
come to me either if
they need a new website

206
00:11:51.140 --> 00:11:53.860
and they don't know where
to start, or they come

207
00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:55.450
to me, if they have
a new website idea and

208
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:57.370
they have money, they don't
have a lot of money,

209
00:11:57.820 --> 00:11:59.980
but they have, you know,
a considerable amount of money.

210
00:11:59.980 --> 00:12:02.500
So, you know, I've worked
on sites that are costs

211
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:06.340
$300,000 to produce. And some
of my clients might have

212
00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:07.870
that much money, but they
don't want to spend that

213
00:12:07.870 --> 00:12:10.090
much money on a new
site. So then, you know,

214
00:12:10.090 --> 00:12:14.620
they might have, let's say
$20,000 and they want to

215
00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.750
stretch that as far as
they can. And I think

216
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:22.510
for me, most of the
time value is to get

217
00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:25.810
a client the best that
they can for their money

218
00:12:25.900 --> 00:12:31.270
because agencies have a lot
of overhead. And I think

219
00:12:31.540 --> 00:12:34.240
sometimes they will charge you
a lot of money for,

220
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:37.840
you know, somewhat there'll be
beautiful sites, but they may

221
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:41.080
not be. So I said,
she can kick around or

222
00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:43.510
that will be very lasting
or that has very strong

223
00:12:43.510 --> 00:12:47.050
SEO. And I think for
me as a former front

224
00:12:47.050 --> 00:12:48.880
end developer, I can look
at code and I can

225
00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.710
tell, you know, this is
a very crappy code. Like

226
00:12:50.710 --> 00:12:53.680
this isn't tables is horrible,
or, you know, I could

227
00:12:53.680 --> 00:12:56.590
say, you know what? You
have way many did layers

228
00:12:56.590 --> 00:12:59.590
in this, you know, on
your code and you need

229
00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:03.070
to improve these and use
H one tags instead. And

230
00:13:03.070 --> 00:13:08.710
so some of my clients
they'll often find freelance developers

231
00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:12.040
because that's, what's cheaper for
them, but they don't necessarily

232
00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:14.830
know if that freelance developer
is as good as the

233
00:13:14.830 --> 00:13:17.080
money that they have for
them. So I kind of

234
00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:19.570
come in and be like,
yes, this is the person,

235
00:13:19.570 --> 00:13:21.460
no, this is a good
person. Or no, this is

236
00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:24.010
a bad person. Or, you
know, I'll tell them, this

237
00:13:24.010 --> 00:13:26.110
is, you need a person
with this type of skillset,

238
00:13:27.250 --> 00:13:30.400
you know, as a server
admin. And that's kind of

239
00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:33.340
like the flexibility and the
value that I have to

240
00:13:33.340 --> 00:13:37.650
offer for many of my
clients. Do you find that

241
00:13:37.680 --> 00:13:40.080
most of the social media
people that you bump into

242
00:13:40.080 --> 00:13:43.170
and this in the circles
that you run in are

243
00:13:43.560 --> 00:13:48.180
former developers? No, not at
all. Are they just smooth

244
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.330
talkers? I think they're smooth
talkers and you know what?

245
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:54.180
I definitely would admit that
I am not a smooth

246
00:13:54.210 --> 00:13:57.300
talker and it's definitely one
of my faults. I think

247
00:13:57.300 --> 00:13:59.280
I don't want to be
a super smooth talker, but,

248
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:01.140
you know, I don't think
I marked it myself as

249
00:14:01.140 --> 00:14:03.270
well as I could. Part
of that might be because

250
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:07.680
I'm shy or I have
very high expectations for myself.

251
00:14:07.680 --> 00:14:09.360
And I, you know, I
don't want to lie to

252
00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.340
people and tell them something
that I'm not or something

253
00:14:11.340 --> 00:14:14.910
that I'm not 120% sure
that I am. And so,

254
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.430
you know, I do find
that a lot of people

255
00:14:17.430 --> 00:14:20.070
don't have any technical chops
and, you know, they're kind

256
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:23.580
of talking about a lot
of theory or regurgitating things

257
00:14:23.580 --> 00:14:26.910
that they've read online and,
you know, it's not bad

258
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.220
to read online, but you
know, read what you see

259
00:14:29.220 --> 00:14:33.750
online, but then also apply
that to, you know, what

260
00:14:33.750 --> 00:14:35.970
you have to offer as
well. Don't just copy it

261
00:14:35.970 --> 00:14:37.950
and then try to make
a quick buck off somebody.

262
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.610
So a shy social media
consultant, but I'm looking at

263
00:14:41.610 --> 00:14:44.490
a picture of you on
stage at South, by Southwest

264
00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:47.880
interactive on what looks like
a panel of some kind.

265
00:14:48.930 --> 00:14:52.460
Yes, I was on a
panel last year where I

266
00:14:52.460 --> 00:14:57.830
talked about can black bloggers
survive in the age of

267
00:14:57.830 --> 00:15:01.670
Obama? The thing about me
is I also started blogging

268
00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:05.840
really early and that's in
fall 2002 and it was

269
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:08.960
just kind of early for
most people. And that's actually

270
00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:10.910
incidentally how I learned how
to code and also the

271
00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:12.490
kind of stuff in the
turn into a hobby and

272
00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.180
or career, et cetera, et
cetera. So black bloggers online

273
00:15:17.180 --> 00:15:20.840
has definitely had a presence,
but a lot of times

274
00:15:21.920 --> 00:15:24.620
I would say until maybe
the last few years, nobody

275
00:15:24.620 --> 00:15:28.310
really paid attention to them.
So yeah, that was our

276
00:15:28.310 --> 00:15:31.760
panel last year at South
by Southwest and I was

277
00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:35.060
shy, then I'm going to
South by Southwest this week

278
00:15:35.060 --> 00:15:39.040
and I will continue to
be shy. Hi, this is

279
00:15:39.040 --> 00:15:41.710
Scott Hanselman from another parallel
universe, got to tell you

280
00:15:41.710 --> 00:15:43.570
about some of our things
our sponsors are doing. They

281
00:15:43.570 --> 00:15:47.530
make this free podcast possible.
If you're developing a new

282
00:15:47.530 --> 00:15:50.140
line of business application, you've
probably tried the latest version

283
00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:52.630
of server light. Now you
can get even better results

284
00:15:52.630 --> 00:15:55.690
by combining the functionality and
server Lite for beta, with

285
00:15:55.690 --> 00:15:57.640
some of the richness or
the third party controls from

286
00:15:57.640 --> 00:16:01.030
our friends at Tellerik, they're
the first vendors to offer

287
00:16:01.030 --> 00:16:03.100
native support for the server
Lite for beta and their

288
00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:06.280
rad controls. You've got a
new Silverlight for CTP suite

289
00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:09.010
of these controls. They let
you tap into the frameworks,

290
00:16:09.010 --> 00:16:11.290
great potential. You got native
right mouse click and all

291
00:16:11.290 --> 00:16:14.510
the new features is server
line. There's 38 controls that

292
00:16:15.010 --> 00:16:17.260
give you all these features.
You can start building those

293
00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.320
compelling line of business applications
right away. I encourage you

294
00:16:20.320 --> 00:16:25.120
to check those products out
at tellerik.com/server light, and, you

295
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:28.000
know, thank Tellerik for supporting
Don and rock supporting Hansel

296
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.140
minutes on their Facebook fan
page at facebook.com/tellerik. Now back

297
00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:36.220
to the show. So what,
what is, what is South

298
00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:38.440
by Southwest? I mean, everyone
I follow on Twitter is

299
00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:42.190
going, people are asking me
why I'm not going, this

300
00:16:42.190 --> 00:16:44.710
is a music festival that
turned into some kind of

301
00:16:44.710 --> 00:16:48.280
a Scoble thing or what,
what are y'all doing? I

302
00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:50.500
mean, I just don't get,
I just try to get

303
00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:52.090
my head. I mean, I'm
having you on the show

304
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.700
so I can get my
sense about what are you

305
00:16:54.700 --> 00:16:59.380
all doing down there? Yes.
Well, you know, I've been

306
00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:03.730
reading about South by Southwest
interactive, probably for about five

307
00:17:03.730 --> 00:17:06.070
years online. So all the
bloggers that I used to

308
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:07.720
love back in the day
used to go and they'd

309
00:17:07.720 --> 00:17:09.400
have all these reports and
be like, Oh, I really

310
00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.860
want to go back, man.
I wanted to go because

311
00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:13.780
I was a developer and
a designer and they had

312
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:18.550
a lot of really good
panels from people that I

313
00:17:18.550 --> 00:17:21.490
followed in the industry who
were on panels. And so

314
00:17:21.490 --> 00:17:23.200
I thought it would be
great just to kind of

315
00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.220
absorb the knowledge and I
liked going to conferences in

316
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.080
general. So originally my interest
came from that, but then

317
00:17:32.080 --> 00:17:34.270
I saw kind of like
the black fathers that I

318
00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:38.440
followed started talking about race
and identity and they had

319
00:17:38.440 --> 00:17:41.560
panels at South by Southwest.
And so that was another

320
00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:44.440
interesting thing for me as
well. So lately, I mean,

321
00:17:44.440 --> 00:17:46.330
I kinda think of it
as like a nerd spring

322
00:17:46.330 --> 00:17:49.710
break. And it's like, all
of your friends, you met

323
00:17:49.710 --> 00:17:52.680
online over the past year
of the past few years

324
00:17:53.850 --> 00:17:56.640
at South by Southwest. And
they say it's a big

325
00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:58.770
time for networking and all
kinds of stuff. But me

326
00:17:58.770 --> 00:18:01.050
being a shy person, I'm
not big on networking, but

327
00:18:01.050 --> 00:18:03.240
I am big on connecting
with the people that I've

328
00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:07.410
met online in real life.
In addition, you know, I

329
00:18:07.410 --> 00:18:10.110
used to work for PDFs
station here in Los Angeles

330
00:18:10.650 --> 00:18:13.590
and I've had a lot
of coworkers that I met

331
00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:18.750
with my station as well
as PBS headquarters. And so

332
00:18:18.750 --> 00:18:20.640
they come as well. And
so for me, it's a

333
00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:24.480
great place to see old
coworkers people I went to

334
00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.900
grad school with is all
of my new friends. And,

335
00:18:28.500 --> 00:18:30.180
you know, honestly I wasn't
going to go this year

336
00:18:30.180 --> 00:18:33.290
because I was kind of
a little annoyed with the

337
00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:37.530
guy with the sweater, like
too cool. And I felt

338
00:18:37.530 --> 00:18:40.590
that I didn't want to
see those people online all

339
00:18:40.590 --> 00:18:42.390
the time. I didn't want
have to pay money to

340
00:18:42.390 --> 00:18:45.390
see them in person, but,
you know, once I realized

341
00:18:45.390 --> 00:18:47.580
that, you know, there's a
lot of people going every

342
00:18:47.580 --> 00:18:50.700
year that I've met online,
I want to see those

343
00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.430
people in person and it's
fun. It's fun to see

344
00:18:53.430 --> 00:18:56.340
the panels. It's fun to
meet people and it's kind

345
00:18:56.340 --> 00:18:59.630
of experience Austin. So One
of the things that you

346
00:18:59.630 --> 00:19:01.160
brought up was that you
were, you were meeting black

347
00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:04.400
bloggers and in your biracial
you're half black and half

348
00:19:04.400 --> 00:19:09.860
Navajo, is that correct? And
one of the things, you

349
00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.470
know, of course my wife
is, is black and I'm

350
00:19:12.470 --> 00:19:14.720
steeped in black culture. And
I spend a lot of

351
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.400
time studying African American studies
in college. And that was

352
00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.750
kind of the direction I
was going to go before

353
00:19:20.750 --> 00:19:24.950
I went with a software
actually. But yeah, it was

354
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:27.860
just kind of, kind of
a whole other show. But

355
00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.420
one of the things that
I don't think the average

356
00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:34.460
white folks on Twitter understand
is that black people really

357
00:19:34.730 --> 00:19:39.530
love social media. Like black
folks are 13 to 14%

358
00:19:39.530 --> 00:19:42.020
of the population, but isn't
it, what are the stats

359
00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.370
right now? It's like 30%
Really high. I mean, I'm

360
00:19:46.370 --> 00:19:49.790
not really sure where they
all came from because when

361
00:19:49.790 --> 00:19:53.150
I started online, it was
like the wild, wild West.

362
00:19:53.210 --> 00:19:56.720
Like when I first started
my blog, I mainly sought

363
00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.690
out people of color to
connect with because I didn't

364
00:19:59.690 --> 00:20:02.720
have a lot of them
in my everyday life to

365
00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:05.600
connect with. And the same
thing happened when I joined

366
00:20:05.630 --> 00:20:11.060
Twitter in 2007, I mostly
followed black people because at

367
00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.490
that time, the black people
on there were mostly tech

368
00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:16.250
people like me. And so
it was great to connect

369
00:20:16.250 --> 00:20:22.550
with people of similar career
or hobby interests that were

370
00:20:22.550 --> 00:20:24.860
also of color just because
you're not used to seeing

371
00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:28.820
them all the, you know,
in your everyday life. But

372
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.270
now it's very different. I
was reading this article and

373
00:20:32.270 --> 00:20:34.250
ad AIDS a few weeks
ago and it was just

374
00:20:34.250 --> 00:20:38.240
talking about how, not only
are black people, probably in

375
00:20:38.240 --> 00:20:41.540
their twenties taking over Twitter,
but they happen to be

376
00:20:41.540 --> 00:20:45.290
very good at internet means.
Cause you've seen those trending

377
00:20:45.290 --> 00:20:48.910
topics. Well, this is the
thing. I mean, people don't

378
00:20:48.910 --> 00:20:53.110
realize that the trending topics
appear to be pretty much

379
00:20:53.110 --> 00:20:58.930
handled by young, predominantly black
plugged in people. I mean,

380
00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:02.560
it's, it's, it's, I don't
think it's representative Mads is

381
00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:04.450
the part I don't realize.
Right. I don't understand. Is

382
00:21:04.450 --> 00:21:09.160
it representative of actual trending
topics or is it skewed

383
00:21:09.400 --> 00:21:14.940
with a more, you know,
a more urban audience Probably

384
00:21:14.970 --> 00:21:21.450
trending topics. But I think
that, I think that's what

385
00:21:21.480 --> 00:21:25.620
the younger African-American demographic using
them. They're kind of obsessive

386
00:21:25.620 --> 00:21:27.810
with it. Like if I
see a trending topic I'm

387
00:21:27.870 --> 00:21:31.110
in general, I might tweet
about that topic three times

388
00:21:31.110 --> 00:21:34.800
tops, you know, and I
may not even use a

389
00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.950
hashtag, but I have definitely
friends in this demographic and

390
00:21:37.950 --> 00:21:42.210
they will ride this hashtag
out. They will like produce

391
00:21:42.330 --> 00:21:45.420
30 to 40 tweets about
this one topic in the

392
00:21:45.420 --> 00:21:49.740
span of like five minutes.
So, you know, I think

393
00:21:49.740 --> 00:21:53.280
they might be, you know,
a little bit more into

394
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:55.680
it, I think, than everyone
else. I think when turning

395
00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.980
topics first came out, you
know, everyone was using it,

396
00:21:59.490 --> 00:22:01.770
you know, just to weigh
in once or twice. But

397
00:22:01.770 --> 00:22:04.680
I don't think that, I
don't know, like I said,

398
00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:09.060
I think it's, this demographic
might be really into participating

399
00:22:09.060 --> 00:22:13.140
in meme probably more so
than the average user for

400
00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:16.110
a different type of trending
topics. You know? And I

401
00:22:16.110 --> 00:22:18.180
think this thing about being
obsessive is a really interesting

402
00:22:18.180 --> 00:22:20.580
thing because this is a
group of group of people.

403
00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.410
And I don't mean black
folks, but I mean, obsessive

404
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:26.670
young people that I think
may not be served appropriately

405
00:22:26.670 --> 00:22:28.950
by social media. And they're
there, there, I was going

406
00:22:28.950 --> 00:22:31.320
to say abusing the system,
but they're, they're sitting on

407
00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.630
the system. People let me
put it this way. People

408
00:22:33.630 --> 00:22:38.130
think that I tweet way
too much. Like if you

409
00:22:38.130 --> 00:22:40.110
asked my followers, they'd be
like, Scott, you have a

410
00:22:40.110 --> 00:22:44.010
problem. Okay. But I started,
I don't know something like

411
00:22:44.010 --> 00:22:49.260
may of 2007, I just
hit 20,000 tweets yesterday, 20,000,

412
00:22:49.950 --> 00:22:54.210
you know? So I hit
20,000, right? I know people

413
00:22:54.750 --> 00:22:58.650
on Twitter who are 60,
70, 80,000. And they started

414
00:22:58.650 --> 00:23:02.550
last year. I know one
particular individual who I think,

415
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.820
you know, as well, who
has three or four accounts

416
00:23:05.910 --> 00:23:09.600
so that when she is
limited, not by the API

417
00:23:09.780 --> 00:23:12.150
count of Twitter, but by
Twitter saying you've tweeted too

418
00:23:12.150 --> 00:23:17.250
much. She has what are
called jail accounts. So and

419
00:23:17.250 --> 00:23:20.310
so in jail. So, and
so's lawyer. So, and so

420
00:23:20.310 --> 00:23:23.640
his lawyer in jail and
she asks her followers to

421
00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:25.740
follow these other people so
that when Twitter shuts her

422
00:23:25.740 --> 00:23:29.160
down again, not from API
calls, this is a different

423
00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:32.700
limit. This is the too
many tweets, too fast that

424
00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.860
you follow her additional. And
this is not just one

425
00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.830
individual. This is becoming a
thing. People are using Twitter

426
00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:42.510
as IRC, right? This is
chat and they don't realize,

427
00:23:42.550 --> 00:23:47.870
and I think it may
be these obsessive individuals who

428
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.720
are making the realtime search
of Twitter pretty much useless

429
00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:55.760
because it's pretty high, high
noise, low signal. What, what

430
00:23:55.760 --> 00:23:59.290
do you think? I think
that, well, I think one

431
00:23:59.290 --> 00:24:02.110
of the great things about
social media is that, and

432
00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:04.300
part of it is also
applied to the internet is

433
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.480
that there are no rules
that come in. And so

434
00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:11.410
the limits, your limits are
pretty much as limiting as

435
00:24:11.410 --> 00:24:14.200
the application can be, or
in the case of your

436
00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.090
example of the girl with
multiple or the person with

437
00:24:16.090 --> 00:24:21.670
multiple accounts as limiting as
your imagination can be. And

438
00:24:21.670 --> 00:24:25.390
so, you know, of course
that definitely that type of

439
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.840
behavior to me is useless,
but they find value in

440
00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.920
it somehow. And I have
a friend who, you know,

441
00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:34.780
who is of this demographic
and I have her going

442
00:24:34.780 --> 00:24:36.520
to my phone. Cause I
only have certain amount of

443
00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:39.070
people whose tweets go to
my phone as a text

444
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:41.890
message. And I swear when
she gets on, I have

445
00:24:41.890 --> 00:24:44.680
to go on and put
her on pause because she

446
00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:48.940
will just run up my
whole text, my phone for

447
00:24:48.940 --> 00:24:50.980
the next 30 minutes. And
it's great. I love her.

448
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.990
I, so I'm not going
to unfollow her, but I

449
00:24:52.990 --> 00:24:56.020
can imagine if I was
following like 50 people, just

450
00:24:56.020 --> 00:25:00.460
like her, it would drive
me insane. So when we,

451
00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:02.650
when we're trying, when it's,
when it comes time to,

452
00:25:03.010 --> 00:25:07.810
to market to someone who's
that savvy, is it, is

453
00:25:07.810 --> 00:25:10.210
it even possible? I mean,
this is the thing you're

454
00:25:10.210 --> 00:25:12.460
supposed to go out as
a consultant and think about

455
00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:18.070
new ways to effectively either
sell to or message, you

456
00:25:18.070 --> 00:25:22.420
know, the, the masses, but
the masses are incredibly sophisticated

457
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:24.730
and, and something that you
used once may never work

458
00:25:24.730 --> 00:25:29.950
again. Right. You know, I
think part of what I

459
00:25:29.950 --> 00:25:32.740
have to do and, and
this isn't even like billable

460
00:25:32.740 --> 00:25:34.900
time, but things that I
do is I have to

461
00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.210
stay on top of how
the market is changing. And

462
00:25:37.210 --> 00:25:41.380
what's changing about features on
whatever site, whether that's Facebook

463
00:25:41.380 --> 00:25:45.580
and their privacy controls or
Twitter, and, you know, the

464
00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:50.470
API changes, I think, you
know, so anyone who's a

465
00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:53.530
new media consultant. Now, if
they're not on top of

466
00:25:53.530 --> 00:25:58.000
their game, they can't necessarily
stay new media consultant for

467
00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:01.630
many years just because, unless
I was doing something to

468
00:26:01.630 --> 00:26:06.610
stay on top of their
game, I think, I think

469
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.310
you also have to stay
on top of what, you

470
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.800
know, how people are using
it. And so that demographic

471
00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:15.520
that we're just talking about,
one of my clients totally

472
00:26:15.880 --> 00:26:19.270
feeds off of that demographic.
And so for me, it's

473
00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.060
great because you know, I've
had this client for about

474
00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:25.210
two years now and I'd
say about two years ago,

475
00:26:25.210 --> 00:26:27.790
they weren't even thinking about
Twitter at all. So if

476
00:26:27.790 --> 00:26:30.580
I had tried to pitch
them a Twitter strategy, they

477
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:32.230
would have been like, Oh,
well, I don't want to

478
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:34.930
devote any resources to that
right now, my demographics mess

479
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:37.750
there, but now the totally
on top of it. And

480
00:26:37.750 --> 00:26:41.110
I'm totally getting more business
from them across many of

481
00:26:41.110 --> 00:26:43.740
their sites because they're like
no need to tap into

482
00:26:43.740 --> 00:26:47.220
that demographic ASAP. But you
know, I can't control whether

483
00:26:47.220 --> 00:26:50.130
or not, you know, tomorrow
they decide or, you know,

484
00:26:50.130 --> 00:26:52.980
this demographic moves on to
another, another side that I

485
00:26:52.980 --> 00:26:57.170
have to control them from
there. I was reading on

486
00:26:57.170 --> 00:27:00.080
your blog that you had
noticed something that the actor

487
00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.720
and singer Tyrese had done.
And you, you kind of

488
00:27:02.720 --> 00:27:07.130
juxtaposed his initial kind of
pathetic attempt at Twitter to

489
00:27:07.130 --> 00:27:09.110
something that he'd done kind
of recently. Could you talk

490
00:27:09.110 --> 00:27:11.420
a little bit about how,
how he has learned how

491
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:14.450
to use Twitter and what
you think about that? Yeah.

492
00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:16.550
Okay. So I see me
about a year, a year

493
00:27:16.550 --> 00:27:18.560
and a half ago. I
can't remember, but I was

494
00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:22.490
following MC hammer and his
time I saw Tyrese jump

495
00:27:22.490 --> 00:27:25.760
onto empty Hammer's Twitter account
and say follow Tyrese right

496
00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.800
now. And at the time
I was like, you know,

497
00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:30.170
I like retirees. I like
his music, but I don't

498
00:27:30.170 --> 00:27:32.270
like, he sounds like a
jerk coming on MC hammer

499
00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:36.050
account and demanding people to
follow him. It was just

500
00:27:36.500 --> 00:27:38.570
very odd. And so I
test that as Twitter for

501
00:27:38.570 --> 00:27:41.120
you. And it wasn't that
exciting either. So I decided

502
00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.370
not to follow him, you
know, I might check in

503
00:27:43.370 --> 00:27:45.650
on people every now and
then, but I wasn't going

504
00:27:45.650 --> 00:27:52.190
to follow him continually. So
I've realized a few weeks

505
00:27:52.190 --> 00:27:54.830
ago I was reading one
of the popular gossip blogs,

506
00:27:54.830 --> 00:27:57.920
and they had mentioned that
he had done a Valentine's

507
00:27:57.920 --> 00:28:01.760
day Twitter campaign. And so
I checked it out and

508
00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:04.640
it was one of them
like most interesting campaigns that's

509
00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:10.430
probably seen from, I'd say
this circle, what Tyrese did

510
00:28:10.430 --> 00:28:14.330
is he had a Valentine's
day contest where he wanted

511
00:28:14.330 --> 00:28:17.450
people to nominate single mothers
who were in the LA

512
00:28:17.450 --> 00:28:21.830
area for Valentine's day Z.
And I think he ran

513
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.860
this for a few days
on, on his Twitter account.

514
00:28:24.890 --> 00:28:28.910
And he had a few,
he had 1100 single mothers

515
00:28:28.910 --> 00:28:32.000
who were entered into the
contest and he picked 14

516
00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.160
of them and he brought
them to this day slot

517
00:28:34.190 --> 00:28:37.460
in Beverly Hills and, you
know, just treated them to

518
00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:41.600
a nice day of spa
stuff like massages and pedicures

519
00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:44.690
and stuff. And he videotaped
the whole thing and, you

520
00:28:44.690 --> 00:28:46.430
know, had it, cut it
and put it on YouTube.

521
00:28:46.970 --> 00:28:48.980
And, you know, I thought
it was a really good

522
00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.170
example of how someone could
really run a strong Twitter

523
00:28:54.170 --> 00:28:59.270
contest. You know, even though
it 1100 people were participating,

524
00:28:59.270 --> 00:29:01.220
I don't know how many
followers he had, but people

525
00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:05.120
were definitely reading about this.
And I thought, what was

526
00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:07.010
great is that it didn't
feel like he was selling

527
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.200
anything. Like he, wasn't trying
to get people to go

528
00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:12.830
to this spa from the
video, you kinda get the

529
00:29:12.830 --> 00:29:15.170
impression that he paid for
this. So it wasn't also

530
00:29:15.170 --> 00:29:18.170
that he had some sort
of deal with a spa.

531
00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:21.320
Cause usually when you see
something like this online, it's,

532
00:29:21.470 --> 00:29:23.930
you know, some brand or
some company cutting people with

533
00:29:23.930 --> 00:29:27.470
deal to create this campaign.
And, you know, it's a

534
00:29:27.890 --> 00:29:31.850
pony and pony show, but,
you know, he was just

535
00:29:31.970 --> 00:29:35.930
being a nice person and,
you know, I thought that

536
00:29:35.930 --> 00:29:39.350
was great. He was just
being himself. And for me

537
00:29:39.350 --> 00:29:41.030
that felt like, you know
what, I might want to

538
00:29:41.050 --> 00:29:44.470
follow him now. He seems
like, you know, not a

539
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.110
jerk. Like I first had
the impression of him and,

540
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:50.170
you know, he seems interested
in trying to help people

541
00:29:50.170 --> 00:29:55.590
out, but yeah, very good
job. That was his goal.

542
00:29:55.590 --> 00:29:58.290
Then that as a personality,
as a, as an actor

543
00:29:58.290 --> 00:30:00.810
and as, as, as a
singer, his goal is to

544
00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:03.390
engender good feelings and like
what he is selling is

545
00:30:03.390 --> 00:30:08.190
himself. So now that you've
slightly changed your opinion of

546
00:30:08.190 --> 00:30:10.410
Tyrese as being kind of
a pompous jerk. And I

547
00:30:10.430 --> 00:30:13.370
know that was very nice,
you know, that, that, that

548
00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:16.830
he has officially sold you
something. Yeah. Yeah. And I

549
00:30:16.830 --> 00:30:19.080
mean, I really like five,
so I might check out

550
00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.520
this place that I went
to, I had to like

551
00:30:20.550 --> 00:30:23.580
rewind, rewind the tape to
get the names. He didn't

552
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.820
even pop the name of
the spot. The other thing

553
00:30:26.820 --> 00:30:30.060
is that, you know, tidy
is like the good looking

554
00:30:30.060 --> 00:30:33.330
singer slash actor. So of
course he wants to like,

555
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:36.840
you know, play to the
ladies a little bit. So

556
00:30:36.840 --> 00:30:39.270
I think he was, you
know, he wasn't like giving

557
00:30:39.270 --> 00:30:42.930
free dates to men or
anything like that, or, you

558
00:30:42.930 --> 00:30:45.120
know, it was definitely kind
of to get women in

559
00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.180
their soft spots. And so
I think that's part of

560
00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.050
his brand in general. So
without having to sell me

561
00:30:52.050 --> 00:30:55.740
some brand outright, he definitely
sold me on Tyrese, the

562
00:30:55.740 --> 00:31:00.870
person who is good for
women. Do you think that

563
00:31:00.870 --> 00:31:03.930
there is a Lezberger who
is working for Tyrese who

564
00:31:03.930 --> 00:31:06.080
made that decision or did
you think Tyree stumbled on

565
00:31:06.090 --> 00:31:10.830
this himself? Yeah, I think,
I think it might be

566
00:31:10.830 --> 00:31:14.220
a mixture. And, and what
I've been seeing with celebrities

567
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:18.420
online, at least Africana, urban
African-American urban celebrities is that

568
00:31:18.750 --> 00:31:22.530
they have these interesting ideas.
They don't necessarily have all

569
00:31:22.530 --> 00:31:26.190
the tools to put everything
together. So I think, you

570
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:29.070
know, Tyrese in general, like
his episode was the MC

571
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:32.100
hammer thing. I think he
was interested in Twitter. He

572
00:31:32.100 --> 00:31:34.110
just didn't know exactly what
he needed to do. It's

573
00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.630
kind of not appear to
be a jerk. And so

574
00:31:36.630 --> 00:31:39.720
he either he learned over
time, you know, what was

575
00:31:39.720 --> 00:31:42.210
the right thing to do?
Or he had someone clue

576
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:45.090
him in someone like me
who would clue him in,

577
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:47.100
on what to do. And
so it was the same

578
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:51.030
thing. I think a lot
of these types of celebrities

579
00:31:51.030 --> 00:31:53.670
have someone who's like the
nerd of the group. It

580
00:31:53.670 --> 00:31:56.730
might just be their friend.
Who's kind of like, you

581
00:31:56.730 --> 00:31:59.490
know, puts on the social
media, new media, consultancy hat

582
00:32:00.030 --> 00:32:02.790
and helps them, you know,
put the pieces together. But

583
00:32:02.790 --> 00:32:06.090
I think to me, it
seemed like he had this

584
00:32:06.090 --> 00:32:09.360
idea of his own and
then had people kind of

585
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:12.270
help him put it together.
I just don't know how

586
00:32:12.270 --> 00:32:16.830
he would put together. Like
who's reading all these entries

587
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.830
and emails. And, and so
for me, that's something that

588
00:32:19.830 --> 00:32:21.510
I do for my clients.
Like they have a cool

589
00:32:21.510 --> 00:32:24.990
contest idea. I'm the one
who like pints through all

590
00:32:24.990 --> 00:32:27.720
the entries and then finds
the winner, you know, but

591
00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:30.060
I don't think Paris is
doing that whole process, but

592
00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:33.150
there's someone that definitely helping
him out. It's amazing to

593
00:32:33.150 --> 00:32:34.950
me that somebody with a
couple of million bucks in

594
00:32:34.950 --> 00:32:39.500
the bank probably has a,
like you said, nerd of

595
00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.070
the entourage, right. You know,
he's got like bridges and.com

596
00:32:43.070 --> 00:32:46.970
and he says, hey.com. Let's
put together a contest. That'd

597
00:32:46.970 --> 00:32:49.310
be, that'd be great idea.
You know, you think you

598
00:32:49.320 --> 00:32:52.730
would be much more polished,
but it is pretty sloppy

599
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:55.490
to say, to say the
least, even with top level

600
00:32:55.490 --> 00:32:59.260
stars. Yeah, I think so.
And the other thing is

601
00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:02.170
that it's very experimental and,
you know, to be honest,

602
00:33:02.170 --> 00:33:05.230
I run contests and social
media initiatives with my clients

603
00:33:05.320 --> 00:33:09.040
and I'm learning as I
go along because I can

604
00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:11.860
definitely make the best educated
guess as possible just because

605
00:33:11.860 --> 00:33:15.760
of what, you know, my
training and my experience. But,

606
00:33:15.970 --> 00:33:18.940
you know, I don't run
the same contest every single

607
00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:21.640
time. I definitely don't run
the same type of contest

608
00:33:22.060 --> 00:33:25.600
with the, with different clients.
Or even if I devise

609
00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.960
a true Twitter strategy, I
don't devise the same type

610
00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:32.410
of Twitter strategy across all
clientele because they have different

611
00:33:32.410 --> 00:33:37.420
needs. They have different types
of budgets or they have

612
00:33:37.430 --> 00:33:39.880
different, you know, different goals
or they have different staff

613
00:33:40.660 --> 00:33:43.900
resources. So, you know, you
have to be flexible, but

614
00:33:43.900 --> 00:33:45.910
then you also have to
realize that it's, it's a

615
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.360
learning process as well. And
you know, I did at

616
00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:52.840
least make sure that my
clients know that going in

617
00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:55.300
Well, thanks so much Liz
bur for sitting down and

618
00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:57.310

media and what it means

619
00:33:57.310 --> 00:33:59.590

consultant. I really appreciate your

00:33:59.590 --> 00:34:04.450
