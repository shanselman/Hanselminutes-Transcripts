online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode, Scott
has an off the cuff

7
00:00:44.390 --> 00:00:49.790
conversation with Jeff Atwood. Have
you seen cloudy with a

8
00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.280
chance to be balls? Yeah.
I love that movie. Totally

9
00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:55.070
underrated movie. No one appreciated
their movie. Very good movie.

10
00:00:55.070 --> 00:00:57.410
Love that movie. And it's
funny too, because when Henry

11
00:00:57.410 --> 00:00:59.480
sees the part where he
powers up the thing, he

12
00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.150
goes science dude, his, his
voiceover work was so good

13
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:08.120
in that movie. Yeah. I
know. You know, another movie

14
00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:11.270
that just kicked complete ass
in the same vein was

15
00:01:12.290 --> 00:01:15.320
how to train your dragon.
Oh yeah. I mean that

16
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:20.480
guy's voiceover work was just
on point and thoroughly enjoyable.

17
00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:23.660
Yes, I do. I find
that like, I probably prefer

18
00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:25.790
the wackier movies, like how
to dragon dragons kind of

19
00:01:25.790 --> 00:01:27.650
a serious, but it's good.
Don't get, Oh, it's totally

20
00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:29.470
serious. But I mean, I
hear your point, like the,

21
00:01:29.470 --> 00:01:32.360
the slight chance of meatballs,
like you're watching Kelly with

22
00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.830
a chance to meet 12
and you're like, well, I'm

23
00:01:33.830 --> 00:01:35.990
not really sure what kind
of movie this is, you

24
00:01:35.990 --> 00:01:38.540
know? And then like, okay,
well there's some food. Oh,

25
00:01:38.540 --> 00:01:40.850
shit. Food from the sky.
Okay. This is that kind

26
00:01:40.850 --> 00:01:44.180
of movie. It's totally wacky.
There's a, there's all these

27
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:46.310
little things you don't notice
when you watch 53 times

28
00:01:46.310 --> 00:01:48.110
to like, you know, when
he gets it to rain,

29
00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:51.560
ice cream. Well, there's one
part where it's doing Neapolitan.

30
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:53.750
Like there's chocolate, vanilla, and
strawberry. And there's like the

31
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.210
one kid in the strawberry.
I'm like, I love strawberry.

32
00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.130
And like all the other
kids are in chocolate, vanilla.

33
00:02:00.590 --> 00:02:04.250
Like nobody likes strawberry. It's
on the screen for like

34
00:02:04.250 --> 00:02:07.460
all of five seconds. You
know? I love inside jokes.

35
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.730
I've already seen, I've already
seen Thor twice and I'm

36
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.430
starting to look for, for
stuff like that. I haven't

37
00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:16.160
seen, Oh God, it was
so awesome. It's like Spiderman.

38
00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.440
It's like that feeling when
you first saw the original

39
00:02:18.440 --> 00:02:21.830
Spiderman and you were like,
Holy shit, Marvel is making

40
00:02:21.830 --> 00:02:26.390
good movies. Kind of like
a second tier dude, believe

41
00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:28.970
me on paper. This should
not be a good movie.

42
00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.720
I get that intellectually. I
understand that Thor should not

43
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.430
be a good movie. When
I heard about it. I'm

44
00:02:34.430 --> 00:02:38.330
like really, really Thor. I
mean, Wolverine, w who's next

45
00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:41.960
Falcon, Aqua man is only
a movie on like fucking

46
00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:45.290
entourage as a dramatic conceit.
It's never actually been a

47
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:48.590
movie. I mean, you would
just, you would think of

48
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.340
all credibility. Exactly. Of all
of, all of the ones

49
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:54.980
that they would pick four
would be the last, you

50
00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.670
know, it would be like
black Panther and green fucking

51
00:02:58.730 --> 00:03:02.760
a glance turn. And then
maybe I think they haven't

52
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:05.610
done anything with black Panther.
Haven't they? You should. That'd

53
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.830
be. I watched that. What
about like, we'll put about

54
00:03:07.830 --> 00:03:10.320
Luke cage, like that's what
Nicholas cage took his name

55
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.950
from David. And that there's
so many, I tell ya,

56
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.110
Stanley is going to be
doing this for the rest

57
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.970
of his life. You know
what I mean? He is

58
00:03:17.970 --> 00:03:20.700
just making money, hand over
fist. It's the special effects

59
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.160
that were, that needed to
get to that level before

60
00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:26.340
he could, you know, really
make it happen. But you

61
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:29.280
don't think the original Batman
wasn't, you know, from the

62
00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.110
sixties, wasn't lots of enough
for you. For me, Batman

63
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:35.910
will always be Michael Keaton.
I don't care what anyone

64
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:40.830
says. It'll always be, it'll
always be mr. Mom for

65
00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:42.530
me. And then you get
an old enough, he keeps

66
00:03:42.530 --> 00:03:44.640
seeing them reboot. It. It's
like, Oh, they rebooted Batman.

67
00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:47.520
Another guy. I believe they
have the, they rebooted Hawk

68
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.040
within like an 18 month
period. Yeah. But all the

69
00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:53.940
hooks have sucked. I only
Dang the win was awful,

70
00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:56.790
but the, the, the one
with, I mean, any, anything

71
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:59.640
with Edward Norton is good. I
respect Evernote's and true. That's

72
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.770
true. And Liv, Tyler, we
can't, you know, you can't

73
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:05.250
go against Liv. Tyler. No.
Yeah, that'd be wrong. But

74
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:08.550
yeah. I mean, iron man
and can Ironman was casting

75
00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:10.260
and enjoy iron man. Now
I've got to say that

76
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:12.600
Spiderman. I don't know. It's
so, so inspiring. A lot

77
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.120
of people really liked it.
And also X-Men I thought

78
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.560
the first one was pretty
good. I don't know. I

79
00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:19.500
just, It was great. And
the other two were so

80
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.890
kind of ma that, honestly,
I can't tell them apart

81
00:04:22.890 --> 00:04:25.650
when they're on TV, right?
Like it's almost like Superman

82
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.080
two and three sweater, all
expert and two and three.

83
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.170
It's like, well, which one
is this? You know what

84
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:33.240
I mean? Like it comes
on TV. There's like certain

85
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:35.550
movies that come on TV
that are like my Shawshank,

86
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:37.980
you know? And one of
my Shawshank comes on. That

87
00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:39.840
means it's just like, whatever
movie it is, like golden

88
00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:44.130
child. It's like, Oh shit.
That's must Shawshank. I need

89
00:04:44.130 --> 00:04:45.210
to watch it. You know
what I mean? Like, whatever

90
00:04:45.210 --> 00:04:47.860
you're doing, just because you
happen to go up, up,

91
00:04:47.900 --> 00:04:51.540
up, up, up, and then
you're like, Oh shit, golden

92
00:04:51.540 --> 00:04:54.120
child was on. I've never
actually seen each other. See

93
00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:57.450
any Murphy movie, are you
serious? I haven't seen it.

94
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:01.710
And just that one good
movie that's went back and

95
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:04.230
back with the Murphy. You
know, he liked to party

96
00:05:04.230 --> 00:05:08.610
all the time. That was
seriously. I mean, that's a

97
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.320
great, great movie. I was,
I was all ready to

98
00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:16.050
go off and like do
a bunch of like quotes

99
00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:20.670
from it. And now I'm
uncomfortable that I can't like,

100
00:05:20.730 --> 00:05:24.810
I get like, it's all
like, Oh, that's awful From

101
00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:26.190
with golden tail was like,
I couldn't quite get my

102
00:05:26.190 --> 00:05:27.960
head around. Like, what the
hell is it? Like, even

103
00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.700
as a kid, like, this
was what, 1984. So I'm

104
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:31.500
like 14. I was like,
what is this about? Like,

105
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:34.530
I couldn't, it didn't sell
me on the concept. Like,

106
00:05:34.530 --> 00:05:38.250
okay, there's a golden child.
There's any Murphy. There's what's

107
00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:41.310
happening here. You know? Like
I couldn't quite figure it

108
00:05:41.310 --> 00:05:43.530
out. So I'm all more
than willing to give it

109
00:05:43.530 --> 00:05:45.900
another shot. And you know,
but you know, what we

110
00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:49.650
can, we can talk about
is the last samurai, the,

111
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:53.580
the, the full body glow,
the samurai. You mean the

112
00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:57.560
last avatar? No, no, no,
no. Do you mean Tom

113
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:01.160
cruise? No, no, no, no.
This is with what's your

114
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:07.850
black actors. Oh, wait a
second. Like dynamite, like, okay.

115
00:06:08.290 --> 00:06:10.520
The guy gets the full
body glow, the little, just

116
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:11.990
the hands that look, first
of all, to Kung Fu

117
00:06:11.990 --> 00:06:14.900
movie with black people that
narrows it down considerably. Hopefully

118
00:06:16.070 --> 00:06:19.130
I believe it's called. And
the guy called the Shogun

119
00:06:19.130 --> 00:06:23.510
of Harlem. Shogun of Harlem.
You seen black dynamite just,

120
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:25.370
Oh, I love black. And
you're there making a secret.

121
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:28.550
I'll know the guys on
Twitter and somebody retweeted. And

122
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.670
I actually saw it somehow,
but the main got this

123
00:06:31.730 --> 00:06:35.350
classic man lactide him. It
was brilliant. Everything. Honestly, he's

124
00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:38.290
such an underrated actor, You
know, it's called the last

125
00:06:38.290 --> 00:06:41.080
dragon. It's the 19th. I've
seen that. That's the one.

126
00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.970
Isn't that? The one where
like Kareem Abdul Jabbar shows

127
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:52.360
up. I don't know if
he's in that, but it's

128
00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:54.820
just a classic Katie's movie.
I mean, if, if the

129
00:06:54.820 --> 00:06:56.500
golden child is anywhere near
as good as that, then

130
00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:01.630
you've sold me. The golden
child is just so incredible.

131
00:07:02.680 --> 00:07:06.400
Wait, wait, is it more
quotable than coming to America?

132
00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:10.780
It is equally as quotable.
Okay. The initial quote that

133
00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:12.040
I was going to quote
where I can't even tell

134
00:07:12.040 --> 00:07:14.410
you, because just watch it,
just watch it. It's fun.

135
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:17.230
I think it's on Netflix
instance. It's it's worth it.

136
00:07:17.230 --> 00:07:19.570
There's a couple of, there's
a hot chicken. It of

137
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:27.010
indefinite ethnicity. It's a Seriously.
This is Eddie Murphy is

138
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:28.390
one of those people. Let
me see if I can

139
00:07:28.390 --> 00:07:30.460
find her name. He's one
of these people where he'll

140
00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:33.460
have this girl in the
movie that you've never seen

141
00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:37.150
before. And you'll think to
yourself, there's never been a

142
00:07:37.150 --> 00:07:40.330
hotter chick. She's big things
are happening for this girl.

143
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.470
And then you never see
them again. Right. You know

144
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.110
what I'm saying? That happens
sometimes. Yeah. I mean, he,

145
00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:50.080
he had this girl in
this movie and I don't

146
00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:52.750
think, I think at the
time when like 1986 or

147
00:07:52.750 --> 00:07:54.880
whenever this came out, I
thought to myself, there are

148
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:57.730
no prettier people than this
particular chick, like the curly

149
00:07:57.730 --> 00:08:01.510
hair chick on a, a
goal of coming to America.

150
00:08:01.510 --> 00:08:02.920
You know, everyone thought she
was hot at the time,

151
00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:08.150
but then you never hear
from her again. Right. And,

152
00:08:08.150 --> 00:08:10.840
and then, so he basically
kills their careers as he

153
00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:15.970
boots their career. Yeah, here
she is. Here she is.

154
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:18.310
I'm going to check it
out. Oh yeah. This is

155
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.710
the girl. You know, there
was somebody like that. I

156
00:08:20.710 --> 00:08:22.060
looked at recently, she had
died and then I felt

157
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:25.030
really bad. Yeah. Yeah. I
always feel bad about that.

158
00:08:25.030 --> 00:08:27.040
Like, you're looking for hot
chicks and you're like, Oh,

159
00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:29.530
she was really hot and
she's hot and dead. That's

160
00:08:29.530 --> 00:08:31.840
like kind of disrespectful. It's
like, cause you were hot

161
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:38.650
and now you're picking up
Eddie Murphy. Cause other than,

162
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:41.110
you know, Shrek movies, it's
like this kind of curious

163
00:08:41.110 --> 00:08:43.620
would have been doing, but
not a lot. Yeah. It's

164
00:08:43.670 --> 00:08:48.820
unfortunately with big yoga chick,
interesting. Find a good picture.

165
00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:51.520
And also that hat, you
know, Eddie Murphy, the Hattie

166
00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:53.350
wore in that movie didn't
work for me. That totally

167
00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:55.650
does not work for me.
That the hat is like

168
00:08:55.650 --> 00:08:57.860
holding It back. It did
hold me back a little

169
00:08:57.860 --> 00:09:01.670
bit. Didn't like the hat.
That's sad. I know. To

170
00:09:01.670 --> 00:09:03.290
write off, to write out
for a movie because of

171
00:09:03.290 --> 00:09:06.710
the hat. Here we go.
Here's another one. Check this,

172
00:09:06.710 --> 00:09:09.830
check out. This is her.
Oh yeah. She's wait. She's

173
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:13.520
been, these are some, Hey
DJ. Some of movie. Well,

174
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.770
these are, you know, she
never, never, no nothing ever

175
00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:22.490
happened for her. Hey DJ.
That's the wow. Truly indefinitely

176
00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:25.580
Indian, You know? And she's
from England. Of course. Right.

177
00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:30.170
Well, yeah. It kind of
equates to Indian India stuff

178
00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.340
they did From, I say
India. I mean UK. Yeah.

179
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:35.990
No, no, but I mean,
Oh I guess it does.

180
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.270
Yeah. Well, it's been really
connected. They were part of

181
00:09:38.270 --> 00:09:39.620
the British and that's a
good point. That's a good

182
00:09:39.620 --> 00:09:41.900
point. I mean, I blame
them for the influx of

183
00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.080
just hideous Indian programming questions
to with stack overflow. It's

184
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.670
like, why did you teach
them English? Why did you

185
00:09:46.670 --> 00:09:50.060
have to do that? Totally
blame the British empire for

186
00:09:50.060 --> 00:09:54.620
them. We should, we should
plan them. They're believable. Don't

187
00:09:54.620 --> 00:09:58.580
put it in. Don't don't
put that people are quoting

188
00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.920
people. I just meant I
tweeted this and he says,

189
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.020
so it's coding horror. So
you've gotten through life that

190
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:09.380
a single chunky ass as
reference. So you're not going

191
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:12.980
to get any of these
things. Yeah. My brother Nancy.

192
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:18.650
Oh God, I am just
falling over. That is classic.

193
00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:24.350
You know, I wrote about
SSDs failing and then Sam,

194
00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:26.270
you know, our program where
we'll show that you already

195
00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.510
know Robert, you talked to
him, he had a raid,

196
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.140
zero array, mirrored array of,
of, of SSDs when they

197
00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:36.020
just failed. Well, one of
them is from a failed

198
00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:39.800
Dude. After I, after that
whole discussion of SSTs failing

199
00:10:39.830 --> 00:10:41.930
came out on Twitter a
couple of days ago I

200
00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.580
had just updated. I don't
know if you'd heard or

201
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.690
not, but I bought a
sin. Synology NAS. Oh yeah.

202
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.340
Yeah. I linked it in
the show notes, dude. I

203
00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:51.110
actually found them. Oh you
did? Okay. So yeah, so

204
00:10:51.110 --> 00:10:53.540
I bought that one and
I put in eight gigs

205
00:10:53.570 --> 00:10:56.780
and dude I'm I am
just kidding. I probably spent

206
00:10:56.780 --> 00:10:59.180
20 minutes backing shit up
every night, every day now.

207
00:10:59.210 --> 00:11:00.740
Cause I'm so paranoid that
these things are going to

208
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.590
die. Like every time my
computer pauses for more than

209
00:11:03.590 --> 00:11:05.420
three seconds, I'm like, Oh,
here it goes here. Oh,

210
00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.260
Nope. Not yet. It is
that, that sudden though. That's

211
00:11:09.260 --> 00:11:14.000
what really shocked. Cause I
I've been dicking around computers

212
00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:15.500
for a long time. Right?
Like I basically am building

213
00:11:15.500 --> 00:11:18.950
my own computer since 1995,
upgraded at least 20 or

214
00:11:18.950 --> 00:11:22.070
30 hard drives just by
the new fastest thing forever.

215
00:11:22.460 --> 00:11:25.610
I have never seen drives,
fail. Physical drives, fail. I

216
00:11:25.610 --> 00:11:27.590
mean, granted, you get lucky,
you get unlucky. I've had

217
00:11:27.590 --> 00:11:29.300
a couple of drivers go
click, click, click. And then

218
00:11:29.300 --> 00:11:31.130
I just swapped them out
before they would never actually

219
00:11:31.130 --> 00:11:33.620
happen. Die. Right. Right. This
is just like you, you

220
00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:36.080
literally wake up one day
and just you're gone. It's

221
00:11:36.080 --> 00:11:38.750
just, there's no warning. There's
no, I was on a

222
00:11:38.750 --> 00:11:41.270
live meeting. I was having
a conversation. It was like

223
00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.250
deep, deep into multitasking doing
everything. That's wonderful about SSTs

224
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.670
And then the mouse that's
the right one. The mouse

225
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.100
kept moving and nothing else
did. And then I was

226
00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:54.280
like, Oh, and then the
screen went black. I didn't

227
00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:55.840
even get the, I didn't
even get the respect of

228
00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:00.360
a blue screen. Wow. That's
it. That's it. Yeah. Cool.

229
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.780
Awesome. Love that level. Cause
based on the price you

230
00:12:03.780 --> 00:12:08.130
said spending that's the one,
right? No, no, it looked

231
00:12:08.130 --> 00:12:09.810
really nice, but no I
did. I linked that from

232
00:12:09.810 --> 00:12:12.630
the show notes so magical.
I did the research. I

233
00:12:12.630 --> 00:12:16.170
didn't, you know, I don't
skimp on notes producer. Alex

234
00:12:16.170 --> 00:12:18.060
does some of the show
notes, but he's, he, he

235
00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:20.190
doesn't get okay job, but
he's not like super geeky

236
00:12:20.190 --> 00:12:21.870
like us. So it's hard
for him. Is he like

237
00:12:21.870 --> 00:12:25.290
a Salesmen who does producing
on the side? Nursing? Just

238
00:12:25.290 --> 00:12:27.660
like, I don't know because
Joel always wanted like a

239
00:12:27.660 --> 00:12:30.420
sidekick, like someone just to
help with, there's just a

240
00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:32.190
ton of miscellaneous stuff that
needs to be get done.

241
00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:35.490
He's like his assistant kind
of. Yeah. But you know,

242
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:37.470
a techies technical to the
extent that, I mean he's

243
00:12:37.470 --> 00:12:39.810
able to get most of
it done, but when it

244
00:12:39.810 --> 00:12:41.970
comes to show notes, I'm
really anal. Okay. They have

245
00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:46.470
to be just right. Oh
really? Like every little thing

246
00:12:46.470 --> 00:12:48.120
we talked about, you know,
like I want people, I

247
00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:51.540
don't know, you know, every
of substance. Yeah, yeah, no,

248
00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:53.550
I understand. I should have
a producer to do that.

249
00:12:53.550 --> 00:12:56.520
Cause I'm always getting people
complaining that I, I always

250
00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:58.950
say in the middle of
the talk. Oh yeah. And

251
00:12:58.950 --> 00:13:00.600
I'll put that in the
show notes. I never do.

252
00:13:02.070 --> 00:13:04.470
Yeah. But I get like,
this is also my concession

253
00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:06.570
to people who don't have
time to listen to podcasts.

254
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.870
You can actually read the
notes and get 50% of

255
00:13:09.870 --> 00:13:11.550
it. You know, you can
get just the meat of

256
00:13:11.550 --> 00:13:13.980
like, here's the links. Here's
the basic concepts of what

257
00:13:13.980 --> 00:13:15.810
we talked about. You can
read more here, you know

258
00:13:15.810 --> 00:13:19.410
what I mean? Otherwise, the
kind of blog posts kind

259
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.720
of pointless, like here's podcast
click. It's like, well that's

260
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:30.450
useless. Let's just assign post
to audio. Right? How it's

261
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.460
it's very labor intensive though.
I mean, that's one of

262
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:34.800
the reasons Joel kind of
stopped doing the podcast was,

263
00:13:35.790 --> 00:13:37.380
you know, he had to
do all the editing such

264
00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:40.500
as it is and upload
the file. And it was

265
00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.730
a lot of work. So
I'm, I'm happy to have

266
00:13:41.730 --> 00:13:44.290
producer relics help. But I
do like the show with

267
00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:45.840
some certain way. And, and
part of that, the reason

268
00:13:45.850 --> 00:13:47.270
I brought it up was
that when you talked about

269
00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:49.320
the thing, I wouldn't leave
exactly that thing right. In

270
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:53.040
the show notes because it
was cool. Right? Yeah. That's

271
00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:56.850
all People, dude. I'm getting
an influx of people talking

272
00:13:56.850 --> 00:14:00.240
about like giving quotes to
this show and they're sad

273
00:14:00.240 --> 00:14:04.830
because It was like six,
six different quotes in the

274
00:14:04.830 --> 00:14:07.530
last couple of minutes here.
He doesn't know this one.

275
00:14:08.460 --> 00:14:12.630
Oh, that's so classic. I
did get one slightly cool

276
00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:14.850
geek out. You know, Logitech
sells those keyboards that have

277
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:17.880
the LCDs on them that
are programmable. Yeah. You seen

278
00:14:17.880 --> 00:14:19.920
those. And they also have
like a, like a keypad,

279
00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.750
like it's for gamers or
whatever, but it's just like

280
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.900
a little new kind of
a numeric keypad for gamers

281
00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:27.540
with like a, Oh yeah.
A little it's w a

282
00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:30.600
S D All that stuff.
So I it's a long

283
00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:32.250
story. I won't bore you
the whole details, but I've

284
00:14:32.250 --> 00:14:33.600
been playing with it just,
it was just a for

285
00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.830
fun thing. It was, I'll
just get this to play

286
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:36.420
with it and see what
it's worth. And I gotta

287
00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:39.120
tell this LCDs like awesome.
Like there's Lindsey really good

288
00:14:39.120 --> 00:14:41.820
plugins. Like there's one that
gives you frame rate in

289
00:14:41.820 --> 00:14:43.800
your games, like for automat,
like give me the link.

290
00:14:44.670 --> 00:14:47.970
Well, it's the Logitech <inaudible>
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, Yeah.

291
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:49.380
I know. Remember that. There's
a bunch of people who

292
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:52.640
are like, obsessed with that.
Yeah. It's really Neat. And

293
00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.470
if you think about, it's
kind of dumb because there's

294
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:56.570
nothing the LCD does that
you couldn't like have another,

295
00:14:57.140 --> 00:15:00.500
you know, that Lilliput USB
monitor, right? It's like, you

296
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.000
can do the same fucking
shit with that. Or just

297
00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.760
like a regular monitor. Right?
Like have a whole monitor

298
00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.580
It's dude. I looked at
my iPad today. Literally today

299
00:15:06.580 --> 00:15:09.280
I hooked up my iPad
with display link and I'm

300
00:15:09.280 --> 00:15:12.400
like, okay. So it's a
tiny monitor, you know? And

301
00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:14.920
I also have, what's called
a MIMO, which is a

302
00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:17.950
little USB monitor and it's
like, what's how do you

303
00:15:17.950 --> 00:15:22.840
spell that? M I M
O Am I okay. Monitors.com

304
00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.110
here. Okay. Okay. Oh, nice.
So it's like, this is

305
00:15:26.110 --> 00:15:27.730
good. I was looking for
this. Yeah. So I have

306
00:15:27.730 --> 00:15:29.020
one of these. I give
you two, if you want

307
00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.820
it. It's garbage. I heard
a little of the Lilliput

308
00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.270
a little just by thinking
it gets 99 bucks, which

309
00:15:37.270 --> 00:15:39.580
is actually a good deal.
It's hard to small displays.

310
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:42.700
I don't think they make
them a capacity anymore. They're

311
00:15:42.700 --> 00:15:50.470
not. Yeah. Put do dude.
Lilla put USB Here. Here

312
00:15:50.470 --> 00:15:54.760
it is. I don't know
how to spell it. Okay.

313
00:15:56.380 --> 00:15:57.970
Well think about it. The
thing that's slightly cool about

314
00:15:57.970 --> 00:15:59.950
it. It's fully USB. I
mean, granted, that means it

315
00:15:59.950 --> 00:16:02.710
doesn't have. Okay. So the
Put USB monitor in the

316
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:05.620
MIMO are the same thing.
Probably they are literally they

317
00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:08.110
have no touching. No, no,
no. This one doesn't have

318
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:10.030
touching. It's a little bit
cheaper. I bought mine for

319
00:16:10.030 --> 00:16:15.250
79 bucks back before, like
these things got popular and

320
00:16:16.090 --> 00:16:19.690
it's, it's like 1,024 by
600 or some weird resolution

321
00:16:19.690 --> 00:16:21.730
like that. Yeah. So I
would, don't even think about

322
00:16:21.730 --> 00:16:24.190
it. The problem is I
have a 30 in front

323
00:16:24.190 --> 00:16:26.080
of me and I got
a 24 of my left

324
00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.110
on 24. My right, right.
There's literally like nowhere else

325
00:16:29.110 --> 00:16:32.230
reasonable to put this thing.
I know. Well, that's what

326
00:16:32.230 --> 00:16:34.330
I'm struggling with. So it's
like, well, what do, I

327
00:16:34.330 --> 00:16:36.250
mean, I just want more
pixels. Right? I want more

328
00:16:36.250 --> 00:16:38.470
pixels in my face because
any, anything that I'm looking

329
00:16:38.470 --> 00:16:41.800
at, like my wall or
art is not moving things

330
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:44.830
forward because it's not pixels.
And if it's not pixels,

331
00:16:44.830 --> 00:16:49.000
it's not working for me,
Edward Tufty. Right. So I

332
00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:50.770
put my iPad, looking at
my iPad right now and

333
00:16:50.770 --> 00:16:52.210
I have display link on
it. Like, well, maybe I'll

334
00:16:52.210 --> 00:16:55.290
put my to do list
there. Well, that's why the

335
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.220
LCD on the keyboard is
not as crazy. It says,

336
00:16:57.220 --> 00:16:59.140
it sounds, you know what
I mean? Because it's like

337
00:16:59.140 --> 00:17:01.570
a little accessory. See, I
liked the idea of a,

338
00:17:01.690 --> 00:17:04.300
of a, of an LCD,
like a chronic, like remember

339
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:07.690
the old crystal, crystal tech
LCDs that used to put

340
00:17:07.690 --> 00:17:10.540
in the five and a
half inch floppy drive. You

341
00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.760
remember this? So back when
five and a half inch

342
00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:16.210
floppies, when went away, we
have all these bays in

343
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:18.490
the front of our computers.
So all of these people

344
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.000
would go and put buttons
and led displays stuff like

345
00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.450
crystals and crystal works or
crystal texts. So people would

346
00:17:25.450 --> 00:17:28.750
go off and do that.
And they would then put

347
00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:32.020
the stage, you know, the
speed of their fan and

348
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:35.440
their temperature and that kind
of stuff. Right. Which is

349
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.140
all interesting. But you know,
of marginal value. It seemed

350
00:17:41.140 --> 00:17:45.070
like a good idea at
the time, but I don't

351
00:17:45.070 --> 00:17:48.430
know. Yeah. Well, I mean,
you're not looking at the

352
00:17:48.430 --> 00:17:50.970
front of your PC. That's
really the problem. Yeah. So

353
00:17:50.970 --> 00:17:52.110
I don't know what I'm
gonna try now is I'm

354
00:17:52.110 --> 00:17:54.810
gonna try using the iPad
to put one note on

355
00:17:54.810 --> 00:17:57.840
it and just have my
cause. It's cause the one

356
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.020
note represents my, my day,
my day stuff, you know?

357
00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.070
Yeah. I'm struggling with that
too, because I have three

358
00:18:07.130 --> 00:18:09.470
27 inch water. Yeah. It's
effectively the same thing. So

359
00:18:09.470 --> 00:18:10.940
it's like, why do I,
why, why did you want

360
00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:13.490
this? She just wanted to
see what I mostly just

361
00:18:13.490 --> 00:18:16.880
wanna play with it. But
it turns out like when

362
00:18:16.880 --> 00:18:20.750
I'm gaming, when it's like
actually full screen, I don't

363
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:22.520
know that there's something to
this because I really do

364
00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:26.090
like a, you know, resource
monitor, which has the most

365
00:18:26.090 --> 00:18:28.520
generic name ever of any
thing that has ever been

366
00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.880
created. And this monitors, your
resources, what the fuck does

367
00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:34.010
that mean? Cause I always
like, forget it and you

368
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:36.320
know, I know performance monitor.
Yeah, No, I used to

369
00:18:36.320 --> 00:18:38.690
have all that stuff. I've
got like the windows seven

370
00:18:38.690 --> 00:18:40.790
network meter. That's the thing
I'm always upset with. It's

371
00:18:40.790 --> 00:18:44.840
like, bam, Well, this can
be pretty brutal for us

372
00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:47.870
too. Like I was just
the stack overflow databases. So

373
00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:51.430
stupidly large. It's just painful.
So I actually put it

374
00:18:51.430 --> 00:18:53.870
in my, I upgraded the
SSD to the, for three,

375
00:18:53.870 --> 00:18:57.710
which is awesome. Highly recommended.
No, they'll fail. Yeah. It's

376
00:18:57.710 --> 00:18:59.510
still awesome. I always assume
they'll fail in a year.

377
00:19:00.230 --> 00:19:03.110
Yeah. Cause it cost $600.
It's $2 a day. Just

378
00:19:03.110 --> 00:19:05.360
drink, you know, drink one
less soda pop. And then

379
00:19:05.360 --> 00:19:07.790
I get the joy of
SST all day long. I

380
00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:10.460
know. So I took my
oldest SD, which is like,

381
00:19:10.490 --> 00:19:12.290
I don't even feel comfortable
selling this to anyone. It's

382
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:14.090
like, this is a used
SST. This is like a

383
00:19:14.090 --> 00:19:16.340
time bomb. Like this is
like selling someone, a loaded

384
00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:18.500
gun. I was like, I'm
just going to throw it

385
00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:19.730
away. But rather than throw
it away, I was like,

386
00:19:19.730 --> 00:19:21.920
I'm gonna use it as
my sketch drive to put

387
00:19:21.920 --> 00:19:23.750
this deck overflow database on.
So I get some actually

388
00:19:23.750 --> 00:19:27.200
decent performance. Nice. Just loading
that thing in is just

389
00:19:27.230 --> 00:19:29.460
a pretty brutal it's like,
I think it's got a

390
00:19:29.470 --> 00:19:31.400
hundred and we need to
compact it, but it's like

391
00:19:31.400 --> 00:19:36.050
150 gig now or something
just retardedly large. So that's

392
00:19:36.050 --> 00:19:38.210
one of the things that
we we'd like to develop

393
00:19:38.210 --> 00:19:40.790
locally. But sometimes we actually
do want to test against

394
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.730
stack overflow data. So having
an SST is like essential.

395
00:19:43.730 --> 00:19:45.860
Now it's like, you didn't
even attempt the deal with

396
00:19:45.870 --> 00:19:48.140
stack overflow database and you
unicity. Cause it's just, it's

397
00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:50.150
like, literally you want to
crane, it'd be like 15,

398
00:19:50.150 --> 00:19:53.750
just go to lunch really.
You know, and some of

399
00:19:53.750 --> 00:19:55.760
it fits in memory, you
know, some of the indexes

400
00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:58.400
and stuff, like all our
machines have 24 gigs on

401
00:19:58.520 --> 00:20:03.590
the main team, but it's
Growing faster than, than hardware

402
00:20:03.590 --> 00:20:06.680
is getting faster. Sure. We
think our ACE ACE in

403
00:20:06.680 --> 00:20:08.780
the hole is, is that
SSDs are getting so much

404
00:20:08.780 --> 00:20:11.570
better. So by the time
we sort of run out

405
00:20:11.570 --> 00:20:15.290
of memory space right now,
the database server, the primary

406
00:20:15.290 --> 00:20:19.190
data, Mister has 96 gigs,
which is, you know, not

407
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:22.700
stupidly, it's just expensive, not
stupidly expensive. There's always stupid

408
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:24.380
expensive. You know, if you
really want to go crazy.

409
00:20:24.380 --> 00:20:27.380
Yeah. We never really want
to go there. But we

410
00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:30.050
think by the time we
can't like memory, can't keep

411
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:31.850
up with us. Like, you
know, it's too, we'd have

412
00:20:31.850 --> 00:20:35.780
to upgrade to 256 gig
or something. Insane. SSDs are

413
00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:37.880
going to be so good.
And so in large enough

414
00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:40.190
that they can actually support
us and particularly a raid

415
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:43.460
array. Like if you look
at the Vertex three and

416
00:20:43.550 --> 00:20:46.400
versus the Vertex two and
over the original Vertex, like

417
00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:50.290
they've literally performance really in
the last two years. Yeah.

418
00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:54.460
And they're all indication is
that's probably gonna continue for

419
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:59.550
a while. Hi, this is
Scott coming to you from

420
00:20:59.550 --> 00:21:02.790
another place in time. Are
you using agile practices to

421
00:21:02.790 --> 00:21:04.980
manage your software development? There's
lots of tools in the

422
00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:07.290
market that manage the steps
of a project, but most

423
00:21:07.290 --> 00:21:10.230
of them focus on individual
roles. Get ready for a

424
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.600
solution that caters for the
success of the whole team.

425
00:21:12.750 --> 00:21:16.500
Guys at Tellerik introduced team
pulse. It's an agile project

426
00:21:16.500 --> 00:21:20.070
management tool. That'll help you
gather ideas, estimate plan, track

427
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:23.970
progress in a common workspace.
Finally companies, regardless of their

428
00:21:23.970 --> 00:21:26.130
size can use a lightweight
and convenient tool that makes

429
00:21:26.130 --> 00:21:29.550
all the stakeholders work as
a United team. Even if

430
00:21:29.550 --> 00:21:32.940
they're in different countries by
combining intuitive user interface and

431
00:21:32.940 --> 00:21:35.730
the power server light team
poles removes the roadblocks that

432
00:21:35.730 --> 00:21:38.370
you typically face and applying
agile in an effective manner,

433
00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.180
no more lost data, no
disparate systems, no lack of

434
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:46.050
critical analytics regarding the health
and philosophy project. See if

We do appreciate There wouldn't

439
00:22:04.980 --> 00:22:06.960
be a Hansel minutes if
there wasn't, Tellerik helping us.

440
00:22:08.010 --> 00:22:10.510
So we're basically running on
ramdisks at this point, we

441
00:22:10.530 --> 00:22:12.450
can call them SSTs or
flash or whatever, but they

442
00:22:12.450 --> 00:22:15.030
are, I mean, there's a
bunch of bandwidth considerations cause

443
00:22:15.030 --> 00:22:17.640
set a set of two
and set a three set.

444
00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:19.620
A three is set at
two is already the bottleneck

445
00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:21.990
for newer SSDs. Well, yeah,
I've got a, What do

446
00:22:21.990 --> 00:22:23.400
I have in this one?
I have a crucial see

447
00:22:23.400 --> 00:22:26.790
300. And when I run
it at a, on this,

448
00:22:26.790 --> 00:22:29.370
my main machine, the one
that I call the ultimate

449
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:33.420
coding, horror, ultimate developer machine
part two, I get 7.8.

450
00:22:33.450 --> 00:22:35.100
So I have like all
seven nines and a seven,

451
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.590
eight on the drive. But
when I have it, that's

452
00:22:37.620 --> 00:22:38.970
what I have to let
me see. Yeah. But when

453
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:41.940
I have it plugged in
to the sat, a three,

454
00:22:43.650 --> 00:22:45.720
Ah, see, now look at
this, I'm down to 7.7

455
00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:49.860
because my SSD is starting
to just kind of, Yeah.

456
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.690
I have 7.8 on my
disc as well. I think

457
00:22:51.690 --> 00:22:57.240
you're just limited. We're literally
limited by the interface. I

458
00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:59.610
got the six gigabit, you
know, thing, you need like

459
00:22:59.610 --> 00:23:03.960
a special Cable and everything,
but I found it to

460
00:23:03.960 --> 00:23:07.200
be unreliable like, like, Oh
yeah, no, it's gotta be

461
00:23:07.200 --> 00:23:09.390
native. Like you need this
new bridge. No, no. Yeah.

462
00:23:09.390 --> 00:23:11.550
It's not the thing is
I made the mistake of

463
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:15.810
Putting together this coding horror
PC, literally like two months

464
00:23:16.140 --> 00:23:19.740
before Sandy bridge Kelly like
hit it. So the sad

465
00:23:19.740 --> 00:23:21.300
part is I put all
this money into this machine

466
00:23:21.300 --> 00:23:24.690
and it probably would be
30% faster if I had

467
00:23:24.690 --> 00:23:28.110
just waited a few months.
Yeah. Sandy bridge is nice.

468
00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:31.110
Well, you got to wait
the, the, the true high

469
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:34.530
end stuff isn't coming out
until like fourth quarter of

470
00:23:34.530 --> 00:23:37.170
this year. And there'll be,
there'll be quad channel. Oh.

471
00:23:37.170 --> 00:23:39.990
So that'll be nice. Cause
I don't wanna, I don't

472
00:23:39.990 --> 00:23:43.170
like, like I bought that
This fancy motherboard that has

473
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.340
all this like Intel, Intel
chip sets, weren't ready. So

474
00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.870
we did it ourselves, you
know? And it's just like,

475
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:49.580
you know, I don't want
to install some random guy.

476
00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:55.150
Is you a USB three
driver? No, just I want

477
00:23:55.150 --> 00:23:59.500
to wait until it's native
and it's built in. Yes,

478
00:23:59.530 --> 00:24:01.540
no, totally. That's the correct
way to look at it.

479
00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:04.300
Unfortunately, you know, the really
Sandy bridge is so good.

480
00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:06.570
It makes the high end
stuff. It's basically equal to

481
00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:08.110
all the high end stuff.
Like if you bought a

482
00:24:08.110 --> 00:24:11.320
really high end core, <inaudible>
like the six core, whatever

483
00:24:11.850 --> 00:24:15.940
the like three or $400
Sandy bridge will easily equal

484
00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:18.820
that. Right? Oh yeah. Without
a doubt, but it's not

485
00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:20.980
going to do better. So
if you want to do

486
00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.490
better for the super high
end stuff for another six

487
00:24:24.490 --> 00:24:27.520
months, wait, but quad channel,
which, which is exciting because

488
00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:30.310
that means if there's eight
memory slots, you know, do

489
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:33.220
the math, it's like eight
times four. That's 30 to

490
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:37.440
get. Right. So what is
your, what is your What's

491
00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:44.620
what's your WEEI now? It
is, I think I'm some

492
00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:48.550
0.3. I'm limited by CPU
or yeah, no, seven three.

493
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:53.380
What the hell? It's it's
live video limited. Surprisingly, I

494
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:59.950
have the, the 57 90.
Oh dude. So it would

495
00:24:59.950 --> 00:25:03.340
be 7.5. We limited by
video and then CPU, then

496
00:25:03.490 --> 00:25:06.460
memory than this, Check this
out, speaking. I'm actually right

497
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.800
now I'm on all seven
nines and a seven seven.

498
00:25:10.970 --> 00:25:12.520
And that's the weird part
though. The part that I

499
00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.190
can't trust is every once
in a while, I'll be

500
00:25:15.190 --> 00:25:19.030
all seven, eight, seven, seven,
seven. So WEEI, when you're,

501
00:25:19.030 --> 00:25:21.880
when you're up On the,
on the edge, who knows,

502
00:25:21.880 --> 00:25:23.770
you know what I mean?
It's all food and magic,

503
00:25:24.670 --> 00:25:27.370
right. But here's a, here's
a funny story. So I

504
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:32.170
went and I bought a
<inaudible> GTX 47, a four

505
00:25:32.170 --> 00:25:37.840
70 rather. So Nvidia GTX
four 70, which at the

506
00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.130
time was like the, the
Nvidia card. That was the

507
00:25:42.130 --> 00:25:46.390
best price performance. Right. And,
but, but, but people warn

508
00:25:46.400 --> 00:25:49.690
me about the heat, You
know, blah, blah, blah, the

509
00:25:49.690 --> 00:25:54.850
heat. I don't really care.
So I, I just, whatever,

510
00:25:54.940 --> 00:25:58.720
I don't do the heat.
I don't care. Well, you

511
00:25:58.780 --> 00:26:02.500
should care about No, I
know. So, so, so it

512
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:06.610
turns out, so it turns
out in fact that If

513
00:26:06.610 --> 00:26:09.640
you have a, And in
this monitor, this will do

514
00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:13.370
to this device, We'll do
two 30 inches. So it's,

515
00:26:13.380 --> 00:26:18.880
it's dual DVI Both. So
I could run two thirties

516
00:26:18.880 --> 00:26:21.730
on this thing, but if
you're running two monitors of

517
00:26:21.730 --> 00:26:24.910
different sizes, that means that
like somehow some clock rate

518
00:26:24.910 --> 00:26:26.950
is different. So if the
clock rate is different between

519
00:26:26.950 --> 00:26:30.850
the two monitors you plug
in, then there's a bug

520
00:26:31.070 --> 00:26:35.650
The thing and it doubles
the heat really. Like this

521
00:26:35.650 --> 00:26:37.960
is like a known as
a hard word. Yeah. And

522
00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:40.210
so it was all over
a non-tech it's like a

523
00:26:40.210 --> 00:26:44.100
known. Understood. Thanks. Well, there's
a reason, like if you

524
00:26:44.100 --> 00:26:46.140
read video card reviews, just
go to some hardware site

525
00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.790
and read the video card
reviews and just look at

526
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.250
the size of the freaking
coolers that they put on

527
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.850
those cards. They are freaking
ginormous for a reason because

528
00:26:53.850 --> 00:26:58.770
these things are generating like
150 times at the very

529
00:26:58.770 --> 00:27:02.610
high end. That's a scary,
scary amount of heat. And

530
00:27:02.610 --> 00:27:04.050
that's just the nature of
the beast at the high

531
00:27:04.050 --> 00:27:07.200
end. If you buy the
sort of the, the new,

532
00:27:07.560 --> 00:27:10.230
you know, consumer grade cards,
they're much more frugal and

533
00:27:10.230 --> 00:27:12.150
they don't burn that much
wattage. But if you want

534
00:27:12.150 --> 00:27:14.820
to be on the bleeding
edge of like maximum performance,

535
00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:18.270
that's just the status quo.
Well, I mean, I know

536
00:27:18.270 --> 00:27:19.910
that It was stupid of
me because I'm never going

537
00:27:19.910 --> 00:27:22.460
to go and play crisis
two on this machine. But

538
00:27:22.660 --> 00:27:25.100
the reason that I went
like that to buy the

539
00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.520
big $400 card was that
I had been running the

540
00:27:28.520 --> 00:27:32.990
30 inch on a budget
card. And I just had

541
00:27:32.990 --> 00:27:36.620
a sense as I would
like minimize stuff or move

542
00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:39.860
windows around that I was,
I was, I was losing

543
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.130
frames and it sounds like
it sounds very selfish and

544
00:27:43.130 --> 00:27:45.140
very much like this is
such a first world problem.

545
00:27:45.170 --> 00:27:47.060
You know what I mean?
Like what do they call

546
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:50.480
that a white wine that
my video card is dropping

547
00:27:50.480 --> 00:27:55.250
two frames every few seconds,
but it was irritating. It

548
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:56.780
was like, it's one of
those things that once you've

549
00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.890
seen it, you couldn't unsee
it. And I just pissed

550
00:28:00.890 --> 00:28:02.780
me off and it was
worth spending an extra hundred

551
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.940
bucks and another four degrees
Celsius to, to fix it

552
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.040
because man, I don't not
even think about this video

553
00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.270
card. It, everything it does.
It does fast. Interestingly, the

554
00:28:14.270 --> 00:28:17.600
bad stuff happens as you
move between two video cards,

555
00:28:17.630 --> 00:28:20.300
right? Like if you're playing
like some high Def video

556
00:28:20.300 --> 00:28:22.760
and then you move it
between two video cards, right.

557
00:28:23.030 --> 00:28:25.640
That's just everything falls apart
at that point. Well, that's

558
00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.800
why That's one reason. I
like the ATI stuff, even

559
00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.570
though it is a little
faster, it's like a game

560
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:31.730
of chase. Sometimes one's a
heads and the other is

561
00:28:31.730 --> 00:28:34.610
mine, but you do get
three displays on a single

562
00:28:34.610 --> 00:28:37.220
card. So like I have
no issues with three monitors

563
00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:39.530
that I have dragging, you
know, fully high Def video

564
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:44.240
from monitor to monitor. Exactly.
I kind of wish Nvidia

565
00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:47.390
would adopt this three monitors
per card thing. But for

566
00:28:47.390 --> 00:28:50.740
some reason they haven't done
that. I think there's a,

567
00:28:50.910 --> 00:28:53.420
I thought that Pete Brown
bought a, a four monitor

568
00:28:53.420 --> 00:28:58.790
card recently You can get
more obscure cards that actually

569
00:28:58.790 --> 00:29:00.800
support a lot of displays,
but they tend to be

570
00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.150
like really expensive, like CAD
cam type stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

571
00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:06.920
The only ones that I
know of that are really

572
00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:09.230
mainstream is just the HCI
stuff. Cause they support three.

573
00:29:09.290 --> 00:29:12.590
What they call affinity. It's
also cool because for gaming,

574
00:29:13.370 --> 00:29:16.100
since it is one card,
you can have a full

575
00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:19.010
size video frame across all
three monitors like it. Yeah.

576
00:29:19.010 --> 00:29:21.860
See, that would be nice.
But see sometimes like I've

577
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.890
bought cards like that before,
like not real affinity, but

578
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:27.620
like right before they started
doing that and it ends

579
00:29:27.620 --> 00:29:31.940
up being like two DVRs
and an HTMI, you know,

580
00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:33.680
where they, where they kind
of wimp out on that

581
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:39.320
third on that third connector.
Yeah. I mean I'm running

582
00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:43.870
three 27, so they're not,
you know, 25, whatever, what

583
00:29:43.870 --> 00:29:47.110
is it? 30 inch, one
or 25 60 bucks number.

584
00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:50.950
I love my 30. Oh
my goodness. It's 25. 60

585
00:29:50.950 --> 00:29:55.000
by 1600. Yeah. This isn't
quite that high risk. So

586
00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:56.650
I don't know if it
wouldn't, you'd have to obviously

587
00:29:56.650 --> 00:29:59.550
do some research to figure
that out. But yeah, I

588
00:30:00.470 --> 00:30:02.410
got a lot of first
world problems, you know, we

589
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:08.200
do awful hardware, but terrible.
I don't know if I

590
00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.970
can go on after this
really. I think this is

591
00:30:09.970 --> 00:30:12.360
it it's over half. I,
I feel like I should

592
00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.480
go and become a hipster
and like get like on

593
00:30:15.540 --> 00:30:17.700
a Mac book air and
just hang out at 15

594
00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:20.970
inch, you know, the 15
inch MacBook air, Just reject

595
00:30:20.970 --> 00:30:23.580
all technology. Just switch to
iPad. Let me see. I'm

596
00:30:23.580 --> 00:30:26.580
looking at my, my Lenovo,
my main lab Top and

597
00:30:26.580 --> 00:30:32.820
it is 1920 by 1200.
Right? That's so 1900 by

598
00:30:32.820 --> 00:30:35.870
1200. That's the Rose. Wow.
That's high rise. Yeah. And

599
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.450
it's nice at this point,
let's see about a 15

600
00:30:39.450 --> 00:30:43.920
and a half inch. So
it's really, really high. Hi

601
00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:46.800
DPI. So I started looking
at this, this new Sandy

602
00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:49.650
bridge, a Lenovo laptop. I
think it's the w five

603
00:30:49.650 --> 00:30:52.680
20 and it's just beautiful.
It's amazing. It's like twice

604
00:30:52.680 --> 00:30:56.010
as fast as this laptop,
But the resolution of the

605
00:30:56.010 --> 00:31:02.790
screen is, is low. It's
like once you've been at

606
00:31:02.790 --> 00:31:05.070
1900, 1920 or something like
that, you know, and you're

607
00:31:05.070 --> 00:31:08.730
like really can do tool
two full pages of texts

608
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.450
side by side. Then it's
really hard to go back.

609
00:31:12.510 --> 00:31:18.630
So yeah, it is. There's
a first world problem. High

610
00:31:18.630 --> 00:31:21.840
Rez displays are kind of
rare on laptops. So if

611
00:31:21.840 --> 00:31:24.330
that's something you want, you
gotta be careful. Cause I

612
00:31:24.330 --> 00:31:27.270
don't think Apple even really
does that. Do they super

613
00:31:27.270 --> 00:31:30.000
high red? They don't, they
don't. And, and speaking of

614
00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.670
super, do you have an
iPad or nine? I have

615
00:31:32.670 --> 00:31:37.410
the iPhone four. So I
have an iPad and iPad

616
00:31:37.410 --> 00:31:41.400
too. And it's So frustrating
to me that I've got

617
00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:44.940
the retina display, right? Oh
yeah. It ruins you. And

618
00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:48.240
then I go to the
iPad and I don't tell

619
00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:50.690
you when the iPad came
out, I looked at it.

620
00:31:50.700 --> 00:31:52.270
I was like, okay, these
pixels are like bigger as,

621
00:31:52.270 --> 00:31:54.360
as big as my head.
That was like, even before

622
00:31:54.360 --> 00:31:57.120
I had seen an iPhone
four, I was unhappy. Once

623
00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.160
I saw the iPhone four,
I was like, okay, I

624
00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.920
can't, I can't touch an
iPad. No, it's awful. That's

625
00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.130
awful. It ruins you. Cause
high Rez is awesome. Like

626
00:32:05.130 --> 00:32:07.290
I'm with you on that.
I think the advantage that

627
00:32:07.290 --> 00:32:09.480
Apple has is with iOS
and stuff, as they can

628
00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.690
design almost from the beginning,
if your iOS is what

629
00:32:12.690 --> 00:32:15.060
like three years old, four
years old, something like that.

630
00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:17.580
This is like, go back
to windows timeframe. This would

631
00:32:17.580 --> 00:32:20.880
be like windows one, two,
three. Yeah. That's a while

632
00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:23.460
back. You're still in the
part of the process where

633
00:32:23.460 --> 00:32:26.250
you can sort of redefine
everything. So they aren't locked

634
00:32:26.250 --> 00:32:29.850
into all this resolution crap
that even <inaudible>, you know,

635
00:32:29.850 --> 00:32:32.880
on the Mac has doesn't
do resolution independence very well.

636
00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:34.830
Well, you know why, you
know, I finally figured this

637
00:32:34.830 --> 00:32:37.020
out. I started digging into
like how this stuff works.

638
00:32:37.020 --> 00:32:38.850
Cause you want to understand,
you know, the, the underneath

639
00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:43.490
it turns out that like
always 10 is basically it's

640
00:32:43.490 --> 00:32:48.830
like held together with just
transparent PNGs. Like everything is

641
00:32:48.830 --> 00:32:53.270
a PNG, all of it,
everything, every button, every wounded

642
00:32:53.270 --> 00:32:58.070
corner, everything that's pretty on
an iPad or an iPhone

643
00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:00.620
is a, is a PNG.
That's transparent. That's in a

644
00:33:00.620 --> 00:33:04.760
zip file somewhere. And the,
the reason that windows never,

645
00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:06.590
ever could do that is
we have that ability to

646
00:33:06.590 --> 00:33:09.500
go use large fonts, remember
like the whole large font

647
00:33:09.530 --> 00:33:14.300
crisis of the late nineties.
Right. And that was right

648
00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.930
before the national news right
before the ninth 98 cookie

649
00:33:17.930 --> 00:33:22.160
panic. Yes. You have cookies
enabled. You remember that everyone

650
00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.500
was freaking out. Although every
time I spoke, I spent

651
00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:26.510
most of the late nineties
explaining to my boss that

652
00:33:26.510 --> 00:33:29.630
cookies were not going to
kill his family. Do I

653
00:33:29.630 --> 00:33:31.310
have to try? I need
to, I should disable cookies.

654
00:33:31.310 --> 00:33:34.550
Right? It's like the JavaScript
panics of the two thousands.

655
00:33:36.310 --> 00:33:40.510
Right? Exactly. Exactly. It's a
tricky problem. And I think,

656
00:33:40.780 --> 00:33:43.630
you know, it's funny too,
because Steve jobs was at

657
00:33:43.630 --> 00:33:45.910
next for so long and
next, as I recall, I

658
00:33:45.910 --> 00:33:49.480
had like display postscript, which
is, you know, the, the,

659
00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.810
the Holy grail of like
resizable UIs. Right. Is it

660
00:33:52.810 --> 00:33:54.820
not, I don't know a
ton about displaced postscript, but

661
00:33:55.270 --> 00:33:59.290
it's postscript. I mean, designed
for print. Right. Presumably, so

662
00:33:59.290 --> 00:34:01.690
like we've gone from that,
which was kind of the

663
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:04.510
future to like, and I
guess the web is kind

664
00:34:04.510 --> 00:34:08.020
of scalable. I mean, it's
more scalable, You know, <inaudible>

665
00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:10.120
is supposed to be kind
of scalable. Remember how everyone

666
00:34:10.150 --> 00:34:13.240
got all in a twist
because they decided to make

667
00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:17.530
texts look really pretty and
not be pixel dependent. Right.

668
00:34:17.860 --> 00:34:19.450
And now Firefox is doing
it and it was like,

669
00:34:19.450 --> 00:34:22.270
it's blurry. Yeah. You know,
I've kind of gotten over

670
00:34:22.270 --> 00:34:24.220
that a little bit. I
was really bitter about that.

671
00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.750
Yeah. I don't know. Well,
it's funny. I always hear

672
00:34:28.750 --> 00:34:30.730
people like I have a
horrible headache, you know what

673
00:34:30.730 --> 00:34:34.090
I mean? I have a
medical condition that prevents me

674
00:34:34.090 --> 00:34:38.290
from using anti-elitist fonts. Yeah.
It's you know, you know,

675
00:34:38.290 --> 00:34:39.610
what I've decided is, cause
I wrote about this a

676
00:34:39.610 --> 00:34:42.280
long time ago when Joel
had mentioned something about how

677
00:34:42.290 --> 00:34:45.040
Mac font rendering was different.
Safari came out for the

678
00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.820
PC, remember, and it actually
offered that font rendering mode.

679
00:34:48.820 --> 00:34:50.710
So I was able to
sort of experience it firsthand

680
00:34:51.250 --> 00:34:54.490
and neither one is really
wrong, you know? And I

681
00:34:54.490 --> 00:34:55.810
think font rendering is one
of the things where like

682
00:34:55.810 --> 00:34:57.550
once you get used to
seeing it a certain way,

683
00:34:58.270 --> 00:35:02.140
that's what you expect. Yes.
I do think they have

684
00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:03.760
to be clear. I do
have a position on this.

685
00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:08.380
My position is on, on
low DPI displays. It is

686
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:10.270
better to do it the
way Microsoft does it without

687
00:35:10.270 --> 00:35:13.690
a doubt. Well, high DPI
display. It doesn't matter. Well,

688
00:35:13.690 --> 00:35:15.490
no, no, no. It does
matter on high DPA displays.

689
00:35:15.490 --> 00:35:16.930
It's better to do it
the way Apple does it.

690
00:35:16.950 --> 00:35:19.270
Cause it's, it gives you
perfect font fidelity. Like you

691
00:35:19.270 --> 00:35:21.550
don't compromise on the, I
see what you're saying. So

692
00:35:21.790 --> 00:35:27.460
you basically, Microsoft solved the
font issue with software and

693
00:35:27.850 --> 00:35:32.380
Apple solved it with hardware,
specifically high DPI displays Kind

694
00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:35.380
of, I mean kind of,
but I think the Microsoft

695
00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:37.890
approach is wrong and high
DPI. And I would also

696
00:35:37.890 --> 00:35:40.370
say the Apple approaches were
wrong at low DPI. It's

697
00:35:40.370 --> 00:35:42.980
interesting that you say that
because I think it's so

698
00:35:42.980 --> 00:35:45.140
funny as I, as I
do a lot of flying

699
00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:50.870
around and traveling, I see
old men reading on their

700
00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.070
iPads and Jack the phone
up. Sure. Yeah. And they

701
00:35:55.070 --> 00:35:59.000
have these giant fonts. Right.
And I think that it

702
00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:03.260
is kind of silly of
them and I'm always using,

703
00:36:03.270 --> 00:36:05.600
and I don't read on
my iPad. Right. And I

704
00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:09.680
don't want to back lit
poor font, rendering kind of

705
00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:12.080
thing. Shining in my eyes.
I use a Kindle cause

706
00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:15.530
it's basically paper. And I
always think it's so funny

707
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:18.020
that, that they, they, they
Jack the font up like

708
00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:21.740
that. I really liked the
Kindle. I was so impressed.

709
00:36:21.740 --> 00:36:23.660
Like I had never seen
it used every day. I

710
00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:26.450
had never seen the ink,
but man, I was so

711
00:36:26.450 --> 00:36:28.910
impressed with that. I mean,
obviously it sucks for non

712
00:36:28.910 --> 00:36:33.440
reading for reading. It's like,
wow, I really get it.

713
00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.510
And the other thing that's
cool about the Kindle. It's

714
00:36:35.510 --> 00:36:37.610
cool because you can't do
anything else with it because

715
00:36:37.610 --> 00:36:39.380
when you sit down with
the Kindle, you're not going

716
00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:41.570
to go play frigging, any
birds, angry birds. You're not

717
00:36:41.570 --> 00:36:43.130
going to go, Oh, I'll
see, what's on tech meme

718
00:36:43.130 --> 00:36:45.650
right now. You know, you
can't do that crap. Like

719
00:36:45.680 --> 00:36:47.930
you're forced to focus and
say, look, I'm going to

720
00:36:47.930 --> 00:36:49.880
read a book. Like this
is a book reading advice.

721
00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.670
I'm going to read a
whole bunch of writing. Right.

722
00:36:53.030 --> 00:36:54.770
Which is awesome. Like as
a writer, you should be

723
00:36:54.770 --> 00:36:57.320
excited about this. Like wow.
A device that gets people

724
00:36:57.320 --> 00:36:58.820
to sit down and read
without like click, click, click,

725
00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:01.100
click, click, click clicking as
fast as they can. Yeah.

726
00:37:01.130 --> 00:37:02.570
Yeah. You know, it's funny.
Everyone's like, Oh, it's so

727
00:37:02.570 --> 00:37:05.180
great. That task switching and
multitasking came back to the

728
00:37:05.180 --> 00:37:07.790
iPad and I'm like, Oh
no. Now I can do

729
00:37:07.790 --> 00:37:11.660
other things and be distracted.
You know, double clicking is

730
00:37:11.660 --> 00:37:15.140
all it takes. Yeah. And
you know, it's, it's ironic

731
00:37:15.140 --> 00:37:17.360
because one of my first
reactions life, one was like,

732
00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:19.130
this is going to kill
Nintendo. Like I was like,

733
00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.490
I've spent, I haven't known
that many Nintendo devices, but

734
00:37:22.490 --> 00:37:25.400
I have owned like a
game boy advance and a

735
00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:28.010
few other things. And that
stuff is pricey. And I

736
00:37:28.010 --> 00:37:30.110
was noticing like on the
iPhone, like I have games

737
00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.140
for free that are like
full commercial games that are

738
00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:35.150
just free. You know, they
have this periods of giving

739
00:37:35.150 --> 00:37:37.430
things or just like a
dollar or something like for

740
00:37:37.430 --> 00:37:39.740
a cup of coffee, I
can get a game that's

741
00:37:39.740 --> 00:37:41.870
going to give me about
the same enjoyment, say a

742
00:37:41.870 --> 00:37:44.150
few hours, whatever. Cause I
don't have, I guess if

743
00:37:44.150 --> 00:37:45.860
you're a kid you have
infinite times you could play

744
00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:48.440
for hours and hours. But
as you get older, you

745
00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.440
know, a couple hours is
good. Right. I'm done well.

746
00:37:50.450 --> 00:37:53.630
Yeah. I don't have the
patience anymore. Yeah. And man,

747
00:37:53.690 --> 00:37:55.880
I mean, there's more games
for like a tiny bit.

748
00:37:55.880 --> 00:37:58.040
Well dude, I'm playing. Have
you played on my iPad?

749
00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.110
I'm looking at my iPad.
I actually have like the

750
00:38:00.110 --> 00:38:02.720
kids' games. And then I
have daddy's games like are

751
00:38:02.720 --> 00:38:05.450
in like a little corner
of the thing. Cause I've

752
00:38:05.450 --> 00:38:07.910
been relegated to the corner
and I've got the splinter

753
00:38:07.910 --> 00:38:12.200
cell dead space, like dead
space. HD is as good

754
00:38:12.200 --> 00:38:14.240
as anything. You'd get on
it. Like a PlayStation two.

755
00:38:14.840 --> 00:38:17.060
I've heard good things. I
like dead space. I played

756
00:38:17.060 --> 00:38:19.070
the first dead space and
I enjoyed it. Dead space

757
00:38:19.070 --> 00:38:21.530
on an I phone would
be hard just because it's

758
00:38:21.530 --> 00:38:25.010
so tiny, but on the
iPad, it's really amazing. And

759
00:38:25.010 --> 00:38:27.290
now there's a thing called
order and chaos. It's basically

760
00:38:27.290 --> 00:38:31.070
world of Warcraft for eyes,
for iPad. Oh yeah. That's

761
00:38:31.070 --> 00:38:32.750
my game loft is yeah,
Yeah. Yeah. I mean the

762
00:38:32.750 --> 00:38:34.830
graphics, you know, you, you
know that it's iPad and

763
00:38:34.990 --> 00:38:37.750
I pad to me cause
the graphics are, you know,

764
00:38:37.750 --> 00:38:41.860
at their PlayStation to ask.
Right. But presumably they'll, they'll

765
00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.230
get that figured out at
some point, I mean dramatically

766
00:38:46.230 --> 00:38:49.740
better. It's just, they're waiting
for the adoption to catch

767
00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.780
up. Actually, the part that
I didn't get to finish

768
00:38:51.810 --> 00:38:53.580
last time, a minute ago
when I was mentioning was

769
00:38:53.580 --> 00:38:55.980
that I don't like that.
If I take a retina

770
00:38:55.980 --> 00:38:59.040
display application from my iPhone
four and I put it

771
00:38:59.040 --> 00:39:02.190
on my iPad, it's not
retina display, even though there's

772
00:39:02.190 --> 00:39:04.890
enough pixels for it to
be, they make, they make

773
00:39:04.890 --> 00:39:07.890
a small resolution, like an
iPad, like an iPhone three.

774
00:39:07.890 --> 00:39:10.380
And then they doubled the
pixel double it. Oh really?

775
00:39:10.410 --> 00:39:13.410
Yeah. Even if there's an
iPhone four mode, It ignores

776
00:39:13.410 --> 00:39:16.380
it. Wow. Yeah. It's really
an awful. Do you remember

777
00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:18.930
back in the day when
you do that because they're

778
00:39:18.930 --> 00:39:20.510
idiots and they don't want
you to, I don't know.

779
00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:22.020
They don't, they don't want
to do it. It's awful

780
00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.560
because you wouldn't need to
write an iPad application then.

781
00:39:25.590 --> 00:39:27.870
Right. You wouldn't write an
iPad custom app. You would

782
00:39:27.870 --> 00:39:32.790
write Right. Be lazy. I
go, no, no, it looks

783
00:39:32.790 --> 00:39:35.150
great. See, I did it
for retina. It's only like

784
00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:38.070
a, like a hundred pixels
off. Right. It's like night

785
00:39:38.100 --> 00:39:40.080
it's like, was it like
nine 60 by something, right?

786
00:39:40.620 --> 00:39:45.600
Yeah. Yeah. So it's laziness.
But it reminds me of

787
00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:47.160
the time when the Palm
pilot, if you don't know,

788
00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:49.050
if you remember this, remember
when Palm pilots were one

789
00:39:49.050 --> 00:39:52.830
60 by one 60. Yes.
That was the resolution. Right.

790
00:39:52.890 --> 00:39:54.960
And I wrote up my,
my diabetes application for it

791
00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:58.680
and then Palm four came
out or pump three and

792
00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.080
then it was like three
20 by three 20. What

793
00:40:01.080 --> 00:40:03.630
are we going to do?
Oh, pixel double everything. Right?

794
00:40:04.290 --> 00:40:07.110
So then you had blurry,
you had blurry pixel doubled

795
00:40:07.260 --> 00:40:10.380
applications and you had, you
know, high res applications. And

796
00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:12.990
then it was the exact
same thing. And I mean,

797
00:40:12.990 --> 00:40:14.400
I'm not, I'm not in
any way trying to take

798
00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:18.210
away from like, from what
these guys have done, like

799
00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:20.520
iPad and I, but it's
like, man, some of these

800
00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.290
20 year olds just don't
remember it, man. I was

801
00:40:22.290 --> 00:40:24.450
rocking the pit, the Palm
pilot, you know what I

802
00:40:24.450 --> 00:40:26.970
mean? I was living the
tablet dream. I felt like

803
00:40:26.970 --> 00:40:31.350
I was Wesley crusher on,
on my Palm five. You

804
00:40:31.350 --> 00:40:34.560
know, these kids weren't born
when the Paul five came

805
00:40:34.560 --> 00:40:38.130
out, I'm talking about, I'm
like I'm turning into such

806
00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.900
a get off my lawn
guy. Well, what was I

807
00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:44.820
thinking about just the other
day of something else that

808
00:40:45.750 --> 00:40:48.360
where, Oh, this concept of
buying a CD, like I

809
00:40:48.360 --> 00:40:50.880
think is so dead now,
you know, like this idea

810
00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:53.010
of like, you'd have some
physical, you'd go to a

811
00:40:53.010 --> 00:40:57.300
store to buy a silver
disk. That's your music? Like,

812
00:40:57.300 --> 00:41:01.170
how inconvenient is that? Right?
Like who does this anymore?

813
00:41:02.250 --> 00:41:04.080
And like, like, you know,
Henry and you're, you're, you're

814
00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:06.150
my son and, and your
son, like, they're not gonna,

815
00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:09.210
I mean, this will be
a totally alien concept to

816
00:41:09.210 --> 00:41:11.370
them. It'll be like showing
them like, you know, I

817
00:41:11.370 --> 00:41:14.700
don't know a horse and
carriage or something. Exactly. Exactly.

818
00:41:15.060 --> 00:41:16.950
I mean, it hasn't really
been that long. That's the

819
00:41:16.950 --> 00:41:20.460
crazy thing, you know, or
even modems, like who, who

820
00:41:20.460 --> 00:41:22.800
remembers modems now? I mean,
there's kids now that, Oh

821
00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:25.590
yeah. Twitter. I made a
joke on Twitter yesterday. I

822
00:41:25.590 --> 00:41:29.550
was like, you know, Oh
no, no carrier, no responses.

823
00:41:29.820 --> 00:41:32.100
That was comedy gold. And
no one said a word

824
00:41:32.130 --> 00:41:34.460
and I was just like,
Oh man, really? Are we

825
00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:38.960
all 12 wrong with you?
People it's awful. Oh, Hey.

826
00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.680
So two questions. One, we
just talked for half an

827
00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.380
hour about awesome stuff. I
think this is a Hansel

828
00:41:45.380 --> 00:41:48.350
minutes. So I'll just save
this and bleep out the

829
00:41:48.350 --> 00:41:52.160
swear words. And that's a
show. Okay, fine. Okay. To,

830
00:41:53.030 --> 00:41:55.070
I wanted to talk to
you like literally five, 10

831
00:41:55.070 --> 00:42:01.550
minutes about the, the whole
crash, the great crash of,

832
00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:06.200
of stack overflow, because we
wanted more kind of grubby

833
00:42:06.200 --> 00:42:12.410
tasks specifically because Sam had
a particular moment that he

834
00:42:12.410 --> 00:42:14.990
described that we just thought
was too amazing, but you

835
00:42:14.990 --> 00:42:16.430
weren't there to make the
decisions. So he had to

836
00:42:16.430 --> 00:42:18.650
make it on his own.
So I wanted to paint

837
00:42:18.650 --> 00:42:19.880
that picture and then get
to this a little bit

838
00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.550
audio from you. Cool. Okay.
So I want to hang

839
00:42:22.550 --> 00:42:32.590
up on you save this
audio, call you, right? <inaudible>.
