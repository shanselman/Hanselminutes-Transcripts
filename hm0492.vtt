From hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel minutes,

8
00:00:49.460 --> 00:00:53.450
a weekly discussion with web
developer and technologist Scott Hanselman.

9
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:58.010
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number four 96. In this

10
00:00:58.010 --> 00:01:02.660
episode, Scott talks with Sylvia
Richardson, an accessibility coordinator for

11
00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:06.830
blue cross blue shield of
North Carolina about non-web based assisted

12
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:14.600
technologies. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:14.600 --> 00:01:17.330
of Hansel minutes. And today
we're chatting with Sylvia Richardson.

14
00:01:17.840 --> 00:01:20.630
She's the accessibility coordinator for
blue cross blue shield of

15
00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.380
North Carolina, and does accessibility as
her day job, but we're

16
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:27.260
not going to talk about
web based accessibility. Are we?

17
00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.500
No, I wanted to talk
a little bit about some

18
00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:34.730
really neat developments in a
non web based assistive technology,

19
00:01:35.320 --> 00:01:38.960
physical devices that can help
people access the world. You

20
00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.170
know, in a time when
everyone's talking about wearables, it

21
00:01:42.170 --> 00:01:44.090
seems like people say wearables,
but all they really mean

22
00:01:44.090 --> 00:01:47.000
is like a Fitbit, but
the real innovation is happening

23
00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.790
in wearables that are assisting
people and people who are

24
00:01:49.790 --> 00:01:53.990
differently abled. That's true. One
of my very favorite wearables

25
00:01:53.990 --> 00:01:57.800
to talk about, because it's
just kind of cool is

26
00:01:57.890 --> 00:02:03.500
a product called Orkambe or
cam. It's basically a way

27
00:02:03.500 --> 00:02:07.250
to turn yourself into a
cyborg. There's a small camera

28
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.240
that clips to a pair
of eyeglasses, a bone conductive

29
00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:14.390
headphone, and then a small
computer. And basically this is

30
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:20.390
just peop people who have
taken existing technologies, small cameras,

31
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:23.150
like they use in products
like Google glass, bone, conductive

32
00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.180
headphones. A lot of swimmers
use. Those are people who

33
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.080
want to run in traffic
and then people, and then

34
00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:36.050
OCR, optical character recognition technology.
And basically the camera records

35
00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:38.960
the environment around and then
the person wearing it can

36
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.190
trigger it. And it will
read text to the user.

37
00:02:43.190 --> 00:02:47.300
So not just web pages
and phone texts, but newspapers

38
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:51.410
signs menus. You can also
program it to do some

39
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:54.350
things like facial recognition. You
can program it to help

40
00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.110
you recognize the products you
buy most at the grocery

41
00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:01.570
store. And basically then the
tiny computer whispers in your

42
00:03:01.570 --> 00:03:03.880
ear and reads things to
you. And it's a really

43
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.240
great tool for building independence
so that you can go

44
00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:09.760
out and do the sort
of things that you need

45
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.190
to do to live your
life. Even with you, don't

46
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:15.310
see very well. And you
get to be a cyborg.

47
00:03:16.090 --> 00:03:19.830
How fun is that? As,
as a cyborg and someone

48
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.740
who's got at least two
devices that are medical based

49
00:03:22.740 --> 00:03:26.130
attached to me, I am
all about augmented technologies like

50
00:03:26.130 --> 00:03:28.950
that. I wonder though, you
do you have to point

51
00:03:28.950 --> 00:03:31.500
at the thing you want
it to read or how

52
00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:34.200
does it know? You do
have to point. So it's

53
00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.250
a technology for people who
have some residual vision, but

54
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:41.310
most people who are legally
blind do have enough vision

55
00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:45.000
to be able to recognize
a text, whether it's upside

56
00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:46.470
down to writes it up
and point to it, to

57
00:03:46.470 --> 00:03:49.560
trigger. Oh, okay. So you
let's say maybe you're sitting

58
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.770
in at a menu and
you've got whatever level of

59
00:03:52.770 --> 00:03:55.080
vision that you've got. You
pointed the menu and then

60
00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.630
it OCR, is it in
real time and reads it

61
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:01.950
to you? Yes. And their
big innovation is actually OCR

62
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:07.080
on flexible surfaces. So we're
really, really good at OCRN

63
00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:09.840
flat things and not as
good at OCR and things

64
00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:12.720
that are bent. So one
of this, the technologies has

65
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:15.840
company has been heavily focused
on is working with things

66
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:19.710
that are bent or warped,
or for example, the number

67
00:04:19.710 --> 00:04:22.650
on a bus, things that
are moving. And at least

68
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.690
from the demos I've seen,
it looks like it's pretty

69
00:04:24.690 --> 00:04:27.780
solid. That sounds amazing that
it reminds me of two

70
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:30.960
different things. First it reminds
me of that was at

71
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:33.240
Google goggles where you could
point it at something and

72
00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:36.210
it would say that's an
Apple. Yeah. Google glass. I

73
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:40.110
think Not Google glass, the
headphones, but Google goggles, the

74
00:04:40.770 --> 00:04:46.050
object recognition software. I think
it's an Android app. You

75
00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:48.750
basically take a picture of
a painting or a landmark

76
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.800
or a popular image and
goggles would say, Oh, you're

77
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.070
looking at the Mona Lisa
It's yes, it's a similar

78
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:00.840
technology, except it doesn't require
internet connectivity. Everything is local.

79
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:05.040
And in the onboard computer,
you don't need internet connection

80
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:09.360
all the time. And so
that you're not exchanging video

81
00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.910
of your daily life with
a weird server somewhere where

82
00:05:11.910 --> 00:05:15.150
there could be security issues.
That's a really good, that's

83
00:05:15.150 --> 00:05:18.150
a really interesting point that
it's in that that's something

84
00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:21.930
be entirely self contained is
an important scenario that I

85
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:23.550
wouldn't have thought of. But
if you're on the subway,

86
00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:25.290
you'd want it to read
to you, even though you're

87
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:29.550
in a tunnel Exactly. Or
in your home or walking

88
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.210
around, has people like me
who are firmly attached to

89
00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:39.630
their iPhones, no internet signal
is not great everywhere. And

90
00:05:39.630 --> 00:05:41.700
it looks like from their
website, they said that in

91
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:43.950
the future, it'll be able
to tell you the color

92
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:47.580
of your shirt reads, you
know, read outdoor signs and

93
00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:49.980
things that you can't necessarily
touch, which sounds pretty amazing

94
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:54.030
as well. Yes. And the
great thing about it is

95
00:05:54.030 --> 00:05:56.790
once you have the hardware,
it's much, it's easy for

96
00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:00.110
them to push software updates.
So it's a technology you

97
00:06:00.110 --> 00:06:02.930
can buy at admittedly, a
very high price point. I

98
00:06:02.930 --> 00:06:06.860
think it's $3,500 or so
that will actually improve over

99
00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.640
time. Have you seen that
software that can do real

100
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:13.360
time translation where you, you
do augmented reality, you pointed

101
00:06:13.360 --> 00:06:15.880
like a Spanish sign and
it puts English over the

102
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:19.600
top. I have seen the
YouTube videos of that and

103
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:24.430
it actually looks really kind
of fun. Translation is an

104
00:06:24.430 --> 00:06:27.010
imprecise science, but it probably
will help you with street

105
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:31.120
signs. Absolutely. And I'm kind
of expanding that, thinking about

106
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:33.100
all the different kinds of
Lego pieces, one could snap

107
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.430
together that could mean a
blind traveler could go somewhere

108
00:06:36.430 --> 00:06:39.010
and be in a foreign
country and somewhat find their

109
00:06:39.010 --> 00:06:43.660
way around. That's really amazing.
When you were talking about

110
00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:47.860
wearables earlier, you mentioned Fitbits
and other sort of activity

111
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.510
trackers. Another technology I wanted
to highlight is a smartwatch

112
00:06:52.540 --> 00:06:57.040
called embrace. It has the
same basic functionality as a

113
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.920
Fitbit or an Apple watch
or any of the other

114
00:06:59.920 --> 00:07:05.890
standard activity trackers, but it
also has sensors that measure

115
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:11.230
some kind of capacitive skin
resistance. I'm not quite clear

116
00:07:11.230 --> 00:07:14.560
on the science that isn't
a useful proxy for detecting

117
00:07:14.890 --> 00:07:19.510
oncoming seizures and people with
epilepsy. So if you have

118
00:07:19.510 --> 00:07:21.310
the right type of epilepsy,
the kind that can be

119
00:07:21.310 --> 00:07:25.210
measured this way, basically the
smartwatch can alert you if

120
00:07:25.210 --> 00:07:27.790
you're about to have a
seizure and they have paired

121
00:07:27.820 --> 00:07:30.280
smartwatches, that can be a
parent and a child or

122
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.400
a caregiver and an adult
so that if someone is

123
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.090
having a seizure, it can
alert the caregiver and give

124
00:07:37.090 --> 00:07:40.030
them morning to go and
help. And that's again, just

125
00:07:40.030 --> 00:07:43.990
a really neat way to
take a technology that exists.

126
00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:46.570
And that is cool and
that your kids might actually

127
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.820
want to wear, but also
has this bonus medical option,

128
00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:56.080
Stuff like that is so
significant. I don't think unless

129
00:07:56.080 --> 00:07:59.350
someone has a problem that
is a significant medical problem

130
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:01.060
that would require something like
that. It's kind of hard

131
00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:04.600
to imagine, but I work
on an, a, an open

132
00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:06.760
source project with a bunch
of really smart people called

133
00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:09.790
Nightscout, which is a watch
that lets you see someone

134
00:08:09.790 --> 00:08:13.990
else's blood sugar remotely. And
that same idea that like

135
00:08:14.020 --> 00:08:16.330
the, the child is asleep
and whether it be epilepsy

136
00:08:16.330 --> 00:08:19.210
or diabetes, you know, if
like, like as they say,

137
00:08:19.210 --> 00:08:21.460
if Timmy needs you, he
needs you right now and

138
00:08:21.460 --> 00:08:24.160
you need to be able
to, to manage that situation.

139
00:08:24.340 --> 00:08:27.610
And now we can with
these kinds of technologies, But

140
00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.430
it also means that your
child has the freedom to

141
00:08:30.430 --> 00:08:33.220
walk around and you can
feel comfort in knowing they're

142
00:08:33.220 --> 00:08:34.930
not going to have a
seizure when they're in the

143
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.840
bathroom. So you don't have
to follow them. It's just

144
00:08:37.900 --> 00:08:40.840
the same idea as the
Orkambi. It's about building independence

145
00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:45.910
and apparently the biofeedback can
also be useful for measuring

146
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:49.480
stress levels. For example, for
people with an autism spectrum

147
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:53.650
disorder, sometimes it can help
be helpful to measure stress

148
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:57.450
levels and provide biofeedback that
a caregiver can know when

149
00:08:57.450 --> 00:09:00.060
a child who's nonverbal or
not good at communicating their

150
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:03.360
needs is feeling stressed and
can remove them from the

151
00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.660
situation before it becomes a
bigger problem with a meltdown.

152
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:10.520
That's a really good point.
I think that the biofeedback

153
00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:13.730
aspect of, of these things,
that, that the wearables, the

154
00:09:13.730 --> 00:09:16.610
idea that it's giving you
a sixth sense, whether it

155
00:09:16.610 --> 00:09:19.250
be stress or blood pressure,
or even the people who

156
00:09:19.250 --> 00:09:21.890
use them for heart rate,
it gives you insight into

157
00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.800
what's going on inside your
body and then theoretically, a

158
00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:29.360
positive loop happens. Doesn't it
that causes you to change

159
00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.340
your behavior or adjust your
behavior to make your life

160
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:36.020
better. Exactly. It's the same
reason that I wear just

161
00:09:36.020 --> 00:09:39.320
a regular Fitbit because I'm
not very good at knowing

162
00:09:39.320 --> 00:09:41.990
when I'm exercising enough or
getting enough sleep. I just

163
00:09:41.990 --> 00:09:43.940
don't have that level of
self awareness. But if I

164
00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.910
have a graph that I
share with all my friends

165
00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:51.140
and family, I have both
the social feedback and the

166
00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:54.290
sort of data feedback that
lets me change my behaviors

167
00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.830
and actually go for a
walk. Yeah, definitely. I know

168
00:09:57.830 --> 00:10:00.350
that yesterday was my, I
think it was my first

169
00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:03.500
day back from work from
being on vacation. And suddenly

170
00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:06.110
I went from 10,000 plus
steps to like a thousand.

171
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:07.850
And at the end of
the day, I was like,

172
00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.680
I don't feel good. And
I don't really know why.

173
00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.390
And then I look at
the thing and it says,

174
00:10:11.390 --> 00:10:13.640
I've gone 1500 steps today.
And I'm like, Oh my

175
00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:17.660
goodness, I'm going to die.
So I went out immediately

176
00:10:17.690 --> 00:10:19.490
to try to run around
and get my steps before

177
00:10:19.490 --> 00:10:22.970
the end of the day.
Exactly. That feedback is just

178
00:10:22.970 --> 00:10:25.970
really helpful, Absolutely being. And
also when I've traveled my

179
00:10:25.970 --> 00:10:28.970
wife being able to see
my blood sugar remotely, cause

180
00:10:28.970 --> 00:10:32.960
I'm diabetic has been hugely
important. She's even woken me

181
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:34.850
up in Germany and saying,
you're having a low blood

182
00:10:34.850 --> 00:10:36.170
sugar and you need to
get up and deal with

183
00:10:36.170 --> 00:10:38.810
it. Right? Oh, that's really
neat. What a device is

184
00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:41.990
that that's measuring blood sugar.
So I have a, what's

185
00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.430
called a Dexcom. It's a
Dexcom G four and it

186
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:50.330
uses a RF to talk
to a battery. That's plugged

187
00:10:50.330 --> 00:10:53.300
into my side. That's looking
at the sugar and the

188
00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:57.170
interstitial fluid. It's basic, it's
a cannular. They're stuck to

189
00:10:57.170 --> 00:11:00.710
me. It goes RF to
the device and then Bluetooth

190
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.740
to your phone and then
HTTP up to the cloud.

191
00:11:04.310 --> 00:11:06.680
And then once it's in
the cloud, someone can follow

192
00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:09.470
you or subscribe to your
blood sugar and get alerts

193
00:11:09.470 --> 00:11:11.750
or put it on their
Apple watch or with an

194
00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:15.020
open source project, put it
on a pebble and then,

195
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:17.300
and that's, and that's the
thing, right? Once that data

196
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:20.360
gets out, then people can
do whatever they want to

197
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:21.740
do with it. They could
make a picture frame with

198
00:11:21.740 --> 00:11:24.950
an Android tablet and say,
look, there's my stress level

199
00:11:25.340 --> 00:11:29.060
or my blood sugar, whatever
makes them happy. Exactly. And

200
00:11:29.060 --> 00:11:33.140
people think assistive technology is
boring. One of the reasons

201
00:11:33.140 --> 00:11:36.590
I really love talking about
tools like this is it

202
00:11:36.590 --> 00:11:41.030
highlights how building things, interesting
things that help people doesn't

203
00:11:41.030 --> 00:11:44.720
have to be about adding
labels to your forms. You

204
00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:48.860
should do that. You should
add labels, but that's not

205
00:11:49.010 --> 00:11:54.400
fun. Just like screen readers
are sort of useful technology,

206
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:58.000
but they're like Excel. If
you're super into Excel spreadsheets,

207
00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.600
you will enjoy talking about
them. Not so much everyone

208
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.860
else, but the conditions are
really right. I think now,

209
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:08.620
and in history or in,
at the time we are

210
00:12:08.620 --> 00:12:12.280
to really build these kinds
of technologies because of a

211
00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:16.240
couple of factors. One is
the rise of crowdfunding. If

212
00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.170
you are a somebody who's
developed a technology that would

213
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:24.220
be useful to people with
visual or hearing disabilities, it

214
00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:27.040
can be hard to convince
a major company to fund

215
00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:29.140
you, even though there's a
market. And you know, there's

216
00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:33.910
a market venture capitalists, aren't
always on board with this,

217
00:12:33.910 --> 00:12:37.570
but with something like Indiegogo
or a Kickstarter, you can

218
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:41.440
build these technologies and share
them with social media and

219
00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.540
reach the people that they
need to reach, who are

220
00:12:43.540 --> 00:12:46.480
really passionate about these technologies
and have a real need

221
00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.180
for them. And then you
can take advantage of all

222
00:12:49.180 --> 00:12:52.270
the, all the technologies and
systems we use to build

223
00:12:52.270 --> 00:12:55.000
all the things we kick
start or rapid prototyping, three

224
00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:00.190
D printing connections with factories
abroad and build these things

225
00:13:00.190 --> 00:13:01.990
and get them to market
in a way that just

226
00:13:01.990 --> 00:13:06.060
wasn't easily, possible 10 years
ago. And it also seems

227
00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.480
like the objects that we
have available to us off

228
00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:11.250
the shelf, you know, that
I don't have to go

229
00:13:11.250 --> 00:13:15.150
and design a wireless secure
protocol. I can use Bluetooth

230
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.370
Ellie, or, you know, I
don't need to develop a

231
00:13:18.370 --> 00:13:21.150
new processor. I can just
go to ADA fruit and

232
00:13:21.150 --> 00:13:23.880
figure out what the right
thing for my devices means

233
00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:27.480
that presumably we can create
small, simple things like, like

234
00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:30.720
embrace started as a Kickstarter.
Didn't it? The epilepsy watch.

235
00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:34.110
Yeah. I think it was
an Indiegogo or something similar.

236
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:37.470
And you don't need to
necessarily say we're going to

237
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:41.460
sell 50 million of these, right.
It might be niche, but

238
00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:44.370
it's important. And because I
can take these pieces off

239
00:13:44.370 --> 00:13:47.310
the shelf and prototype them
quickly, crowdsource them and then

240
00:13:47.310 --> 00:13:50.370
build them. It lowers the
bar and the barrier to

241
00:13:50.370 --> 00:13:56.220
entry for new devices. Exactly.
And then it also lets

242
00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.390
people use those components in
innovative ways. Another project that

243
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.450
recently got funded on Indiegogo
and I believe it got

244
00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:06.060
maybe a million dollars in
funding. It was very popular,

245
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.800
is a device called Erik.
So when people think of

246
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.290
disabilities, they often think of
people who are blind or

247
00:14:13.290 --> 00:14:15.690
in a wheelchair, but chronic
illness can be a real

248
00:14:15.690 --> 00:14:18.810
source of disability. Like you
were talking about diabetes. And

249
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.450
one of the most common
chronic illnesses in the United States

250
00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:25.200
is a sleep apnea and
to treat sleep apnea where

251
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:28.770
basically your soft palate collapses
when you're sleeping and you

252
00:14:28.770 --> 00:14:31.590
snore really loudly and sometimes
stop breathing, which is not

253
00:14:31.590 --> 00:14:34.320
great for your health. The
current treatment for it are

254
00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:38.430
these giant terrible machines where
you wear a huge face

255
00:14:38.430 --> 00:14:41.040
mask that makes you look
like a Batman villain and

256
00:14:41.040 --> 00:14:45.090
it pops all night and
they're really inconvenient and uncomfortable

257
00:14:45.390 --> 00:14:47.880
and keep your sleep partners
awake. And no one wears

258
00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:52.850
them because they're terrible. So
the people developed airing looked

259
00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:56.180
at the tiny, tiny fans
that are used in microprocessors

260
00:14:56.930 --> 00:14:59.840
and thought, I bet we
can attach these to someone's

261
00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:03.650
nose. Basically the little tiny
fans that we use to

262
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:07.790
cool, these cool microprocessors and
other tiny devices do produce

263
00:15:07.790 --> 00:15:10.550
enough positive pressure that they
can be used as a

264
00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:15.830
CPAP device. And they've developed
this tiny, disposable little thing.

265
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:17.690
It looks like nose plugs
that you would wear when

266
00:15:17.690 --> 00:15:19.880
you were swimming. And it
just goes right up in

267
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:24.650
your nose. And then it
provides the positive pressure that

268
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:27.170
people need to keep their
soft palate open while they

269
00:15:27.170 --> 00:15:31.460
sleep. But without the whole
giant scary Batman villain machine,

270
00:15:31.460 --> 00:15:34.730
which means people are more
likely to wear them and

271
00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:39.800
then actually sleep and be
healthier and better at life,

272
00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.120
really sleep is good for
you. Yeah. And it's amazing

273
00:15:43.120 --> 00:15:50.320
that little device, if you
look@theirwebsiteatfundairing.com is really very frankly

274
00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.310
spoken at the fact, the
fact goes through like how

275
00:15:54.310 --> 00:15:56.440
they built it and how
long it lasts and how

276
00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:58.420
much it costs. And it
doesn't read like a typical

277
00:15:58.420 --> 00:16:01.240
medical device because I think
that they really are passionate

278
00:16:01.240 --> 00:16:04.240
about it, you know? And
they're like, yeah, you know,

279
00:16:04.270 --> 00:16:06.940
it'll cost about three bucks
and how long will it

280
00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:08.920
last, you know, what lasts
about eight hours? It's just,

281
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.910
it's, it's very like for
us, by us for lack

282
00:16:12.910 --> 00:16:15.400
of a better way of
phrasing it. It is. And

283
00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.950
I think that's another thing
that easy access to social

284
00:16:17.950 --> 00:16:22.840
media has given the ability
for people with chronic illnesses

285
00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:27.190
or disabilities to get together
and form a voice. So,

286
00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:30.460
you know, if I create
an iPhone app and it

287
00:16:30.460 --> 00:16:33.460
doesn't work with voiceover, which
is the iPhone screen reader,

288
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.160
people are going to complain,
they're going to talk about

289
00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.990
it on forums. They're going
to talk about it on

290
00:16:37.990 --> 00:16:42.130
Twitter. They're going to leave
iTunes reviews that are negative

291
00:16:42.130 --> 00:16:45.340
and say, this won't work
for me. And basically having

292
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:48.340
that community or that voice
has made it a lot

293
00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:53.170
easier for people to get
their needs met. Hey folks,

294
00:16:53.170 --> 00:16:55.030
I wanted to take a
moment to tell you about

295
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.660
Reagan and their new product
called pulse. Reagan is an

296
00:16:58.660 --> 00:17:02.020
error and crash reporting software
provider and their new product

297
00:17:02.050 --> 00:17:06.220
pulse to realtime user monitoring
product. It gives you performance

298
00:17:06.220 --> 00:17:10.000
data and user insights. Lets
you understand exactly what's happening

299
00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:12.760
when users interact with your
software. So you're never left

300
00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:16.300
guessing. Reagan provides you with
the answers to your performance

301
00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.960
questions and they've found over
10 billion that's billion with a

302
00:17:19.960 --> 00:17:23.680
B bugs and customer apps
with their crash reporting product.

303
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:27.400
And now Reagan will help
you understand application quality. Like

304
00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:31.180
no one else over 30,000
developers worldwide, can't be wrong.

305
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:33.370
I use Reagan and all
the time and I enjoy

306
00:17:33.380 --> 00:17:35.830
it very much. You can
try it out today with

software quality immediately try Reagan
for free today@reagan.io. People should

309
00:17:48.730 --> 00:17:51.900
definitely take a look at
this particular FAC I love

310
00:17:51.900 --> 00:17:54.150
the way it says, like,
is this device FDA approved?

311
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.360
And they're like, Nope. You
know, and here's why. And

312
00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:58.950
they go through like, well,
you know, maybe we could

313
00:17:58.950 --> 00:18:01.890
do that. Maybe we couldn't.
And they explained their different

314
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:03.330
thinking about it. And then
at the end they're like,

315
00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.730
we'll get there one way
or the other, you know,

316
00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:08.520
and Frank questions, like why
isn't it using a rechargeable

317
00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:10.080
battery, which is one of
the first things that I

318
00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:13.320
was thinking. And they said,
well, because it's only $3.

319
00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.600
If we do use the
small zinc batteries and it'll

320
00:18:18.990 --> 00:18:21.900
be very, very small and
only three bucks. So, you

321
00:18:21.900 --> 00:18:23.610
know, there's a good reason
for all of these different

322
00:18:23.790 --> 00:18:29.070
questions. It seems you were
talking about or cam and

323
00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.240
vision. And then there was
another set of glasses that

324
00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:36.600
corrects for colorblindness. I'm trying
to convince my boss who

325
00:18:36.600 --> 00:18:39.530
is red, green colorblind to
get the Well, these are

326
00:18:39.530 --> 00:18:42.140
much less expensive than the
Orkambi. I think they're in

327
00:18:42.140 --> 00:18:47.960
the $150 range. So pricey
but affordable. And these were

328
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:51.600
actually the subject of a
very, very popular viral video

329
00:18:51.830 --> 00:18:53.750
that floated around the internet.
You may have seen it.

330
00:18:54.200 --> 00:18:56.690
Someone who was red, green
colorblind, a friend bought them

331
00:18:56.690 --> 00:18:59.510
for him and just said
they were sunglasses. And then

332
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:01.580
had him put them, put
them on and filmed him,

333
00:19:01.610 --> 00:19:04.880
seeing colors for the first
time. And it was really

334
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:08.060
neat and inspiring. So yes,
these are in chroma is

335
00:19:08.060 --> 00:19:11.330
the name of the product.
They are just, they're not

336
00:19:11.330 --> 00:19:14.720
electronic in any way. They're
just glasses that use the

337
00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:17.780
magic of optics in a
way. Again, I don't fully

338
00:19:17.780 --> 00:19:21.980
understand to change the way
light comes in and enhance

339
00:19:22.010 --> 00:19:24.800
colors. So people with normal
color vision who put them

340
00:19:24.800 --> 00:19:28.010
on just see really awesome,
bright colors, but people who

341
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:30.380
are color blind, who put
them on, or at least

342
00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:33.320
who are red, green color
blind seek can see red

343
00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.750
and green because of the
way the tones are shifted.

344
00:19:36.140 --> 00:19:40.550
And it's just, it's really
neat. It's useful for things

345
00:19:40.550 --> 00:19:48.290
like reading signs, reading stoplights,
reading, highlighted code syntax, highlighting

346
00:19:48.290 --> 00:19:51.860
for code, you would be
shocked how few colorblind friendly

347
00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:54.440
themes there are for Cibola.
And believe me, I've looked,

348
00:19:55.370 --> 00:19:58.820
but it's also just a
way to have an experience

349
00:19:58.820 --> 00:20:03.050
that you haven't had yet.
Yeah. There's even some testimonials

350
00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:06.380
that say that people with
normal vision enjoy the level

351
00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:09.650
of color saturation that it
offers and that it might,

352
00:20:09.770 --> 00:20:14.180
and this is a very
underscore Italax might benefit one's

353
00:20:14.180 --> 00:20:17.960
mood. If you get down
during the gray, the gray

354
00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:21.020
parts of the wintertime, maybe
turning the saturation up would

355
00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:24.740
make you happier. You know,
I might try that. I

356
00:20:24.740 --> 00:20:29.120
get so sad when it's
winter and I go to

357
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:31.670
work and the sun is
down and I come home

358
00:20:31.670 --> 00:20:35.000
and the sun is down.
Well, you would probably not

359
00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:39.140
do well in Portland because
it is crushingly gray from

360
00:20:39.140 --> 00:20:44.780
about now until next may.
That's the reason that I

361
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:47.590
made a commitment to always
live North of the four

362
00:20:47.590 --> 00:20:50.470
latitude line or sorry, South
of the 34 latitude line

363
00:20:50.830 --> 00:20:53.970
anywhere North it's too dark.
Yep. Yep. We're here at

364
00:20:53.970 --> 00:20:58.380
the 45th parallel and it's
just pretty bad. Yeah. So

365
00:20:58.410 --> 00:21:01.830
in chroma they understand was
another example of something that

366
00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.400
wasn't a plan. They just
kind of stumbled upon it.

367
00:21:06.790 --> 00:21:10.740
Yes. The people who developed
it were doing optics research

368
00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:14.610
on some other topic and
they made these glasses and

369
00:21:14.610 --> 00:21:16.800
they put them on and
the colors were super saturated.

370
00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.200
And then they put them
on a color blind person

371
00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:22.830
and all of a sudden
magic there's a lot of

372
00:21:22.830 --> 00:21:26.250
sort of discovery. And these
things were things that we

373
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:29.100
build for other purposes can
be very helpful for people

374
00:21:29.100 --> 00:21:33.120
with disabilities or chronic illnesses.
And there's another sort of

375
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:36.030
way that that can go
where things that are built

376
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:38.790
for people with disabilities or
chronic illnesses turn out to

377
00:21:38.790 --> 00:21:42.750
be useful to everybody. We
call that in the accessibility

378
00:21:42.750 --> 00:21:46.110
community, the curb cut effect,
curb cuts. So there's tiny

379
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.920
ramps cut into sidewalks that
allow a wheelchair to get

380
00:21:49.920 --> 00:21:53.190
up them. Those are relatively
new in the American landscape.

381
00:21:53.190 --> 00:21:56.640
Those weren't commonly installed until
the Americans with disabilities act.

382
00:21:56.970 --> 00:21:59.130
But now that they're there,
they're really great, right? You

383
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.560
can get your wheel luggage
up at the airport. You

384
00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:04.440
can get your shopping cart
up them. If you're taking

385
00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.020
your shopping cart out of
the grocery store parking lot.

386
00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:09.390
If you're walking with a
small child or a small

387
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.520
dog who has trouble jumping
the curb, they can walk

388
00:22:11.520 --> 00:22:13.980
up them and they turn
out to be really useful

389
00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:19.380
for everybody. One technological example
of that. And I just

390
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.950
discovered that this has been,
they've decided not to market

391
00:22:22.950 --> 00:22:25.560
it in the U S
because of restrictive driving laws,

392
00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:30.270
but it's a device called
the Rigo. It is a

393
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:33.840
smartphone remote that was initially
designed for people who are

394
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.380
blind to attach to a
white cane or a dog

395
00:22:37.380 --> 00:22:41.010
harness, and basically to be
able to control their smartphone

396
00:22:41.010 --> 00:22:44.100
completely hands free so that
they're not trying to both

397
00:22:44.100 --> 00:22:46.590
use a cane and walked
down the road on their

398
00:22:46.590 --> 00:22:51.240
smartphone, which is very unsafe.
And because this device was

399
00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:56.340
built for blind people who
don't have vision it, they

400
00:22:56.340 --> 00:22:57.900
did a lot of testing.
They did a lot of

401
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:01.020
user work and they discovered
it could be used, totally

402
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:05.160
look free. So they, that
could also be really useful

403
00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:08.100
for people who use their
phones while they drive right.

404
00:23:08.670 --> 00:23:12.900
A lot of sort of
hands-free kits or, you know,

405
00:23:13.050 --> 00:23:16.860
no look kits actually, aren't
that good to make them

406
00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:18.930
work with your phone. You
really do have to keep

407
00:23:18.930 --> 00:23:22.110
looking at your phone, but
this device, because it was

408
00:23:22.110 --> 00:23:25.410
built for the blind community
and tested for the blind

409
00:23:25.410 --> 00:23:28.800
community really can be operated
without ever looking at your

410
00:23:28.800 --> 00:23:33.270
phone. So unfortunately the company
has decided not to market

411
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:36.450
it for drivers because of
various legal considerations. But I

412
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.570
still think it's a good
idea if you're going to

413
00:23:39.570 --> 00:23:43.170
use your cell phone anyway,
while you drive. Yeah. You

414
00:23:43.170 --> 00:23:46.670
know, I've actually tried and
probably not good to admit

415
00:23:46.670 --> 00:23:51.170
this, but I've tried using
voiceover on an iPhone to,

416
00:23:51.510 --> 00:23:53.930
to talk to my phone.
I use Siri while I'm

417
00:23:53.930 --> 00:23:57.290
driving. When you plug Siri
in, you can then use

418
00:23:57.290 --> 00:23:59.780
the Hey Siri feature. And
a lot of people don't

419
00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:04.610
realize that, Hey, Siri can
then switch applications. You can

420
00:24:04.610 --> 00:24:06.470
say, Hey Siri, go to
maps. Hey, Siri, go to

421
00:24:06.470 --> 00:24:09.020
mail. You can say, read
this. If you're on a

422
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.830
page or read this mail
or read my texts. I

423
00:24:12.830 --> 00:24:15.470
think that we, as, as
sighted, people could learn a

424
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.460
lot from the way that
people interact with their blind

425
00:24:19.460 --> 00:24:22.520
people interact with their machines,
because I feel like we've

426
00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.850
got like Cortana and Siri
that we can ask individual

427
00:24:25.850 --> 00:24:28.820
questions too. But that's the,
as far as the interaction

428
00:24:28.820 --> 00:24:32.690
really goes, we're not having
long conversations like star Trek

429
00:24:32.720 --> 00:24:38.290
level chats with our computer
about real problems. But you

430
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:43.030
can, because I do accessibility
testing for my day job.

431
00:24:43.060 --> 00:24:45.580
And I'm very familiar with
voiceover. I actually do use

432
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:48.910
it very heavily for a
sighted user. And my favorite

433
00:24:48.910 --> 00:24:51.880
use case is I'll turn
on voiceover and have my

434
00:24:51.880 --> 00:24:54.370
headphones on and turn off
the screen when I'm on

435
00:24:54.370 --> 00:24:56.590
a subway or a bus
and in a crowded area.

436
00:24:56.920 --> 00:24:59.380
And then I can interact
with my phone, but no

437
00:24:59.380 --> 00:25:03.790
one can read over my
shoulder. It's awesome. How long

438
00:25:03.790 --> 00:25:05.890
did that take you to
figure out how long, how

439
00:25:05.890 --> 00:25:07.690
much time would you spend
in voiceover in order to

440
00:25:07.930 --> 00:25:12.310
develop that superpower? It depends.
If you're willing to just

441
00:25:12.310 --> 00:25:15.010
turn off your screen and
flail, you'll learn pretty quickly.

442
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:20.110
If you prefer the less
drowning method, Apple actually has

443
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:23.710
a pretty good voiceover tutorial
that will pop up automatically

444
00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:27.850
when you turn on voiceover.
But if you can print

445
00:25:27.850 --> 00:25:29.410
out a cheat sheet and
look at it, which is

446
00:25:29.410 --> 00:25:31.990
obviously cheating because I'm cited
and I can do that,

447
00:25:32.260 --> 00:25:35.470
that gestures are fairly intuitive
and easy to pick up

448
00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:39.910
a voiceover on a iOS
device is a lot easier

449
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:44.560
to use than a keyboard
based screen reader. Just because

450
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.980
gestures are a little bit
easier to get your head

451
00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:52.780
around. Then the 75,000 keyboard
combinations. You, you need to

452
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:54.580
make a desktop screen where
you get to work well.

453
00:25:54.730 --> 00:25:59.410
So I'd say, yeah, It
really is surprisingly, it's surprisingly

454
00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:02.620
usable. I think for, for
a, for a touch, you

455
00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:04.300
know, for a black slate
that you can only touch,

456
00:26:04.330 --> 00:26:06.790
you would not expect an
iPhone to be a blind

457
00:26:06.790 --> 00:26:09.850
friendly device, but it really
is very, Very good. It

458
00:26:09.850 --> 00:26:13.330
is very good. And I'm
slightly prejudiced in favor of

459
00:26:13.330 --> 00:26:15.820
it. I think that the
voiceover screen reader is a

460
00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:18.550
lot better than the screen
reader that's built into Android

461
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:21.790
devices. Although the Android one
is improving. And that is

462
00:26:21.790 --> 00:26:24.970
the reason why I own
an iPhone, even though I

463
00:26:24.970 --> 00:26:28.360
don't have any other Apple
devices and I'm otherwise a

464
00:26:28.690 --> 00:26:31.630
windows user and a sort
of natural audience for the

465
00:26:31.630 --> 00:26:34.600
Android because I use the
screen reader. And because the

466
00:26:34.600 --> 00:26:36.520
Apple one is so much
better, I've stuck with an

467
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.610
iOS phone. Interesting. Well, now
you're going to make me

468
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:42.250
rediscover voiceover and spend more
time trying that. And I

469
00:26:42.250 --> 00:26:45.660
think that anyone who's in
assistive technologies who is able

470
00:26:45.660 --> 00:26:49.620
bodied or not, not disabled
in the way that would

471
00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:52.530
require to you to use
a certain feature, should try

472
00:26:52.530 --> 00:26:55.860
those features. If you are
cited, try using a machine,

473
00:26:56.070 --> 00:27:00.990
whether it be a phone
or computer with, without the

474
00:27:00.990 --> 00:27:02.760
thing that you're used to
like turn off the monitor,

475
00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:06.240
just use your headphones to
explore these different things. Even

476
00:27:06.240 --> 00:27:09.230
though you, you have all
your faculties, It's a great

477
00:27:09.230 --> 00:27:13.100
use, a another great assistive
technology feature that's built into

478
00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.970
iOS devices and possibly an
Android as well is I

479
00:27:16.970 --> 00:27:20.330
keep my phone on vibrate
pretty much all of the

480
00:27:20.330 --> 00:27:25.190
time. And in the iOS
accessibility settings, you can set

481
00:27:25.190 --> 00:27:29.060
custom vibration patterns to be
used as ringtones and text

482
00:27:29.060 --> 00:27:33.050
notifications. So I can, I
also know Morse code. So

483
00:27:33.050 --> 00:27:35.720
I basically set up custom
notifications for the people who

484
00:27:35.720 --> 00:27:38.600
call or text me most
where it taps out in

485
00:27:38.600 --> 00:27:41.030
Morse code their name, and
then I can have my

486
00:27:41.030 --> 00:27:43.340
phone in my pocket. And
I could know if the

487
00:27:43.340 --> 00:27:45.590
person calling me is my
fiance and I should really

488
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:47.510
answer, or if it's a
stranger and I don't even

489
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.900
bother have deficient out. That
is cool. So you have

490
00:27:50.930 --> 00:27:54.770
made the custom tap for
a person, the custom vibration

491
00:27:54.770 --> 00:27:56.870
for a person, be the
Morse code of like a

492
00:27:56.870 --> 00:28:00.290
couple of their initials or
something. Exactly. If you don't

493
00:28:00.290 --> 00:28:02.750
know Morse code, which is
okay, then you can use

494
00:28:02.750 --> 00:28:05.690
any custom tapping pattern. That
makes sense to you. You

495
00:28:05.690 --> 00:28:07.910
have to just pause for
a second because I think,

496
00:28:07.910 --> 00:28:09.740
and I think that the
audience should pause as well

497
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:12.500
to just give you the,
the nerd slow clap of

498
00:28:12.500 --> 00:28:17.810
the week. Cause that is
awesome. Seriously. Like, you know,

499
00:28:17.810 --> 00:28:21.650
it's awesome. It's a really,
that's a really cool life

500
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:23.210
hack. I like that. I
need to learn more as

501
00:28:23.450 --> 00:28:27.050
down to make that more
feasible for me though. One

502
00:28:27.050 --> 00:28:30.230
of my very favorite sort
of party tricks is to

503
00:28:30.230 --> 00:28:33.980
talk to people about their
frustrations with technology, and then

504
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:36.770
tell them how they could
be using the accessibility features.

505
00:28:36.770 --> 00:28:39.080
They didn't know existed and
their device to make their

506
00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.400
device better. I don't know
if it's as fun for

507
00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.590
other people as it is
for me, but I really

508
00:28:45.590 --> 00:28:51.230
enjoy it. Here's a possible
plug for a product that

509
00:28:51.230 --> 00:28:54.740
I work on a little
startup that a couple of

510
00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:57.380
people have used in an
accessibility context cause you're a

511
00:28:57.380 --> 00:29:00.380
windows user and an iPhone
user. My buddy, Greg and

512
00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:03.650
I wrote an application called
my echo that basically takes

513
00:29:03.650 --> 00:29:06.530
the dictation from Siri, which
is excellent. Especially if you're

514
00:29:06.530 --> 00:29:11.570
dictating an entire paragraph and
brings it into windows. So

515
00:29:11.570 --> 00:29:14.900
if you're sitting in word
or Excel or, or outlook

516
00:29:14.930 --> 00:29:17.780
or Gmail, you can talk
on your iPhone, it goes

517
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:19.430
up to the cloud and
then back and then paste

518
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.490
it into whatever you're doing.
And this has been huge

519
00:29:22.490 --> 00:29:24.770
for accessibility, even though that's
not who we designed it

520
00:29:24.770 --> 00:29:29.480
for. That is dragon. Naturally
speaking is the most common

521
00:29:29.480 --> 00:29:32.570
program used for that, but
it's an expensive program. So

522
00:29:32.570 --> 00:29:35.180
the licenses cost a few
hundred dollars. So being able

523
00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:38.660
to have a hack like
that is really useful. I

524
00:29:38.660 --> 00:29:41.710
have access to dragon because
my employer bought it for

525
00:29:41.710 --> 00:29:46.140
me, but That's exactly right.
Being able to do this

526
00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:48.720
for two bucks or three
bucks. But also if you

527
00:29:48.720 --> 00:29:51.000
use Siri on a regular
basis, being able to choose,

528
00:29:51.330 --> 00:29:52.950
and that gets to the
larger point that you were

529
00:29:52.950 --> 00:29:55.560
making earlier about how we
can plug all these things

530
00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.900
together. Like we don't have
to wait for a big

531
00:29:57.900 --> 00:30:00.180
corporation to do it. We
can say, Oh, I like

532
00:30:00.180 --> 00:30:01.830
that service. And I like
this here, and I'm going

533
00:30:01.830 --> 00:30:06.150
to make my own hack.
Exactly. And there's a big

534
00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:09.150
wide world of people out
there who will help you

535
00:30:09.150 --> 00:30:13.050
test, who are very excited
about technology that helps them

536
00:30:13.470 --> 00:30:15.960
build the world. So if
you are working on an

537
00:30:15.960 --> 00:30:18.450
app and you're looking for
blind users to test to

538
00:30:18.450 --> 00:30:21.390
see if it works with
voiceover, go on Twitter and

539
00:30:21.390 --> 00:30:25.410
ask. There's so many people
who are so enthusiastic about

540
00:30:25.410 --> 00:30:28.440
helping you out with testing,
with code, with all these

541
00:30:28.440 --> 00:30:33.870
things, because these technologies help
widen their world. Absolutely. And

542
00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.300
I've even found that Twitter
is kind of a great

543
00:30:36.330 --> 00:30:39.240
equalizer as well. You know,
I've talked to lots of

544
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.500
people on Twitter and there's
always someone out there who

545
00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:46.050
either is interested in the
topic that you're interested in

546
00:30:46.050 --> 00:30:49.080
or has the, the disability
or the disease or the

547
00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.000
condition that you're interested in.
And then you can connect

548
00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:55.110
with that community and, and
move the ball forward. Exactly.

549
00:30:55.110 --> 00:30:57.960
And you will not find
a more enthusiastic group of

550
00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:02.670
Twitter evangelists out there than
the disability community. If they

551
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:06.060
find something that works, especially
if you, as a developer

552
00:31:06.060 --> 00:31:08.910
or an open source leader
are willing to put in

553
00:31:08.910 --> 00:31:12.750
the effort, then they will
tell absolutely everybody they know.

554
00:31:14.010 --> 00:31:17.130
Very cool. Well, I think
that you, you definitely sold

555
00:31:17.130 --> 00:31:21.060
me on the idea that
accessible design is, is, is

556
00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:25.050
fun. You know, it's not
a boring obligation Except maybe

557
00:31:25.050 --> 00:31:27.750
for form labels. I will
admit those are probably not

558
00:31:27.750 --> 00:31:29.640
as fun as I think
they are. Oh, I'll give

559
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:32.070
you that. Putting all texts
on your pictures always sucks,

560
00:31:32.430 --> 00:31:35.640
but we do it because
we should. But the, the

561
00:31:35.640 --> 00:31:38.070
devices that one can create
an access right now to

562
00:31:38.070 --> 00:31:41.490
make life easier are pretty
amazing. It'll be, it'd be

563
00:31:41.490 --> 00:31:43.200
fun to follow up in
a year or two and

564
00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:45.090
see what else is going
on in this space of

565
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:49.740
non-web assistive technologies. I will
reach out back out to

566
00:31:49.740 --> 00:31:52.110
you when I find something
really cool. Very cool. Well,

567
00:31:52.110 --> 00:31:54.240
thank you so much, Sylvia
Richardson for chatting with me

568
00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.610
today. All right. And thank
you for having me as

569
00:31:56.610 --> 00:31:59.610
a guest. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

570
00:31:59.610 --> 00:32:00.750
we'll see you again next
week.
