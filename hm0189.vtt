And it's another episode of

8
00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.970
Hansel minutes, and I'm here

11
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:02.630
again next week. We're going
to do a focus show

12
00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:04.250
here, Richard. We're not just
going to hang out and

13
00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:06.560
chat. And this is where
we're on a mission. We're

14
00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.080
on a mission, my friend,
because it's a, it's a,

15
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:12.020
what is this? Now? It's
black Sunday, black Saturday, black

16
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:17.540
Friday. It's a Saturday. And
the day after black Friday,

17
00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.550
black Friday, of course is
the day that everyone camps

18
00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:21.110
out at best buy to
get a laptop for a

19
00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:24.380
hundred dollars. I went to
best buy Richard and I

20
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:26.000
went at 10 in the
evening to see if I

21
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:27.680
could get that laptop. I
went at 10 in the

22
00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:30.580
evening, the night before, there
were 150 people in line

23
00:01:30.590 --> 00:01:35.540
intense already, already. So I
went home. That's crazy. This

24
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.530
episode of Hansel minutes is
the geek gadget gift guide

25
00:01:40.010 --> 00:01:43.370
episode. Say that three times
fast. And I said, who

26
00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:45.020
better than Richard to come
and talk to me about

27
00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.120
geek gadgets. We've got a
list of some gadgets here

28
00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:50.060
that we think are the
ones for geeks. If you're

29
00:01:50.060 --> 00:01:53.300
a geek and you want
to gadget find your spouse

30
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:56.000
or significant other or domestic
partner and let them listen

31
00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.120
to this show, maybe you'll
get some cool stuff. That's

32
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.520
what we're here for. We
are here. So, Richard, what

33
00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.440
is your first, your first
item on the geek gadget

34
00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.900
gift guide list? Well, my
first gadget would be the

35
00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:10.280
PDC laptop. Yes. Laptop that
we did not get that's

36
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.930
right. The one that you
didn't get in, I did

37
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.330
get, you know, so are
you giving it to me

38
00:02:14.330 --> 00:02:16.370
for Christmas? I'm not, but
it would be nice if

39
00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.020
people did give it to
me for Christmas, but I

40
00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:22.190
went out looking for the
equivalent machine. Excellent. And I

41
00:02:22.190 --> 00:02:26.390
found one scandalous. I know
I'm amazing because of course

42
00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.420
the Acer makes this machine
that they give out a

43
00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.580
PVC, but it's a custom
made machine. They're not making

44
00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:34.880
any more. They are yet.
But if you want it

45
00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.440
to go out now, let's
just talk about the basic

46
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:40.220
specs of this machine. Dual
core up to eight gigs

47
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:45.110
of Ram running windows seven
64 bit, right dual touch.

48
00:02:45.410 --> 00:02:48.800
And it's a convertible tablet.
Okay. And it's got one

49
00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:51.770
and mounting for one hard
drive at Hewlett. Packard makes

50
00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:55.880
a machine called the media
smart. This is not the

51
00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.090
media smart that I'm used
to the media smart home.

52
00:03:00.190 --> 00:03:03.880
No, it's not. This is
their tablet. And so it's

53
00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:07.330
actually a media smart tablet
and it is essentially the

54
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:10.690
same machine. The difference being
that you can actually dress

55
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:12.400
this one up so you
can actually buy it with

56
00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:14.860
more memory in it. You
can put an SSD into

57
00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.380
it. You can put a
larger processor into it. So

58
00:03:17.380 --> 00:03:20.560
you can spend anywhere between
about $700 up to about

59
00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:23.710
$1,500 on one of these
machines. But if you're after

60
00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.790
one of these PDC tablet
machines, okay, HP makes your

61
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:32.050
closest equivalent today. $700 bare
bones dressed-up then you'll spend.

62
00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:34.800
Wow, well that's about how
much they said it was

63
00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:38.250
worth six, $700. Right? Very
cool. So that's the HP

64
00:03:38.250 --> 00:03:42.270
media smart. You're sure about
that smart tablet, not the

65
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:44.250
media smart homes. Although that
home server would be a

66
00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.680
lovely gift as well for
Christmas, for a geek, The

67
00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:50.940
actual model number is T
Z. Okay. We'll have links

68
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:52.320
for all of these on
the Le on the show

69
00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:54.180
links. I'll go in church
for each of these. If

70
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:56.880
you are unable to Google
with Bing, I will find

71
00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.120
them for you. Okay. So
there's one. So that's a

72
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.600
little spending. My first item
is the, the chumby, the

73
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:05.820
chumby is actually an older
item from a while back.

74
00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:09.150
This is like a little
tiny fuzzy alarm clock with

75
00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:11.450
a little Linux machine in
it. And they just, it

76
00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:13.920
was about $200 and it
was cute. And when I

77
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:17.010
say fuzzy, I mean, it
was literally covered in suede,

78
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.620
but now they just came
out with one that is

79
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:22.320
not covered in suede. And
for that, you can get

80
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.840
called the chumby one and
it's a hundred bucks, much

81
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.220
more accessible. It's got a
little four inch touchscreen and

82
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:30.990
it looks like a funny
little square. It look, you

83
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:32.580
know, it looks like it
looks like an old style

84
00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.060
GPS with the kind of
CRT curved back. Yeah. But

85
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:38.730
it's a widget machine. It's
literally something that you can

86
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:42.180
download widgets to. And it's
an open SDK. So you

87
00:04:42.180 --> 00:04:44.580
can put anything you want
on it. And there's a,

88
00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:46.380
you can have it be
a Twitter client. It can

89
00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:49.260
show whether it can play
little, little animations and stuff.

90
00:04:49.290 --> 00:04:52.260
It's a, a little SDK
kind of in your pocket,

91
00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:54.570
but it's, it's kind of
something that you would sit

92
00:04:54.570 --> 00:04:58.120
on your, on your nightstand.
And this is also one

93
00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.300
of the chumby. One is
different from the original chumby

94
00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:02.310
in that it has a
battery. So then it can

95
00:05:02.310 --> 00:05:06.450
be untethered and I've seen
people make continuous integration server

96
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:10.530
monitors out of it. You
know, baby monitors. It's really

97
00:05:10.530 --> 00:05:13.620
anything you want. It's a
tiny computer. So chumby one

98
00:05:13.620 --> 00:05:17.520
99 bucks. Nice. Okay. What
do you, Yeah, for me,

99
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.480
I'll stick on the, well,
you know what? Let's just

100
00:05:21.480 --> 00:05:23.880
pick an easy one. I
think 2010 is going to

101
00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.060
be the year of the
ebook. Really? That is pretty

102
00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.830
easy. That's pretty obvious. Do
you think it could happen

103
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:32.760
now? I think we're there.
And honestly, I think 2012

104
00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:34.650
will be the year where
they give eBooks books away

105
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:36.810
with a subscription to the
wall street journal or something

106
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.240
of the equivalent. But I
think right now between the

107
00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.930
Kindle and Sony easy book,
there's really no excuse not

108
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:45.600
to own an ebook. Everything.
Is there, Look that everyone's

109
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.820
talking about the new book
from Barnes and noble. Yeah,

110
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.100
Sure. That'll be great when
we actually can lay our

111
00:05:50.100 --> 00:05:52.500
hands on one. I mean,
I'm talking about what can

112
00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.080
you get today? That'll be
in the stocking for sure.

113
00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.760
You know, and I have
a Kindle and I've, I've

114
00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:00.560
had a Kindle DX. I
had an original Kindle. I've

115
00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:03.530
got a Kindle too. Right
now. They just released a

116
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:06.380
new firmware like two days
ago. And now suddenly my

117
00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:10.160
Kindle is a very competent
PDF reader, just updated free

118
00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:12.140
software. And suddenly I have
a PDF reader that I

119
00:06:12.140 --> 00:06:16.370
didn't have before. Nice. So
that right there for me

120
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:19.070
makes the Kindle so much
more useful that I can

121
00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:22.520
now drop PDFs on, on
it that I maybe wouldn't

122
00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.220
have. I could take word
documents, save them as PDF

123
00:06:25.220 --> 00:06:27.620
directly from word and just
plug it in, drop them

124
00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:30.440
on the device. There's no
conversion. It's a native PDF

125
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:33.740
reader. This is something that
the Kendall DX had. Now

126
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.080
the Kendall two has it
for me that makes the

127
00:06:36.080 --> 00:06:38.960
Kindle a winner over the
Sony. But the people that

128
00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:42.020
I talk to are, you
know, who were into eBooks

129
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:45.320
say that they don't like
that Kendall is tied to

130
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:48.710
Amazon while Sony is slightly
tied to Sony, but really

131
00:06:48.710 --> 00:06:51.260
more of an open reader
because it supports the pub

132
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:53.470
format. But I think what
I like about the Kindle

133
00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.070
also is that your, your
ebook has an email address.

134
00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.200
So I've seen a guy
take a whole bunch of

135
00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:01.210
documents corner of all the
PDF and then mail them

136
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.870
to his Kindle. Yeah. Well
actually, if, if you don't

137
00:07:04.870 --> 00:07:07.030
have them as PDFs, they'll,
they'll charge you 10 cents and

138
00:07:07.030 --> 00:07:09.610
convert them on their own
now. So you just send

139
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:11.500
a, send a word doc
and it'll just show up.

140
00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:14.830
Now it doesn't mean it'll
look good. But so, I

141
00:07:14.830 --> 00:07:16.060
mean, if you really want
it to look nice, it

142
00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.580
needs to be a PDF.
But if you email anything

143
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:20.920
to your Kindle, it'll just
show up. It's like 10 cents.

144
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:24.700
It's fantastic. I don't mind
that the Kindle is a

145
00:07:24.910 --> 00:07:28.090
direct line from Jeff Bezos, his
wallet into my wallet. Right.

146
00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.430
I don't mind. And I
also like that if you

147
00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:32.830
lose it or you torch
it or you goof it

148
00:07:32.830 --> 00:07:34.960
up or you drop it
or whatever, they're all in

149
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:38.650
the cloud. And you know,
everybody trusts Amazon's cloud I've.

150
00:07:38.670 --> 00:07:40.420
I also liked that if
you have an iPhone or

151
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:43.840
an iPod touch or now
Kindle on the PC, the

152
00:07:43.840 --> 00:07:46.630
page that you're on is
synchronized between all of those

153
00:07:46.630 --> 00:07:49.000
devices. So I can read
it Well, my PC for

154
00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.800
awhile. And then when I
go back to my Kindle

155
00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:54.790
itself, it's Get on a
plane, read for awhile, come

156
00:07:54.790 --> 00:07:57.190
back, pick it up exactly
where you left off. Awesome.

157
00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.860
Definitely ebook. I have the
Kindle on my list as

158
00:07:59.860 --> 00:08:01.900
well. So I think we
both agree that you can't

159
00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:03.070
go wrong with the Kindle
and it's down to like

160
00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:06.850
200 bucks now. Yeah. Which
means that $99 is coming

161
00:08:06.850 --> 00:08:09.760
soon. The one I'm after
now is the international edition,

162
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:13.840
where for your, your purchase
price, it works on everybody's

163
00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:17.290
three G network, Right? Although
if you, if you're not

164
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:18.970
on your home three G
network, you will pay a

165
00:08:18.970 --> 00:08:23.110
dollar or so transport fee,
right. For, for visiting another

166
00:08:23.110 --> 00:08:26.890
network. So for, and the
internet, the international coverage map

167
00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:31.480
is up on the amazon.com/kindle
website, but it doesn't work

168
00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.240
exactly everywhere. I mean, most
of Europe, most of Western

169
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.670
Europe, most of Asia, I
think there's some trouble in

170
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:39.640
Australia though. Either. I've heard
that it's not really good

171
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:42.010
coverage down there. Beats the
heck out of not working

172
00:08:42.010 --> 00:08:44.860
at all. And considering you
live in Canadia or whatever

173
00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:47.290
that is, how was your
Canadian Thanksgiving? Do you guys

174
00:08:47.290 --> 00:08:49.270
have, thanks for that at
all. We did. We did

175
00:08:49.270 --> 00:08:50.830
it a month earlier than
you. We had more to

176
00:08:50.830 --> 00:08:55.210
be thankful for. That's true
being, being from Canada and,

177
00:08:55.230 --> 00:09:00.060
and all. Okay. So I
talked a little bit about

178
00:09:00.060 --> 00:09:01.590
this in my gadget show,
but I still think that

179
00:09:01.590 --> 00:09:03.180
this is a great device
and I'm still using it.

180
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:07.740
Now. This is the IMO
USB monitor. This is a

181
00:09:07.770 --> 00:09:10.080
great little monitor. I'm actually
holding it here. It's a

182
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:15.090
seven inch monitor. There's a
touchscreen version. The one I've

183
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.610
got also has a pivot.
It's got a brightness control

184
00:09:17.610 --> 00:09:19.410
and it's just a it's,
it's crazy. It's a, it's

185
00:09:19.410 --> 00:09:23.160
a seven inch USB monitor.
I T I used to

186
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.410
have four monitors. I took
one of them and I

187
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:27.960
put it into my arcade
machine and I've always wanted

188
00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.720
that extra monitor. And I
ended up putting a tweet

189
00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:33.330
deck down on this monitor.
So this has been my,

190
00:09:34.350 --> 00:09:36.840
my not quite a monitor
monitor. I'll put down tweet

191
00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:40.320
deck or put my calendar
or notes, show notes for

192
00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:44.790
doing a show. And recently,
since I haven't rebooted my

193
00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:46.830
windows seven machine in so
many months, this has been

194
00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:51.210
the monitor where I put
the restart. Now postpone dialogue.

195
00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.640
It's been down there for,
it's been down there for

196
00:09:53.640 --> 00:09:56.460
a month or two now
because I, my computer desperately

197
00:09:56.460 --> 00:09:58.290
wants to restart and I
really don't want it to,

198
00:09:58.710 --> 00:10:01.940
so this monitor is dedicated
to that dialogue box. Yeah.

199
00:10:01.940 --> 00:10:04.460
This is a little, it's
like 800 by four 80.

200
00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:07.400
It's It's big. Yeah. It's
800 bucks. That's about right.

201
00:10:07.400 --> 00:10:09.800
Actually 800 by four 80.
It's quite small, but what's

202
00:10:09.800 --> 00:10:11.540
nice about it is that
that happens to be the

203
00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:17.150
size of a, a hulu.com
video. And it's also a

204
00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:19.310
16 by nine monitor. As
you point out, it's a,

205
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:23.060
it's got that nice resolution
that is appropriate for movies.

206
00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:26.060
So I put, I put
DVDs down there and watch

207
00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:29.210
them well, while doing email,
it's just perfect. It fits

208
00:10:29.210 --> 00:10:32.210
nicely underneath your, your giant
monitor. So I've got this

209
00:10:32.210 --> 00:10:34.550
like 24 inch and then
I've got the little seven

210
00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.290
inch right below it. Nice.
And it's like a hundred

211
00:10:36.290 --> 00:10:39.560
bucks or something. It's just
a fantastic little device. That's

212
00:10:39.560 --> 00:10:44.120
cool. It is. Yeah. And
inexpensive too. I'm just looking

213
00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:47.180
online here. $130 retail. Well,
yeah. And there's also a

214
00:10:47.180 --> 00:10:51.230
touch one too. Wow. Yeah.
Yeah. I hear that. There's

215
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:53.600
talk about the touch working
with windows seven. So it

216
00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.130
could be a really cheap
way to at least start

217
00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:58.850
fooling around with the touch
stuff. Yeah. And it's about

218
00:10:58.850 --> 00:11:02.450
time. People started selling independent
touch monitors, so that that's

219
00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:03.890
been annoying to me. I
don't want to buy your

220
00:11:03.890 --> 00:11:05.620
computer. I just want to
buy a monitor. We touch.

221
00:11:06.530 --> 00:11:09.050
Yeah, exactly. I don't want
a kitchen PC from HP.

222
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:11.000
I just want the, you
know, as soon as Dell

223
00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.900
sells the 24 inch, nice
quality Dell with touch, it's

224
00:11:14.900 --> 00:11:16.280
all on. You know what
I mean? It's on man.

225
00:11:16.730 --> 00:11:19.490
I'm so I'm so getting
that that'll be that. Totally.

226
00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.580
All right. Should we keep
moving on? Yes, sir. What

227
00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:24.830
do you got for Getting
a little out of the

228
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:28.880
computer toys, but still gadget
stuff? The Tom, Tom go

229
00:11:28.890 --> 00:11:32.240
seven 40. Okay. This is
a GPS from Tom, Tom.

230
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:35.180
That's right. And why is
this better than average GPS

231
00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:37.040
I can get? Well, the
main thing, This one is

232
00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:41.810
that they finally gone with
the built in live service.

233
00:11:41.810 --> 00:11:43.910
So you don't need to
have a Bluetooth connection to

234
00:11:43.910 --> 00:11:45.530
your cell phone for data
or any of those sorts

235
00:11:45.530 --> 00:11:48.170
of things. It's all in
one. So it has your

236
00:11:48.590 --> 00:11:51.350
traffic data for your local
area, right on the map.

237
00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.960
Okay. So what is, what
is getting it from, is

238
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:58.630
it, is it wireless? Is
it cell phone? Where's the

239
00:11:58.630 --> 00:12:01.110
data It's from a three
G system. So you do

240
00:12:01.110 --> 00:12:03.330
have to eventually usually comes
with a few months where

241
00:12:03.330 --> 00:12:06.930
the subscription, you do eventually
have to buy it. But

242
00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:12.300
the reality is these navigation,
every, a navigation systems are

243
00:12:12.300 --> 00:12:14.430
now cheap. So you might
as well have one. It

244
00:12:14.430 --> 00:12:18.090
makes your life a lot
better. And then when you,

245
00:12:18.090 --> 00:12:20.550
once you throw in the
traffic data, these things come

246
00:12:20.550 --> 00:12:23.040
incredibly compelling. Now you use
it every time I'm even

247
00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:26.100
using it to go home.
Right. I know where home

248
00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:27.930
is, but the fact that
it'll tell me, don't take

249
00:12:27.930 --> 00:12:30.270
your usual route, go this
way because of this accident,

250
00:12:30.570 --> 00:12:35.280
that's really useful stuff. So
GPS is, is moving away

251
00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:37.800
from just finding a way
to get somewhere and now

252
00:12:37.830 --> 00:12:40.350
telling you the status of
the, kind of the direction

253
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.970
Yeah. Of the route that
you're on. Huh? Yeah. I'm

254
00:12:44.970 --> 00:12:47.520
not a Tom Tom fan.
I am a, a Garmin

255
00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:51.930
NUVI fan. And I've know
that the NUVI has one,

256
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:55.800
I think for $130. Now
that includes a lifetime subscription.

257
00:12:56.370 --> 00:12:58.830
Nice for, for the live
traffic. And I don't know

258
00:12:58.830 --> 00:13:01.050
where they're getting that from
someone implied that it might

259
00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:03.690
be from a back channel
on FM radio. So it

260
00:13:03.690 --> 00:13:05.400
may only work in the
U S but it might

261
00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:08.130
also be 3g. I'm not
sure Different ways for that

262
00:13:08.130 --> 00:13:10.710
to work too. I've built
into my car. I have

263
00:13:10.710 --> 00:13:14.670
one that comes in through
XM radio. Oh, really? You

264
00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:18.600
know that, I definitely think
that the next step for

265
00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:22.950
GPS is the live traffic
update as well as automatically

266
00:13:22.980 --> 00:13:25.710
updating themselves because I've got
a new V that I

267
00:13:25.710 --> 00:13:32.670
bought four years ago. And
unfortunately it's garbage because it

268
00:13:32.670 --> 00:13:37.200
was a $600, like four
or five years ago. And

269
00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:42.930
now it's now the equivalent
is $99. Okay. But if

270
00:13:42.930 --> 00:13:45.510
I want to buy a
new map, it's $199. Yeah.

271
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.600
That's an interesting business. And
all the while you've got,

272
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:52.050
you know, stuff from Google
where it's going to be

273
00:13:52.050 --> 00:13:54.870
free, you can plug it
into your Android phone. I

274
00:13:54.870 --> 00:13:57.480
think that the GPS people
are really panicking. And I,

275
00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:02.520
so I suspect that next
Christmas GPS is, are going

276
00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:04.500
to be a whole other
universe. It's going to be

277
00:14:04.860 --> 00:14:07.740
live connection, live updating over
the web free maps. I

278
00:14:07.740 --> 00:14:10.170
mean, they're, they're getting there,
they're getting their lunch eaten

279
00:14:10.170 --> 00:14:12.120
by Google and they need
to step up or they're

280
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.610
in trouble. Well, and you've
got this battle back and

281
00:14:14.610 --> 00:14:17.160
forth between the dedicated device
and the all in one

282
00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:20.670
device. Your iPhone can do
everything except that if you

283
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:23.310
try and make it, do
everything, your battery life's like

284
00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:26.820
an hour. So, you know,
the D that's why I

285
00:14:26.820 --> 00:14:29.670
still have a dedicated MP3
player. And I, and I

286
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.310
still have a dedicated GPS
because I need those things

287
00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:34.590
to work for the tasks
that they doing and stay

288
00:14:34.590 --> 00:14:37.500
out of the way on
my phone. Hey, everybody, this

289
00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.540
is Scott coming at you
from another place in time.

290
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:42.570
No doubt. You probably bumped
into testing tasks now, and

291
00:14:42.570 --> 00:14:45.420
then, and your work and,
you know, writing functional tests

292
00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.460
is probably not your favorite
thing. It's kind of difficult.

293
00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:50.130
It takes time and the
results can be dubious. We

294
00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:53.030
don't get ready to start
tests. Thanks to Tellerik with

295
00:14:53.030 --> 00:14:57.110
the, the new webinar testing
framework. Building web automation test

296
00:14:57.110 --> 00:15:00.590
is a breeze. You've got
code automation with advanced asp.net

297
00:15:00.620 --> 00:15:02.930
Ajax, and several light applications.
You can write a single

298
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:06.890
test, have it executed against
multiple browsers at once. You'd

299
00:15:06.890 --> 00:15:09.980
benefit from a rich API
there's link support integration with

300
00:15:10.010 --> 00:15:13.340
visual studio, unit testing, also
end unit X unit and

301
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.640
MBA unit, not to mention
the free rappers for Telerik

302
00:15:16.640 --> 00:15:19.790
rad controls for ESPN and
Ajax, and several light, all

303
00:15:19.790 --> 00:15:23.090
shipping with Telerik's new testing
tool. One of the best

304
00:15:23.090 --> 00:15:26.180
features, the webinar testing framework,
which is developed by art

305
00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:30.380
of test is it's absolutely
free. Freddie got hooked on

306
00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:33.170
web testing framework, start using
it right away, go to

307
00:15:33.170 --> 00:15:37.730
tellerik.com for more info. Thanks
a lot. I wish that

308
00:15:37.730 --> 00:15:41.150
I could update my, the
GPS software or use the

309
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.330
monitor in my car. I've
got a 2007 Mazda that

310
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:46.820
has a very nice bright
screen, except the software that

311
00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:51.200
runs the GPS is crap.
And I feel uncomfortable putting

312
00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:53.390
in a aftermarket GPS. Cause
then I say, well, what's

313
00:15:53.390 --> 00:15:56.900
this giant seven inch screen
for them. Yeah. You know,

314
00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:59.330
so it's, it's a shame,
but if you don't have

315
00:15:59.330 --> 00:16:01.550
a GPS, this is definitely
the time to buy one.

316
00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:03.850
I think we can both
agree on that For sure.

317
00:16:03.910 --> 00:16:07.540
Yeah. They, these are mature
products now. Yeah, definitely. So,

318
00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.940
so next on my list
is something that I actually,

319
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:12.340
I don't own, but I've
heard so many nice things

320
00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:16.900
about it. It's the de-link
<inaudible> wireless pocket router. This

321
00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:19.960
is a couple of years
old now, but it's about

322
00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.150
40 bucks now. And this
was 150 at one time.

323
00:16:22.150 --> 00:16:25.120
And now it's about $47.
This is a portable pocket

324
00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:27.430
router. Now you've used this
before. Have you not? I

325
00:16:27.430 --> 00:16:31.060
just cooked another one. They,
I use where I usually,

326
00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.190
I carry one with me
all the time, except when

327
00:16:33.190 --> 00:16:37.330
they're fried a, my laptop
bag and the main place

328
00:16:37.330 --> 00:16:39.280
that I use it more
than anything is in hotels.

329
00:16:39.730 --> 00:16:43.510
Cause it variably, I've got
somebody, Oh, you know, Carl's

330
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.030
in the room with me
or my wife's there or

331
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.190
somebody and we all want
to be on internet at

332
00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:51.130
once. So just that automatic
reflex to plug into the

333
00:16:51.130 --> 00:16:54.490
ethernet connection of the hotel
and share it over a,

334
00:16:54.510 --> 00:16:58.180
a, a, a wifi connection.
It's just incredibly useful. The

335
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.790
main thing I like about
this particular one, the seven

336
00:17:00.790 --> 00:17:04.150
30 is that you can,
there's a power cable that

337
00:17:04.150 --> 00:17:05.920
comes with it, that doesn't
plug into the wall. It

338
00:17:05.920 --> 00:17:09.550
plugs into a USB port.
And then I also carry

339
00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:13.840
a on ACD USB converter,
which I can use for

340
00:17:13.840 --> 00:17:16.840
charging anything that'll charge off
USB. So the combination of

341
00:17:16.840 --> 00:17:19.600
that device and this, I
can have this little self

342
00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:24.650
contained wifi node without carrying
the wall wart and, and

343
00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:28.510
anybody can access it. Now,
is this, is this something

344
00:17:28.510 --> 00:17:30.340
that is only about hotels
or what I use this

345
00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:33.280
at, at Starbucks as well?
I suppose you could use

346
00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.530
it at Starbucks. But my
experience with Starbucks is that,

347
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:37.090
you know, if you've got
a card you can already

348
00:17:37.090 --> 00:17:39.040
get on there, their service.
So it's just not that

349
00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.950
big a deal. The main
thing with this one is

350
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.410
you could switch it into
different modes, right? So one

351
00:17:44.410 --> 00:17:46.930
mode is as a Nat
router access point. That's the

352
00:17:46.930 --> 00:17:50.190
one for the, for the,
the hotel, but you need

353
00:17:50.190 --> 00:17:52.170
to have an ethernet cable
that has internet on it

354
00:17:52.170 --> 00:17:55.650
to plug into it. Right.
But you can also flip

355
00:17:55.650 --> 00:17:57.270
this around. So if I
had a device at an

356
00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:00.150
ethernet port, but didn't have
wifi, I can use this

357
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.180
as a wifi client, so
it can connect a device

358
00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:06.620
to wifi. I was just,
it's just hard to set

359
00:18:06.620 --> 00:18:09.860
up. It's, it's a little
Fiddly because there's only one

360
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.110
ethernet port on it. So
you've got to plug into

361
00:18:12.110 --> 00:18:13.880
it to come to configure
it, or you can configure

362
00:18:13.880 --> 00:18:15.440
it over the wireless, but
you can get it into

363
00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.240
a state where you don't
know where it is and

364
00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.790
you basically have to reset
it and reconfigure it. But

365
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.820
it's the price of being
that small. Also the antenna

366
00:18:22.820 --> 00:18:24.890
on it is hopeless. The
range on it is minimal.

367
00:18:25.540 --> 00:18:28.850
So Not something that I
could have, like a small

368
00:18:28.850 --> 00:18:31.370
conference and have 10, 15
of my friends over with.

369
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.130
No, I think that'd be
pushing the envelope on that

370
00:18:34.130 --> 00:18:36.620
thing for, for any more
than three or four machines.

371
00:18:36.620 --> 00:18:38.840
I think you're a little
wishful for something quite this

372
00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:41.000
small is not a lot
of range, not a lot

373
00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.410
of power, but it will
work for sharing two machines

374
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:48.260
or tooth machines, four machines
on the same internet. Okay.

375
00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:49.730
And would this be the
kind of thing where if

376
00:18:49.730 --> 00:18:51.680
I was at a hotel
and I had like my

377
00:18:51.680 --> 00:18:54.470
laptop netbook, and let's say
a cell phone that had

378
00:18:54.470 --> 00:18:57.890
wifi, this would be a
good, a good thing. Absolutely.

379
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.350
I think you're, you're exactly
describing the scenario where you

380
00:19:00.350 --> 00:19:02.540
would use one of these.
It sounds like 40, 40

381
00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:03.920
bucks on Amazon. It sounds
like a heck of a

382
00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.140
deal. Yeah. You can't really
go wrong. And my, I

383
00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:09.440
have burned a couple of
them up, but all, all

384
00:19:09.440 --> 00:19:14.330
of these really lightweight wireless
devices, they eventually fail. Right?

385
00:19:14.540 --> 00:19:16.430
I mean, I can't tell
you how many little links

386
00:19:16.430 --> 00:19:18.800
this nodes I've gone through
over the years. None of

387
00:19:18.800 --> 00:19:21.080
them lasts forever. So just
be prepared for the fact

388
00:19:21.080 --> 00:19:23.210
that after a year or
two, if you use it

389
00:19:23.210 --> 00:19:26.930
regularly, it will be cooked
And that not literally burned

390
00:19:26.930 --> 00:19:29.330
up, but it'll just die
one day. Yeah. One day

391
00:19:29.330 --> 00:19:33.020
it won't respond to anymore.
Crazy. All right. Well, that

392
00:19:33.020 --> 00:19:34.160
sounds like a plus for
me, I'm going to get

393
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:38.300
that. Awesome. Now you had
a video camera on your

394
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:41.480
list. You had a little
portable camera. I'm a fan

395
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.540
of the flip and my
wife just got the ultra

396
00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:48.470
HD and she's crazy about
it. And I think the

397
00:19:48.470 --> 00:19:50.720
big thing with this one
is that it's a D

398
00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:53.810
it's, there's a lot of
small video cameras, no two

399
00:19:53.810 --> 00:19:55.790
ways about it, right? There's
lots of different video cameras

400
00:19:55.790 --> 00:19:58.700
that are made. What I
like about the particular this

401
00:19:58.700 --> 00:20:01.250
flip, they, it works well
with the regular mortals. It's

402
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:03.500
got a USB port on
it. You plug it in,

403
00:20:03.770 --> 00:20:05.990
it's got its drivers on
it's dirt, simple to set

404
00:20:05.990 --> 00:20:07.670
up and you can get
these videos out of it

405
00:20:07.670 --> 00:20:11.540
very easily. The battery life
on it's outstanding. So we,

406
00:20:11.750 --> 00:20:14.930
we dragged one to Nepal
and back and took all

407
00:20:14.930 --> 00:20:18.200
kinds of little videos with
it. And it served extremely

408
00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:21.170
well. Now this is the
ultra HD or the Mino

409
00:20:21.170 --> 00:20:24.680
HD. She's got an ultra
HD, which, And what is

410
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.870
the difference between the Mino
and the ultra? We're really

411
00:20:26.870 --> 00:20:29.000
sure that the, you know,
the ultra was sort of

412
00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:30.440
the top of the line.
And I have heard a

413
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:34.100
few folks complaining that it
has problems, but I haven't

414
00:20:34.100 --> 00:20:37.040
found any, like, it's always
served just fine for us.

415
00:20:37.370 --> 00:20:39.710
Okay. I'm looking at their
website here. It looks like

416
00:20:39.710 --> 00:20:42.680
they're both the Mino HD
and the ultra HD are

417
00:20:42.680 --> 00:20:47.200
both about $199. The minnows
got four gigs and the

418
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.600
ultra has got eight gigs,
which means the amino we'll

419
00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:51.580
do an hour. And the
ultra we'll do two hours.

420
00:20:52.590 --> 00:20:54.670
It looks like the real
difference is that the ultra

421
00:20:54.670 --> 00:20:56.740
is over an inch thick
and the Mino is almost

422
00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:58.450
a half an inch thick.
So it really is about

423
00:20:58.450 --> 00:21:01.740
size. It appears. Yep. But
either way, these things are

424
00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.590
the size of a, of
a deck of cards. Really?

425
00:21:04.590 --> 00:21:07.800
They're small. Yeah. And they'll
both do a seven 20

426
00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:12.870
P full HD. Now I've
had the ultra, the original

427
00:21:12.870 --> 00:21:14.850
ultra, right. And I had
the Mino and then I

428
00:21:14.850 --> 00:21:16.620
got the amino HD and
I sent them all back

429
00:21:17.310 --> 00:21:22.820
and I bought a creative
<inaudible> HD camera. And I

430
00:21:22.820 --> 00:21:24.660
actually wrote this up on
my blog. And I felt

431
00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:28.020
that the low light on
the, on the Vato was

432
00:21:28.020 --> 00:21:30.750
better. And you can get
a Vato now for a

433
00:21:30.750 --> 00:21:33.510
hundred bucks on Amazon, at
least, you know, maybe, maybe

434
00:21:33.510 --> 00:21:35.460
a week. And you know
about it until the price

435
00:21:35.460 --> 00:21:38.340
goes up on, on amazon.com,
at least in the U

436
00:21:38.340 --> 00:21:41.400
S I saw this up
there for 99 bucks. So

437
00:21:41.730 --> 00:21:45.090
there's options between the flip
and the, and the Mino.

438
00:21:45.100 --> 00:21:47.250
And I flip the Mino
in Nevada and I've seen

439
00:21:47.250 --> 00:21:50.340
them all at different price
points. So I think that

440
00:21:50.370 --> 00:21:52.140
you got to keep an
eye, never pay retail for

441
00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:54.570
one of these little tiny
camcorders, cause you really can

442
00:21:54.570 --> 00:21:59.790
find a good, good, good
deals on them. Should you

443
00:21:59.790 --> 00:22:02.340
pay, did you pay retail?
No, I think we've got

444
00:22:02.340 --> 00:22:03.900
a pretty good, we got
to pick this one up

445
00:22:03.900 --> 00:22:07.920
at a Costco For less.
Very cool. Yeah. I send

446
00:22:07.920 --> 00:22:11.010
them one 30, one 29.
Yeah. You should be able

447
00:22:11.010 --> 00:22:16.050
to get 40, 50 bucks
off. Definitely. Okay. Now, not

448
00:22:16.050 --> 00:22:17.790
to override you, but on
the other end of the

449
00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:22.740
spectrum for video cameras, the
Canon EOS five D Mark

450
00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:26.280
too. This is a SLR
camera that also does HD

451
00:22:26.730 --> 00:22:30.690
yes. And a 10 80
PhD. But the big, The

452
00:22:30.690 --> 00:22:33.840
thing is suddenly you have
this camera able to do

453
00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.600
these beautiful HD recordings and
you put different lenses on

454
00:22:36.600 --> 00:22:40.680
it. So, you know, serious
filmmakers are starting to use

455
00:22:40.680 --> 00:22:44.220
this SLR as their recording
camera, just because the lenses

456
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.840
offer such incredible ability to
do outstanding shots, but this

457
00:22:48.840 --> 00:22:52.200
is not a trivial acquisition.
The body by itself is

458
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.720
about two grand and you
really should spend about a

459
00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.690
thousand dollars or so on
a lens or two or

460
00:22:57.690 --> 00:23:03.720
three. And so it's not
a lightweight purchase, but unbelievable

461
00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.520
what folks are doing with
the five D it is

462
00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:07.740
really a stunning count. And
even as a camera, I

463
00:23:07.740 --> 00:23:09.270
had a chance to play
with one. I do not

464
00:23:09.270 --> 00:23:11.040
own one, but I did
get a chance to play

465
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.060
with one and the 21
megapixel sensor. It's so light

466
00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.290
sensitive that with a decent,
a spherical lens in indoor

467
00:23:19.290 --> 00:23:21.870
lighting, without a flash, I
was actually able to crank

468
00:23:21.870 --> 00:23:24.990
the exposure up so much.
I overexposed on indoor lighting.

469
00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:28.500
So it's just really the
kind of camera where if

470
00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.380
you take the time to
learn to use it and

471
00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:32.490
you it, and the price
of it, doesn't kill you.

472
00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:34.380
This is a picture. This
is a camera that will

473
00:23:34.380 --> 00:23:36.450
get pictures of your kids.
You couldn't get any other

474
00:23:36.450 --> 00:23:39.200
way. And how much does
something like this cost And

475
00:23:39.200 --> 00:23:42.030
about 20 2020 500 for
the body, depending on how

476
00:23:42.030 --> 00:23:44.550
well you shop and a
thousand or so for a

477
00:23:44.550 --> 00:23:48.230
good lens. Wow. That is
a, that is a lot

478
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:50.360
of money. It's an expensive
toy. This is the thing,

479
00:23:50.810 --> 00:23:53.660
you know, Pete Brown who's
on my team at Microsoft

480
00:23:53.660 --> 00:23:57.950
has this really great HD
camera. And recently my creative

481
00:23:57.950 --> 00:24:00.230
Auto's battery died in the
middle of a shoot. And

482
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:01.640
I switched over to his,
and you can go to

483
00:24:01.640 --> 00:24:04.370
channel nine and you can
guess which of the HD

484
00:24:04.370 --> 00:24:06.830
videos that we shot were
done with the hundred dollar

485
00:24:06.830 --> 00:24:09.470
camera and which one we're
done with the $1,200 camera.

486
00:24:10.340 --> 00:24:14.330
And it, it, it's, it's
hard to, it's hard to

487
00:24:14.330 --> 00:24:19.220
quantify. What's better about the
thousand dollar camera, but it

488
00:24:19.220 --> 00:24:22.760
is better. It is right.
It is an unquestionably better,

489
00:24:23.390 --> 00:24:25.070
but you know, I'm not
sure it's like, is it

490
00:24:25.070 --> 00:24:28.340
clearer? Is it just more
natural, more, better color? I

491
00:24:28.340 --> 00:24:29.960
don't know what it is,
but it just does seems

492
00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.420
to have something that the
a hundred dollar one doesn't

493
00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:37.010
work. The question is, is
that something worth a thousand

494
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.580
dollars, right. And I am
notoriously cheap and I just,

495
00:24:40.760 --> 00:24:45.230
it would have to be
freaking amazing if, you know,

496
00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:46.670
for me to justify that
kind of money. And then

497
00:24:46.670 --> 00:24:49.970
you just said yours is
$2,200. You know, if I

498
00:24:49.970 --> 00:24:52.100
were a professional, I could,
I could do it. But

499
00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.800
man, that's a lot of
money. You're not going to

500
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.750
get done with a Canon
like that for less than

501
00:24:55.750 --> 00:24:58.510
three grand. Right. And then
the other point is that

502
00:24:58.510 --> 00:25:00.490
this is not just a
camera that I pick up

503
00:25:00.820 --> 00:25:03.760
and for three grand, I'm
awesome. This means three grand

504
00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:06.280
and some classes at the
local community college about aperture

505
00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.310
and shutter speed that's right.
Well, and the reality, of

506
00:25:09.310 --> 00:25:12.580
course it has all those
automatic modes, but you know,

507
00:25:13.090 --> 00:25:14.830
it's like a fool to
use. Yeah. You own a

508
00:25:14.830 --> 00:25:17.110
Ferrari and you drive it
in and you put it

509
00:25:17.110 --> 00:25:19.240
in drive, right? Like you're
just missing out on what

510
00:25:19.240 --> 00:25:21.700
it's capable of. And this
is the thing, it depends

511
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.640
on what you decide to
care about. Right? So this

512
00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:27.460
actually brings me to another
device that's kind of nice.

513
00:25:27.460 --> 00:25:29.590
And this is actually something
that Jeff Atwood turned me

514
00:25:29.590 --> 00:25:34.630
on to. It's the lacrosse
technology VC 9,009 alpha power

515
00:25:34.630 --> 00:25:39.520
battery charger is a, a
high end battery charger for

516
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:43.180
people who care about a
mil amps and how much

517
00:25:43.210 --> 00:25:44.650
they can, how much life
they can get out of

518
00:25:44.650 --> 00:25:47.380
a battery. It's not just
a regular battery charger where

519
00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:49.810
you just drop batteries in
and forget about them. But

520
00:25:49.810 --> 00:25:53.050
it's got all the details
on a little LCD and

521
00:25:53.050 --> 00:25:55.960
it tells you about, you
know, how much current it

522
00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.880
can provide. It can give
a full amp, it can

523
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.830
give 200 mil amps and
can ramp it up and

524
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:04.690
down. It can charge all
cells from 200 amps to

525
00:26:04.690 --> 00:26:08.890
two full amps. You can
go the 9,009 or the

526
00:26:08.890 --> 00:26:12.460
9,000, which is a faster
charger. It's got a nice

527
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.890
little four column LCD. That'll
tell you whether or not

528
00:26:15.700 --> 00:26:19.150
something's charging. It does double
A's. It does triple A's

529
00:26:19.570 --> 00:26:21.760
and it'll do all different,
different brands. And it's also

530
00:26:21.760 --> 00:26:24.760
a conditioner. So if you
have an old cell, an

531
00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.280
old battery that you want
to bring back, you can

532
00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:31.450
go through the, you know,
deep discharge and refresh function.

533
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:33.460
And then it'll also tell
you when it thinks that

534
00:26:34.200 --> 00:26:36.400
a cell is dead and
when you should toss it.

535
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:38.410
So if you want to,
you're a cheap bastard and

536
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:40.810
you want to squeeze as
much out of a rechargeable

537
00:26:40.810 --> 00:26:45.540
battery as possible. And it
definitely the battery charger to

538
00:26:45.540 --> 00:26:47.360
check out. And it's only
40 bucks. And you're talking

539
00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:50.510
about Nike heads and nickel
metal hydride batteries, right? Yes.

540
00:26:50.690 --> 00:26:53.090
Primarily nickel metal hydride. You
don't really know cats or

541
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:55.310
are 10 years old. You
probably just want to give

542
00:26:55.310 --> 00:26:57.590
up on that. Cause you
can go and get like

543
00:26:57.590 --> 00:27:00.170
a S a Sanyo and
a loop. You can buy

544
00:27:00.170 --> 00:27:03.290
an eight pack for 20
bucks of nickel, metal height,

545
00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:05.480
whereas in the antelopes are
nice because they're already charged

546
00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:08.420
when you buy them. Right.
So, you know, between that

547
00:27:08.810 --> 00:27:11.540
and this, this battery charger,
you could do your whole

548
00:27:11.540 --> 00:27:14.510
family worth of batteries. Well,
the thing is, if you

549
00:27:14.510 --> 00:27:18.830
treat metal hydrates, well, they'll
last a several hundred recharges.

550
00:27:18.830 --> 00:27:22.430
So it's also somewhat of
an ecological thing that you're

551
00:27:22.430 --> 00:27:25.400
producing a lot less battery
waste if you do this

552
00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:28.010
well, right? Of course you
have to keep track of

553
00:27:28.010 --> 00:27:30.290
them. And the thing is
that we're so built in

554
00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:35.030
just throwing our batteries in
the kitchen, a kitchen drawer,

555
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.760
and forgetting about them that
they, they, you can, if

556
00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:39.860
you don't treat the batteries
with respect, then you're gonna

557
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:43.100
start treating all these expensive
batteries like disposables, and then

558
00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.100
they'll get spread all over
the house. So if you're,

559
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.390
if you're a house that
uses a lot of batteries,

560
00:27:47.390 --> 00:27:48.320
you got a lot of
toys. You got a lot

561
00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:52.370
of the gadgets consider switching
over to these, these batteries

562
00:27:52.370 --> 00:27:55.430
and then build yourself a
little battery station or declare

563
00:27:55.430 --> 00:27:57.950
some corner of the house,
the place where all batteries

564
00:27:57.950 --> 00:28:02.990
are. Right. What works for
us? All right. I've got

565
00:28:02.990 --> 00:28:06.230
another one. I also think
that 2010 is the year

566
00:28:06.230 --> 00:28:08.690
that the SSD is really
come of age as well.

567
00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:12.050
Oh yeah. Deeply. So, and
they're getting cheap. You can

568
00:28:12.050 --> 00:28:15.980
buy basic, you know, 32
and 64 gig SSDs for

569
00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.660
a hundred dollars, $150, O
C, Z just announced a

570
00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.290
one terabyte SSD. Wow. In
the three and a half

571
00:28:24.290 --> 00:28:26.960
inch form factor. That seems
a little over the top.

572
00:28:26.990 --> 00:28:29.600
But I think it also
makes the point that a

573
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:31.610
drive that small can have
a lot of storage. I

574
00:28:31.610 --> 00:28:33.920
think people are used to
64 gigs as, as, as

575
00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:38.960
a size. Yep. I've got
a 256 gig OCC Vertex,

576
00:28:38.990 --> 00:28:42.020
which is a fantastic, fantastic
drive. Yep. It was a,

577
00:28:42.030 --> 00:28:44.810
it was 600 bucks and
there is no better upgrade

578
00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:49.100
for your personal computer than
an SSD flat out Day

579
00:28:49.100 --> 00:28:50.930
and night. If there's one
thing you want to go

580
00:28:50.930 --> 00:28:53.900
out and buy your loved
one, to me that uses

581
00:28:53.900 --> 00:28:57.530
computers regularly, it's go get
an SSD. You'll be stunned

582
00:28:57.530 --> 00:29:00.860
at the difference. It it's,
it's obscene. It's like a

583
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.990
guaranteed 7.9 score on your
windows experience index immediately. You'll,

584
00:29:05.990 --> 00:29:08.390
you'll see boot up times,
you know, 10 seconds, 12

585
00:29:08.390 --> 00:29:12.170
seconds. You don't have to
defrag. If you get the,

586
00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.710
the Intel's done. Does the
OCC have the trim support

587
00:29:15.710 --> 00:29:18.980
that everyone talks about? Because
SSD start to slow down

588
00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:22.520
some, some single digit percentage
as they start getting used

589
00:29:22.970 --> 00:29:26.150
depending on their generation. And
then there's a command called

590
00:29:26.150 --> 00:29:29.360
trim. That's built into windows
seven. So the idea is

591
00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:32.000
if you have the updated
firmware and an SSD that

592
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.410
supports trim, this will prevent
that inevitable slow down and

593
00:29:36.440 --> 00:29:39.260
give you the speed that
you'd like throughout the life

594
00:29:39.260 --> 00:29:41.740
of the, of the SSD.
Yeah. And the OCC guys

595
00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.380
are pretty Good about good
firmware and their drives and

596
00:29:44.380 --> 00:29:46.960
maintaining them and so forth.
They're quite a reputable brand.

597
00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.940
And I think that's an
important part when you're talking

598
00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:51.490
about this kind of technology
is you can always find

599
00:29:51.490 --> 00:29:55.620
somebody selling something cheaper. It's
usually not worth it. You

600
00:29:55.620 --> 00:29:57.660
know, the well, you know,
but the don't the hardcore

601
00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.820
people say that the only
SSD in town is the

602
00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:02.990
<inaudible> from Intel. They do.
And I think they are

603
00:30:02.990 --> 00:30:05.070
a little overboard on that.
It doesn't need, it's not

604
00:30:05.070 --> 00:30:07.170
quite that severe. There are
other vendors out there that

605
00:30:07.170 --> 00:30:09.960
are making absolutely capable drives.
And like you said, you're

606
00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:14.460
using an OCC. They're excellent
drives. Yeah. I'm absolutely bananas

607
00:30:14.460 --> 00:30:16.920
over my OCS. And I
do know that Brad Wilson

608
00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.710
and other folks that are
really hardcore will say that,

609
00:30:20.130 --> 00:30:21.300
you know, if you're going
to go and spend the

610
00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:24.750
money, then you might as
well spend the money on

611
00:30:24.750 --> 00:30:28.530
a really, really nice drive.
And that means the Intel,

612
00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:30.630
but it's almost like saying,
you know, I'm going to

613
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:32.760
buy a new car. Well,
really you can only buy

614
00:30:32.760 --> 00:30:36.090
a Mercedes. There are no
other vehicles. And, and I

615
00:30:36.090 --> 00:30:37.680
think that that's a little
over the top. I think

616
00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:39.510
that if you can, you're
going to, if you can

617
00:30:39.510 --> 00:30:41.010
afford it. Sure. Go for
it. But the thing that

618
00:30:41.010 --> 00:30:44.400
I like about the 256
gig is that it's not

619
00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:48.600
small. It's, it's a little
spending, it's 600 bucks, but

620
00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:50.700
at the same time, let's
say that let's say worst

621
00:30:50.700 --> 00:30:55.080
case scenario, nightmare scenario. This
thing lasts a year, right?

622
00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:59.730
That's $2 a day for
365 days of joy of

623
00:30:59.730 --> 00:31:04.080
just pure. You know what
I mean? Just give up

624
00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:08.040
your latte once a day
and you'll just have a

625
00:31:08.040 --> 00:31:12.000
wonderful life or at least
a wonderful year of speed.

626
00:31:12.630 --> 00:31:17.460
Totally. And my best gauge
that these drives are actually

627
00:31:17.460 --> 00:31:19.920
improving in quality and less
risky is you're seeing their

628
00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.790
warranties go up. So OCC
is now offering three year

629
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.760
warranties on virtually everything five
years on their high end

630
00:31:26.760 --> 00:31:30.210
models. So bit by bit,
they're committed to the fact

631
00:31:30.210 --> 00:31:32.730
that these drives are, are
reliable and that the old

632
00:31:32.730 --> 00:31:35.820
problems of the earlier generation
ones have been overcome. Now,

633
00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:37.560
There is the concern that,
of course, when they die,

634
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:43.230
they die immediately. Yeah, it's
absolutely. That's true. But again,

635
00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.260
technology has changed such that
I'm backing up my computer

636
00:31:46.260 --> 00:31:48.570
every night, right? I have
a, I have a home

637
00:31:48.570 --> 00:31:52.560
server I ghosted every night
automatically. So while it's true

638
00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:54.870
that one day this SSD
will die and it won't

639
00:31:54.870 --> 00:31:58.230
be subtle. The MTBF on
these things is where they

640
00:31:58.230 --> 00:32:01.380
say three to five years.
So it's, it's conceivable that

641
00:32:01.380 --> 00:32:03.930
this thing will, will last
a couple of years. And

642
00:32:03.930 --> 00:32:06.600
by then I'll have bought
a larger, cheaper one. Yep.

643
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:09.360
And then technology is definitely
moving forward on these. But

644
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:11.280
I think we're at a
maturity point now where there

645
00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:15.330
are an easy replacement for
regular drives. Definitely. Let me

646
00:32:15.330 --> 00:32:16.830
see. One last thing. This
is kind of a silly

647
00:32:16.830 --> 00:32:19.470
one for me. And, and
you can give me a

648
00:32:19.470 --> 00:32:23.580
silly one too. This is
the paper pro nano miniature

649
00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:27.360
stapler, and, you know, silly,
silly to have a stapler

650
00:32:27.510 --> 00:32:30.570
on your, on your wishlist.
But this is a $9

651
00:32:30.570 --> 00:32:32.820
little stapler. And it just
is one of these staplers

652
00:32:32.820 --> 00:32:37.470
that always works. It seems
silly, but it is, it's

653
00:32:37.470 --> 00:32:40.100
got a ridiculous amount of
positive reviews. Amazon, everyone I've

654
00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:42.080
ever talked to who owns
one of these things is

655
00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:46.340
like literally impressed with it.
It staples like, you know,

656
00:32:46.640 --> 00:32:48.920
15 pages at a time,
even though it's rated for

657
00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:52.360
fewer, it's just a great
little tiny portable stapler. And

658
00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.560
I don't like to think
about my stapler. You know

659
00:32:54.560 --> 00:32:56.360
what I mean? The amount
of the amount of work

660
00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:59.180
that I've put into speaking
about the stapler now is

661
00:32:59.180 --> 00:33:05.060
probably more than any stapler
deserves. But I know if

662
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:06.740
I, if I thought about
it this much in my

663
00:33:06.740 --> 00:33:09.620
day to day, like I've
probably had bad stapler experiences

664
00:33:10.310 --> 00:33:12.830
and I've talked about it
less than this. So I

665
00:33:12.830 --> 00:33:14.480
will stop speaking. It's a
guy state player by it.

666
00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:19.300
It's a great little stapler
is the silly gadget that

667
00:33:19.300 --> 00:33:22.630
I played with lately is
at strange loop. I actually

668
00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:26.560
dropped off a couple of
remote control helicopters for flying

669
00:33:26.560 --> 00:33:31.210
between the cubes, really hard
to resist, you know, cube,

670
00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:34.090
cube, farm, life needs entertainment.
And when you have that,

671
00:33:34.230 --> 00:33:36.610
that four or five foot
space between the ceiling and

672
00:33:36.610 --> 00:33:38.500
the top edge of the
cubes, it just opens up

673
00:33:38.500 --> 00:33:41.620
an opportunity for helicopter passage
from end to end in

674
00:33:41.620 --> 00:33:49.000
the room, no windows seven
needed, but these little, these

675
00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:51.910
little remote control helicopters are
they're cheap. Now they're like

676
00:33:52.000 --> 00:33:54.460
$30 And you don't, you
don't plug them into windows

677
00:33:54.490 --> 00:33:56.730
and like, are the USB
powered and then they just

678
00:33:56.740 --> 00:34:01.870
try it. Yeah, No, they're
just regular electric electric helicopters.

679
00:34:02.470 --> 00:34:04.990
I just find that. I
just assume that everything charges

680
00:34:04.990 --> 00:34:08.020
USB now here, you know,
somebody, somebody showed me a

681
00:34:08.020 --> 00:34:11.620
picture of a USB pet
rock and I read sure

682
00:34:11.620 --> 00:34:13.780
why it charges on USP,
but it uses USB for

683
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:15.490
its power. I'm not sure
why the rock needs power.

684
00:34:15.490 --> 00:34:18.520
Maybe it's warm. You know,
I do so many USB

685
00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:21.670
toys, terrible USB toys all
the time. I think that

686
00:34:21.700 --> 00:34:23.980
the humping dog is like,
you know, where are we

687
00:34:23.980 --> 00:34:26.190
going with this? I haven't
all sorts of problems with

688
00:34:26.200 --> 00:34:28.780
USB. Cause I can't tell
some things support a ham.

689
00:34:28.810 --> 00:34:31.540
I have 500 mil amps
and some things I have

690
00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:34.390
a full lamp. I've got
this well, that Garmin NUVI

691
00:34:34.390 --> 00:34:38.230
I was mentioning. Yeah, I
lost the USB adapter for

692
00:34:38.230 --> 00:34:40.270
it and I want to
charge it. But every time

693
00:34:40.270 --> 00:34:42.340
I try to plug in
one of the random us

694
00:34:42.340 --> 00:34:46.060
mini USB AC adapters, I
have lying around, it thinks

695
00:34:46.060 --> 00:34:49.060
it's being connected to a
computer. So I can't have

696
00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:52.480
it plugged in and charging
at the same time, which

697
00:34:52.480 --> 00:34:56.470
makes it effectively useless. Right.
So I'm wondering if, if

698
00:34:56.470 --> 00:34:59.320
I can give it more
amps, will it realize it's

699
00:34:59.320 --> 00:35:02.080
not flooded into a committee
And just be fine? I

700
00:35:02.080 --> 00:35:05.200
don't know. Yeah, it should
be problem. I was going

701
00:35:05.200 --> 00:35:06.730
to say, or I just
go by the TomTom that

702
00:35:06.730 --> 00:35:08.380
you said to buy. Yeah.
Yeah. You can always go

703
00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:11.110
get the Tom, Tom. I
also think that coming up

704
00:35:11.110 --> 00:35:13.060
this year, we're going to
get the USB three is

705
00:35:13.060 --> 00:35:16.840
going to start showing up
with a 10 times faster

706
00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:23.740
transfer rate again, 10 times.
Yep. Five gigabit USB. So,

707
00:35:23.800 --> 00:35:27.010
well, You know, when it's,
when that comes, that might

708
00:35:27.010 --> 00:35:28.390
be time for me to
upgrade my machine, but I'm

709
00:35:28.390 --> 00:35:30.580
running the, you know, I'm
running the same machine, the

710
00:35:30.580 --> 00:35:33.790
same machine that Jeff Atwood
built for me. Yes. I

711
00:35:33.790 --> 00:35:36.040
have upgraded the Ram. I've
added hard drives and stuff.

712
00:35:36.040 --> 00:35:37.530
And I think all I'm
going to do now is

713
00:35:37.530 --> 00:35:40.470
I'll probably add an SSD
to this machine. I added

714
00:35:40.470 --> 00:35:45.810
the, the two 56 one.
I added that to my,

715
00:35:46.020 --> 00:35:50.090
my laptop And it made
big difference. I had a

716
00:35:50.090 --> 00:35:53.180
massive difference. It'll be interesting
to see what happens with

717
00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.300
USB three, because of course,
obviously we're gonna need devices

718
00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.950
as well. I think the
big thing is going to

719
00:35:57.950 --> 00:36:02.060
be drives that, that, that
transfer weight we can we'll

720
00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.400
finally have drives that run
as fast on USB as

721
00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:08.480
they do internally. Hmm. Hey,
did you buy a Zune

722
00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.980
HD or do you guys
not have that in Canada?

723
00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:15.530
Not available Kennedy yet? No,
they are gorgeous though. We

724
00:36:15.530 --> 00:36:17.450
are using it all the
time. The kids were just

725
00:36:17.450 --> 00:36:19.400
listening to it in the
car. I actually, I went

726
00:36:19.400 --> 00:36:21.380
and we liked the Zune
so much because of that.

727
00:36:21.440 --> 00:36:23.720
We have, we had actually
three zones, but you can

728
00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:26.300
plug them all into one
account. Right. So we only

729
00:36:26.300 --> 00:36:30.380
have to pay once and
then get as much music

730
00:36:30.380 --> 00:36:31.670
as we want. And then
I actually went and bought

731
00:36:31.670 --> 00:36:36.230
my wife a, a new
in dash player for her

732
00:36:36.230 --> 00:36:39.500
car that will let her
plug the zone in. Beautiful.

733
00:36:39.770 --> 00:36:42.950
And she's listening to that
a lot more than, than

734
00:36:42.950 --> 00:36:46.460
anything else. Yeah. It's interesting.
MP3 players are now evicuitous

735
00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.860
nobody thinks anything of them
anymore. I found my old

736
00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:54.740
diamond Rio, the original 16
megabyte that came out as

737
00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:57.290
soon as the court case
had been resolved. You remember

738
00:36:57.290 --> 00:37:00.290
that there was a Supreme
court case over MP3 the

739
00:37:00.290 --> 00:37:04.490
day that was settled in
Diamond's favor. I ordered one.

740
00:37:04.490 --> 00:37:07.160
So I have like one
of the first thousand. Very

741
00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:10.310
nice. Yeah. And it's a,
it's ancient. It's a great

742
00:37:10.310 --> 00:37:12.960
big thing with no capacity.
Hmm. You can put four

743
00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:14.900
it and put four songs
on that thing. Something like

744
00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.140
that. Yeah. Cool. Alright. Well
that is our gadget gift

745
00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.030
guide. We'll put links to
all of that up on

746
00:37:20.030 --> 00:37:23.360
the show and we'll return
next week for some more

747
00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:26.180
technical content. But for now
I am Scott Hanselman and

748
00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:29.570
thank you, Richard Campbell, always a
pleasure. This has been another

749
00:37:29.570 --> 00:37:32.240
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll
see you again next week.
