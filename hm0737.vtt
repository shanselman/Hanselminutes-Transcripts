That's Datadog hq.com/hansel minutes. Alright,
This is Scott Hanselman. This

13
00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:07.220
is another episode of Hansel
minutes today. I'm talking to

14
00:01:07.220 --> 00:01:10.550
Lauren Gray. Who's on the Azure
red team at Microsoft. How

15
00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.030
are you, sir? I'm doing
all right. Yeah. Doing pretty

16
00:01:14.030 --> 00:01:19.730
well. So red team, what
is that? So the red

17
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.790
team is, or a red
team in general is a

18
00:01:22.790 --> 00:01:26.780
team that performs a adversary
emulation. So our job is

19
00:01:26.840 --> 00:01:29.750
to pretend to be the
bad guys and tackle all

20
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:35.450
your stuff Seriously, like adversary
emulation. That is a pretty

21
00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:38.270
awesome way to phrase it.
That's that's the, like the

22
00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:43.070
official, like a formal terminology
for it. People were just

23
00:01:43.070 --> 00:01:45.260
like, Oh yeah, you're hackers.
And they kind of just

24
00:01:45.260 --> 00:01:48.770
put everybody in the same,
the same bubble red teaming

25
00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:51.950
is like a very specific
form of it, right? So

26
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:53.960
you have like pen testers
and you have red teamers

27
00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:58.250
and vulnerability assessment assessors, and
everyone does a really different

28
00:01:58.250 --> 00:02:01.610
job. But our job is
to pretend to be act

29
00:02:01.700 --> 00:02:04.670
or act as real attackers.
Is there a blue team

30
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:06.530
I've heard that term as
well? Yeah. So the blue

31
00:02:06.530 --> 00:02:11.150
team, our counterparts and they're
the ones defending, right? So

32
00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:15.890
their job is to being
able to detect and evict

33
00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:21.650
red teamers or even sometimes
real attackers. Okay. So hang

34
00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.680
on. You're the adversary emulator.
You are pretending to be

35
00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.940
evil. You're the red team,
the blue team is like

36
00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.830
maybe he's sitting in the
same building and they're on

37
00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:33.620
the other side trying to
keep you out. Figuratively speaking,

38
00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:36.680
figuratively speaking, everything we're saying
is fairly speaking. I don't

39
00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.710
mean there, like legitimately in
the next cubicle over, but

40
00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.460
like from a boxes and
lines perspective, do you all

41
00:02:43.460 --> 00:02:45.260
have lunch together? Do you
even know who they are?

42
00:02:45.260 --> 00:02:47.240
Like the teams are, they
separated and hidden from each

43
00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.050
other? So at Microsoft there's
a bunch of red teams

44
00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:53.810
and there's a bunch of
blue teams. And not everybody

45
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.060
who you may not know
who everybody is, right. So

46
00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:59.710
if we're performing an operation
against one service, right, they

47
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:01.450
may have a specific blue
team that they need to

48
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:04.360
go to in order to
resolve issues. It may not

49
00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:07.180
be the same blue team
as another service from a

50
00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:10.750
different organization. So like they
have to know who their

51
00:03:10.750 --> 00:03:14.080
blue teams are, but we,
as the Azure red team

52
00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:18.550
have like this oversight or
scope rather than like all

53
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:23.140
of, all of Azure. So
we come across different blue

54
00:03:23.140 --> 00:03:25.650
teams. So if I were
going to make a thing,

55
00:03:25.650 --> 00:03:27.720
let's say I was going
to make a new service.

56
00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:30.150
Like, I don't know Scott
as a service and it's

57
00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:31.890
going to be an, I
proposed to the bosses and

58
00:03:31.890 --> 00:03:33.060
I've done all this kind
of stuff and we've done

59
00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:34.440
the work and we're going
to put it live in

60
00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.270
Azure. And we're going to
start doing that. I assume

61
00:03:36.270 --> 00:03:39.150
that there's a series of
security checkpoints. That one has

62
00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:44.170
to go through and surviving
regular, multiple red team attacks.

63
00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.570
Seems like a thing that
I would put on my

64
00:03:45.570 --> 00:03:49.860
checklist. Yeah, for sure. There's
definitely a, like a security

65
00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:56.940
assurance kind of deal that
happens. I'm not really knowledgeable

66
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:00.120
about that aspect of it.
Sure. But your job is

67
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:03.630
to basically, when I suppose
is this is the red

68
00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:05.580
team's job to say, Hey,
we tried as hard as

69
00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.350
we could and we couldn't
get in. Or is it

70
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:09.510
more successful to say, Hey,
we got in and here's

71
00:04:09.510 --> 00:04:12.210
how we mitigate that Either
is fine. Right? So a

72
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:15.870
red team is, or offensive
security in general, the point

73
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:18.300
isn't to like be successful
all the time. Like be

74
00:04:18.390 --> 00:04:21.930
social feels good, but the
whole point is to assess

75
00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:25.220
the security posture. So if
we can't get in and

76
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:28.050
you like, we are being
stopped and blocked completely, it's

77
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:30.990
a good thing overall for
security, it may hurt our

78
00:04:30.990 --> 00:04:34.350
feelings, but like our feelings
don't matter in the overall

79
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:38.550
scheme of, of making sure
things are secure. And is

80
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.640
it, you said operations, that
term operations is interesting because

81
00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:44.280
it implies like kind of
a finite, like you're not

82
00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:46.590
just sitting around thinking of
crazy stuff that you can

83
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:48.780
do to break into a
system. You'll be, you might

84
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:50.670
be saying, Hey, we're going
to focus on, you know,

85
00:04:50.790 --> 00:04:53.700
service a or, or project
B right now. And for

86
00:04:53.700 --> 00:04:56.400
the next month, we're going
to go through this list

87
00:04:56.430 --> 00:04:58.110
to try to deal with
this. You are kind of

88
00:04:58.110 --> 00:05:02.630
like hired as mercenaries effectively
digital mercenaries to, to, to

89
00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.040
like, like in the movies
when someone says, Hey, can

90
00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:07.680
you break into my safe
here? You know, here's the

91
00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.330
parameters you have three days
to get into my safe.

92
00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.810
It's kind of, it's kind
of both like, we'll, we'll

93
00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:16.260
do like our regular operations
against a specific service. And

94
00:05:16.260 --> 00:05:18.360
that's how, that's how our
operations are broken out into,

95
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:21.390
at the same time. We're
always trying to come up

96
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.090
with new techniques for things,
right. To try something that

97
00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:27.870
we may have, we may
not have seen before, but

98
00:05:28.110 --> 00:05:30.720
we kind of assume that,
and the general assumption is

99
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.460
that if you can do
it, then somebody else can

100
00:05:32.460 --> 00:05:35.220
do it. Whereas somebody else
might have thought of it

101
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:38.430
first, if you have that
mindset, then anything like any

102
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:41.940
new technique that we create,
we just assume that somebody

103
00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.730
else has done it before.
And we go to verify

104
00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:46.980
that it's not like a
systemic issue and that no

105
00:05:46.980 --> 00:05:49.980
one else has been affected
by this. So it's kind

106
00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:51.240
of, it's kind of both
like, we will do a

107
00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:53.430
normal operations against the service,
but at the same time,

108
00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:58.550
we're trying to find new
tactics that our team may

109
00:05:58.550 --> 00:06:01.400
not have seen, or may
have not, may not have

110
00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:06.470
been, you know, detected by
the blue teams or, you

111
00:06:06.470 --> 00:06:11.570
know, the security operation centers
and say, Nope, has this

112
00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:14.710
been done before? So I
understand that there's all kinds

113
00:06:14.710 --> 00:06:17.500
of kits that one can
download. Like I might have

114
00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:20.050
a WordPress site or a
blog or whatever, some custom

115
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:25.570
CMS, there's all kinds of
like Swiss army knife, security,

116
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:27.610
things that I can say,
Hey, go attack that. And

117
00:06:27.610 --> 00:06:31.750
it kind of runs through
the obvious stuff. Those are

118
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:34.000
those tools that you use.
Do you use the obvious

119
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:36.850
things just to make sure
nothing's regressed or gone backwards?

120
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:40.210
So our team was a
little bit different. Yeah. So

121
00:06:40.240 --> 00:06:42.550
in general, like for red
teaming, there are a lot

122
00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:45.400
of tools that you can
use a lot of C

123
00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:47.380
two systems, which is like
a, you know, you have

124
00:06:47.380 --> 00:06:49.720
a server and then you
have like an agent on

125
00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:53.110
someone's computer and then you're
interacting with their computer that,

126
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:57.160
you know, that you've hacked.
But our team's a little

127
00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:01.780
bit different in Azure and
that's because a significant portion

128
00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:07.000
of, of enterprises or, or
even like security professionals are

129
00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.400
just learning Azure and for
the last year or so,

130
00:07:09.460 --> 00:07:13.930
as it comes more relevant
and more prevalent rather like

131
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.140
in the field. So there
aren't a lot of Azure

132
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.220
tools that are public. I
think within the last six

133
00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:26.020
months, I can name three
that are pretty prominent and

134
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:30.280
sure, like we can, we
can run those and check

135
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.160
them out. But our perspective
is different because we are

136
00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:36.520
internal as opposed to someone
who is externally trying to

137
00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:40.300
attack. So we always go
with a, like an assumed

138
00:07:40.300 --> 00:07:44.110
breach methodology and it's in
breached means that, okay, we

139
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:46.570
are an attacker who was
in the environment already, what

140
00:07:46.570 --> 00:07:51.160
can we do from that
perspective? I want to dig

141
00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.230
into that. But before we
do, you made the comment

142
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.870
a C to the letter
C the number two command

143
00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:57.400
and control. Maybe you could
just say a little bit

144
00:07:57.400 --> 00:07:59.620
about that for folks who
aren't familiar with that acronym.

145
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:03.520
So C two systems are,
or is it sort of

146
00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:05.830
a, a tool that an
attacker will use in order

147
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:09.640
to control a remote system?
Right. So if I make

148
00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:12.760
you ask you to download
this executable and you click

149
00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.340
it, right, or you open
up this word document, right.

150
00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.940
I may install a <inaudible>
on your device, right. To

151
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.490
be able to control it
remotely. Okay. So then at

152
00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:25.360
that point, your own, your
poned, and you, that's the

153
00:08:25.360 --> 00:08:28.120
assumption that you should just
act as, as everything that

154
00:08:28.120 --> 00:08:30.610
you're doing is on a
machine that is already compromised,

155
00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.730
Right? So we'll, we'll still
do all that initial free

156
00:08:33.730 --> 00:08:35.800
con phase for a lot
of our operations where we

157
00:08:35.800 --> 00:08:39.490
know maybe we go find
the credential, but because we

158
00:08:39.490 --> 00:08:43.390
do mostly internal or all,
I should say, mostly all

159
00:08:43.390 --> 00:08:47.440
of our operations are internal
assessments with Microsoft teams. We

160
00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:51.580
are already inside Microsoft from
most angles. Whereas an attacker

161
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.080
has to figure out a
way how to get in

162
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:57.000
first. We just assume that
they've already gotten in and

163
00:08:57.510 --> 00:09:00.300
we have some level of
access from that service that

164
00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:03.200
we're operating against in order
to do things. Is that

165
00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:06.620
really important to just assume
that you're owned already? Like,

166
00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:08.690
you know, the call is
coming from inside the house.

167
00:09:08.990 --> 00:09:11.420
I hear that more and
more in the last, maybe

168
00:09:11.420 --> 00:09:14.810
10 years of, of computer
science, you just assume that

169
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:17.240
they're already on a compromised
system. And then the question

170
00:09:17.240 --> 00:09:19.740
is, once they're in, can
you keep them in the

171
00:09:19.760 --> 00:09:22.070
<inaudible> affair effectively? Or can
you keep them in the

172
00:09:22.070 --> 00:09:24.710
man cage at the front
of the house they've breached

173
00:09:24.710 --> 00:09:27.200
the front door. But once
they're in, in the old

174
00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:28.850
days, we would assume that
they just, they have the

175
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:30.950
keys to the castle and
they can do everything. But

176
00:09:30.950 --> 00:09:32.780
in the, in the modern
times, it's like, well, they

177
00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:34.370
got into the mode, but
they can't get out of

178
00:09:34.370 --> 00:09:36.770
the mode. And that's okay.
So the reason why I

179
00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:42.140
assume breach is such a
common methodology is because you

180
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:46.280
can always assume that phishing
is going to work, right?

181
00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.770
So that whole act of,
of getting initial access is

182
00:09:48.770 --> 00:09:51.950
generally more of a, just
a time consuming manner, because

183
00:09:52.100 --> 00:09:54.320
it's eventually going to work.
Someone's going to open something

184
00:09:54.710 --> 00:09:58.070
or click something that they're
not supposed to, and an

185
00:09:58.070 --> 00:10:02.180
attacker will have access. And
so that's generally the mindset

186
00:10:02.180 --> 00:10:03.860
behind it is that you
are going to get initial

187
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:10.460
access. Somehow it's going to
happen regardless of, of, of

188
00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.860
how, how much, how many
systems you try to have

189
00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:17.270
in place to, you know,
prevent it. But we, when

190
00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:20.630
we go that route, we
can just say, instead of

191
00:10:20.630 --> 00:10:22.670
having to waste our time,
Oh, not really invest the

192
00:10:22.670 --> 00:10:27.830
time into getting that initial
access is it's, it's more

193
00:10:27.830 --> 00:10:31.250
logical to assume that the
access already exists. Right. And

194
00:10:31.250 --> 00:10:33.800
then I understand that the
access that they have should

195
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:35.300
be limited, right? This is
why we don't want to

196
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:37.670
have super users. You have
role based access security. It's

197
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:40.040
like, well, they got in,
but they have read access

198
00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:42.860
to data that is limited
in scope, as opposed to

199
00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:46.280
the old days of they
have the essay password. Right?

200
00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.560
So like in traditional red
teaming, w w what you

201
00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.800
might normally get is like
a user level account, right?

202
00:10:52.940 --> 00:10:57.470
And a lot of companies
will ask or give a

203
00:10:57.470 --> 00:11:00.620
lot of consulting. Companies will
give like their, their organizations,

204
00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:04.580
target organizations, a computer or
laptop or something, and just

205
00:11:04.580 --> 00:11:07.700
say, put this in your,
your network, and then give

206
00:11:07.700 --> 00:11:10.460
us a, the credentials for
a, a user, just a

207
00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:13.790
normal user. And we'll see
what we can do for

208
00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:17.300
Azure. It's a little bit
different because, or at least

209
00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:22.670
internally, because we don't, we,
we already work at Microsoft.

210
00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:26.390
We were not trying to
pretend to be, you know,

211
00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:28.880
we don't need that level
of access. So our assumed

212
00:11:28.880 --> 00:11:34.100
breaches is always from our
perspective. Oh, no, it is

213
00:11:34.100 --> 00:11:37.670
generally from our perspective as
employees of Microsoft. Interesting. So

214
00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.920
that was my next question.
So it's like, I'm imagining

215
00:11:39.950 --> 00:11:42.200
my job. I'm imagining I
work on the red team

216
00:11:42.470 --> 00:11:45.410
and I'm thinking to myself,
how does this work? Do

217
00:11:45.410 --> 00:11:47.720
I pretend that I don't
work for the company? Do

218
00:11:47.720 --> 00:11:49.490
I pretend that I work
with the company? And I'm

219
00:11:49.490 --> 00:11:53.650
just evil, you know, who,
what's my role that playing

220
00:11:53.650 --> 00:11:56.650
for the particular operation that
I'm about to do. And

221
00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:59.640
sometimes it changes. So you
may have different operations with

222
00:11:59.640 --> 00:12:02.520
different perspectives and requests that
are asked of us. And

223
00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:06.840
so the question may be
can an external person get

224
00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:10.200
directly to this resource? And
we have to sometimes answer

225
00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:14.220
that question, but generally speaking,
we're coming from we're. We

226
00:12:14.220 --> 00:12:18.120
are coming from the inside.
And we are assuming that

227
00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:21.720
if a user had, or
if an attacker had somehow

228
00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:25.680
compromised corporate credentials, right, what
could they do with this?

229
00:12:25.740 --> 00:12:29.040
From the perspective of that
particular service team? Now, you

230
00:12:29.400 --> 00:12:31.950
you're, you have a background
in cyber operations. This has

231
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:34.620
been your whole thing for
a very long time. And

232
00:12:34.620 --> 00:12:36.330
I noticed that one of
the things that you did

233
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:38.670
was you worked on penetration
testing and you get a

234
00:12:38.670 --> 00:12:41.790
certificate in ethical hacking. Why
is that word ethical so

235
00:12:41.790 --> 00:12:45.690
important in front of hacking?
What is ethical hacking? Depends

236
00:12:45.690 --> 00:12:48.300
who you ask. So I'm
asking you, and that's why

237
00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:51.930
I want to understand. All
right. So that, that particular

238
00:12:51.930 --> 00:12:57.240
certificate ch has, which is
what is most commonly known

239
00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.520
as to be one of
the most baseline certificates you

240
00:13:02.520 --> 00:13:06.210
can get. And it, they,
they try to stress it

241
00:13:06.780 --> 00:13:10.410
ethical it's because the word
hacker has been thrown around

242
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:14.970
as a negative thing for
so long. They'll put ethical

243
00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:17.240
in front of it in
order to say, no, this

244
00:13:17.310 --> 00:13:21.360
we're not teaching people how
to do bad things for

245
00:13:21.360 --> 00:13:23.760
the purpose of doing bad
things. We're teaching people, the

246
00:13:23.760 --> 00:13:26.490
techniques and the tools that
are used to bad thing

247
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:29.910
to do bad things in
order to help your security

248
00:13:30.780 --> 00:13:34.110
team. So a lot of
things will get advertised as

249
00:13:34.110 --> 00:13:37.650
ethical hacking just from the
mindset of knowing that the

250
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.680
average person is when they
hear hacker, always thinks like,

251
00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:45.300
you know, anonymous or, or
some bad entity doing something.

252
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.580
Okay. And this is just
where they hear that term

253
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:51.120
white hat versus black, Right?
So like a lot of

254
00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:53.760
people aren't familiar with that,
right? So white hat, black

255
00:13:53.760 --> 00:13:56.310
hat, gray hat. There's like
what? There's a gray hat.

256
00:13:56.580 --> 00:13:58.980
Tell me about the hats.
All right. So now white

257
00:13:58.980 --> 00:14:03.300
hats are, are people who
considered to do hacking for

258
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:06.360
legitimate purposes, right there. They
may work on a security

259
00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:10.680
team or some assessment team,
and they are hacking something,

260
00:14:10.780 --> 00:14:13.050
an organization because they have
been authorized to do it.

261
00:14:13.650 --> 00:14:17.970
And they're trying to improve
that security posture, black hats

262
00:14:17.970 --> 00:14:20.820
are the people who do
things for profit, right? For,

263
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.030
cause they, they want to
hack things because through cool

264
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:29.970
or whatever, and they have
malicious intent generally. And then

265
00:14:29.970 --> 00:14:33.930
there's great hats who are
somewhere in the middle and

266
00:14:34.230 --> 00:14:38.370
they may, let's say they
may hack something for, because

267
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:39.870
they want to, you know,
they're just curious about it.

268
00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.300
But then they say, Hey,
you know, if you want

269
00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.930
the, they'll tell an organization
we've hacked this, but no,

270
00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:48.510
we'll fix it for you.
Quote or, or we'll tell

271
00:14:48.510 --> 00:14:50.070
you how it was done.
If you pay us or

272
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:56.240
something like that is there's
a pretty thin line with

273
00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.900
what is known as gray
hat hacking. Generally speaking, the

274
00:14:59.900 --> 00:15:03.320
majority of people will fall
into white or black hat

275
00:15:03.320 --> 00:15:07.930
hacking. No one wants to
manage databases. If they can

276
00:15:07.930 --> 00:15:12.640
avoid it. That's why Mongo
DB made Mongo DB Atlas,

277
00:15:12.970 --> 00:15:17.080
a global cloud database service
that runs on AWS, GCP

278
00:15:17.080 --> 00:15:20.830
and Azure. You can deploy
a fully managed Mongo DB

279
00:15:20.830 --> 00:15:23.890
database in minutes with just
a few clicks or a

280
00:15:23.890 --> 00:15:29.140
few API calls, Mongo DB,
Atlas, automates deployment, automates updates,

281
00:15:29.170 --> 00:15:31.930
handles scaling, and more so
that you can focus on

282
00:15:31.930 --> 00:15:35.740
your application instead of taking
care of your database, you

283
00:15:35.740 --> 00:15:41.830
can get started free@mongodb.com slash
Atlas. Now, if you're already

284
00:15:41.830 --> 00:15:45.490
managing a Mongo DB deployment,
Atlas has a live migration

285
00:15:45.490 --> 00:15:49.120
service, so you can migrate
it easily with minimal downtime

286
00:15:49.120 --> 00:15:51.670
and then get back to
what matters. Stop managing your

287
00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:57.940
database and start using Mongo
DB Atlas. When then forgive

288
00:15:57.940 --> 00:15:59.980
me for asking ignorant questions.
That's kind of my super

289
00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.820
power is asking dumb questions,
but as a developer who

290
00:16:03.820 --> 00:16:06.220
has a good understanding of
programming, a good understanding of

291
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.680
computer architecture, somewhat good understanding
of networking. My, but I'm

292
00:16:11.680 --> 00:16:13.870
not a surely I'm not
a hacker. I'm not a

293
00:16:13.870 --> 00:16:16.720
cyber cybersecurity expert. I have
only the basic understandings of

294
00:16:16.720 --> 00:16:20.440
like, yeah, you know, ports
and the TCP IP and

295
00:16:20.440 --> 00:16:25.540
blah, blah, blah, are our
most, you know, cyber professionals

296
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:29.290
more, most, you know, hackers
or red team penetration, testers

297
00:16:29.290 --> 00:16:32.320
like yourself. Are you a
super set? Are you all

298
00:16:32.710 --> 00:16:35.470
really great developers that can
write really great code and

299
00:16:35.470 --> 00:16:38.170
Python and C and C
plus plus, or are there

300
00:16:38.170 --> 00:16:41.110
different levels? What's the skill
set? Cause I'm imagining that

301
00:16:41.110 --> 00:16:43.540
someone is listening to this
and wondering what your job

302
00:16:43.570 --> 00:16:46.240
is. Do you do everything
that a developer does? Plus

303
00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:50.200
you have deep knowledge of
security and network architecture. Like

304
00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:51.490
it seems like you have
to be really good at

305
00:16:51.490 --> 00:16:53.590
a lot of stuff to
be able to do this

306
00:16:53.590 --> 00:16:56.590
job. So that's a sensitive
question for a lot of

307
00:16:56.590 --> 00:17:00.310
people in the community. A
lot of people will tell

308
00:17:00.310 --> 00:17:02.920
you that you don't need
to understand programming at all

309
00:17:03.130 --> 00:17:06.430
right. In order to be
accurate, or I should say,

310
00:17:06.910 --> 00:17:09.310
Through a penetration test or
security professional. Yeah. A lot

311
00:17:09.310 --> 00:17:12.580
of people will say that,
but it's generally accepted that

312
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.500
you should have some programming
knowledge. You should be able

313
00:17:14.500 --> 00:17:16.870
to read something, right. You
should know if you're using

314
00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:19.060
the tool, what that tool
does, and you should read

315
00:17:19.090 --> 00:17:21.790
the code of that tool
and say, yup, I can

316
00:17:21.790 --> 00:17:24.400
modify this. If I, if
I need to do something,

317
00:17:25.210 --> 00:17:29.200
it's a beneficial skill to
have. A lot of people

318
00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:32.020
will say, it's not required
because, because you know, pen

319
00:17:32.020 --> 00:17:34.720
testing and red teaming covers
such a variety of fields

320
00:17:35.170 --> 00:17:38.290
that not every fields needs
to, to know how to

321
00:17:38.290 --> 00:17:41.890
do something like that. Right?
So for example, the ICS

322
00:17:41.890 --> 00:17:44.970
industry may have a different
set of expectations for this

323
00:17:44.970 --> 00:17:48.670
skill sets might be then,
you know, the traditional on

324
00:17:48.670 --> 00:17:52.410
premises, red teaming or pen
testing. And even that skill

325
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.780
set may be different from
a lot of the cloud

326
00:17:55.050 --> 00:17:59.670
pen testing. So I wouldn't
say that everyone's a subset

327
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.090
of development or everyone has
the skills that a developer

328
00:18:03.090 --> 00:18:06.500
has. Like I can't write
front end frameworks, like from

329
00:18:06.500 --> 00:18:09.120
my life. Right. I'm terrible
at it. If you ask

330
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:12.900
me to look@somethingand.net, I'll be
like, okay, I guess like,

331
00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:14.430
I know what I'm looking
at because I'm familiar with

332
00:18:14.430 --> 00:18:19.890
like object oriented code, but
generally speaking, there's no real

333
00:18:19.890 --> 00:18:23.130
requirement to be able to
understand that that level of,

334
00:18:23.190 --> 00:18:27.810
of developer life cycle kind
of deal and the majority

335
00:18:27.810 --> 00:18:30.810
of things that they think,
you know, but it's, it's

336
00:18:30.810 --> 00:18:34.100
highly recommended skill to have.
Right. And I assume that

337
00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:36.350
there's different kinds of folks.
I mean, there's network penetration

338
00:18:36.350 --> 00:18:39.320
testing. There's working on, you
know, various cloud, whether it

339
00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:42.050
be the Azure cloud or
other, other third party clouds,

340
00:18:42.230 --> 00:18:45.230
which is different work than,
than like local fuzz testing

341
00:18:45.230 --> 00:18:48.500
or trying to break out
of a security sandbox within

342
00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:50.750
the context of an operating
system, which are all different

343
00:18:50.750 --> 00:18:53.630
skills that may or may
not require different levels of

344
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:57.650
expertise. For sure. So like
you would expect that, and

345
00:18:57.650 --> 00:19:00.470
maybe this is just from
my experience saying this, but

346
00:19:00.470 --> 00:19:02.900
like a web app pen
tester is going to have

347
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:05.810
a completely different skillset than
a network pen tester. And

348
00:19:05.840 --> 00:19:08.870
the web app pen tester
may have, may need to

349
00:19:08.870 --> 00:19:14.240
have a better knowledge of,
of web technologies, PHP, asp.net

350
00:19:14.240 --> 00:19:16.760
core or whatever it's called.
See, I don't remember. Yeah.

351
00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.410
But it's, you don't need
to because that's not the

352
00:19:18.410 --> 00:19:23.240
point. Right? Exactly. So everyone
will have their, there's some

353
00:19:23.240 --> 00:19:28.190
level of quote development skillset
as it pertains to their

354
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:31.250
job. But there's no overall
thing that says you need

355
00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:34.070
to have this, but you
should be able to read

356
00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:37.310
stuff at a minimum. They
can write something in a

357
00:19:37.310 --> 00:19:38.990
language. That's cool. I can't
write in Java, but I

358
00:19:38.990 --> 00:19:41.630
can read through Java. Well,
that's interesting. So if you

359
00:19:41.630 --> 00:19:45.620
joined the asp.net core team,
you've got the, the base

360
00:19:45.620 --> 00:19:47.990
of the pyramid of the
stuff that you need to

361
00:19:47.990 --> 00:19:50.360
know. Right. And then it
would be expected that you

362
00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:52.310
would then apply the things
that you already know and

363
00:19:52.310 --> 00:19:55.970
the professional skills that you
have with an internal knowledge

364
00:19:55.970 --> 00:19:59.510
of, of asp.net, just as,
when you joined the Azure

365
00:19:59.510 --> 00:20:01.490
web team, I assume you,
weren't an Azure expert, you

366
00:20:01.490 --> 00:20:04.070
were a pen testing expert,
and then you gain that

367
00:20:04.070 --> 00:20:06.860
knowledge. Right? So like when
I, when I got this

368
00:20:06.860 --> 00:20:10.310
shot by little to no
knowledge of Azure, like someone

369
00:20:10.310 --> 00:20:12.020
mentioned blob storage to me,
I was like, what's that

370
00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.430
right? But my experience with
the network side of things

371
00:20:16.430 --> 00:20:19.730
and like on premises stuff,
kind of put me in

372
00:20:19.730 --> 00:20:23.210
a position where I can
easily adjust to the things

373
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:27.980
that were required for Azure
or red teaming. Hmm. That

374
00:20:27.980 --> 00:20:29.120
makes sense. And if I
were going to go and

375
00:20:29.120 --> 00:20:30.980
work for WordPress and to
your job, then I would

376
00:20:30.980 --> 00:20:35.270
be expected to become a
WordPress expert, I think a

377
00:20:35.590 --> 00:20:39.080
fairly good understanding. Right. So
in your, your example that

378
00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:41.420
you just gave with asp.net
core, right. If you were

379
00:20:41.420 --> 00:20:44.030
a developer who worked on
that and you wanted to

380
00:20:44.030 --> 00:20:47.440
move in the security portion,
well, maybe you, well, you

381
00:20:47.440 --> 00:20:51.100
should have an understanding of
like the do's and don'ts

382
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.610
of, of programming in that
language. Right. Right. And being

383
00:20:54.610 --> 00:20:57.580
able to understand that if
you do certain things, or

384
00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.160
if you configure things certain
way, here's how we're gonna

385
00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:03.300
attack it. Maybe able to
get to it. So if

386
00:21:03.300 --> 00:21:06.900
someone wants to get to
get your job and work

387
00:21:06.900 --> 00:21:08.760
in this space that you're
working in, I noticed that

388
00:21:08.760 --> 00:21:12.120
you spent over a decade
in the Navy. Did that

389
00:21:12.150 --> 00:21:14.370
set you up for success
in this kind of work?

390
00:21:14.370 --> 00:21:15.810
Or is that a coincidence
or is it just that

391
00:21:15.810 --> 00:21:18.780
the Navy has a very
strong cryptology community? I would

392
00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:21.690
definitely say that I would
not be here if it

393
00:21:21.690 --> 00:21:23.760
were not for that time
that I spent in the

394
00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:26.550
Navy, before I joined the
Navy, I was gonna do

395
00:21:26.550 --> 00:21:28.830
like a, I want it
to be like a video

396
00:21:28.830 --> 00:21:32.670
game composer, you know, that
was my goal. Right. That

397
00:21:32.670 --> 00:21:34.530
is a different job than
you have right now. Yeah.

398
00:21:34.530 --> 00:21:37.440
I still do both though,
I guess. Yeah, I could,

399
00:21:38.130 --> 00:21:42.180
but it's it like that,
that was my high school,

400
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:44.910
my goal coming out of
high school. Right. I didn't

401
00:21:44.910 --> 00:21:47.190
really have good grades, so
I couldn't really go to

402
00:21:47.190 --> 00:21:50.790
college that easy. So I
joined the Navy and then

403
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.090
I was doing electronics and
I was like, I was

404
00:21:54.090 --> 00:21:56.220
going to get out at
my six year Mark. I

405
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:58.110
was going to go to
college and get like a

406
00:21:58.110 --> 00:22:02.730
degree in, in biometric engineering
and something like that. And

407
00:22:02.730 --> 00:22:05.190
I was like, this opportunity
came up to like move

408
00:22:05.190 --> 00:22:07.860
to like the cryptologic field.
And I was like, all

409
00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.610
right, well, I'll give it
a chance. And then if

410
00:22:11.610 --> 00:22:14.070
I don't like it, or
if some other thing comes

411
00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.420
up, then I'll just get
out. And my 10 year

412
00:22:15.420 --> 00:22:18.420
Mark, and that's what I
did. So I moved over

413
00:22:18.420 --> 00:22:22.800
to cryptologic field for four
years and then I got

414
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.890
out and I was like,
I really want to be

415
00:22:25.890 --> 00:22:29.100
a pen tester or a
teamer. It took me that

416
00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:30.660
long to figure out what
I really wanted to do,

417
00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:35.190
but for sure, I am
glad that I am here

418
00:22:36.750 --> 00:22:39.360
When someone wants to get
started. I see a lot

419
00:22:39.360 --> 00:22:41.400
of certificates. Right? You said
that there's like one of

420
00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:43.170
the certificates that I pointed
out was a very basic

421
00:22:43.170 --> 00:22:45.810
certificate. It's like the base
of the pyramid should show

422
00:22:45.870 --> 00:22:48.720
people who are interested in
security as a professional career,

423
00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:51.120
collect all their certificates. Or
is there one that is

424
00:22:51.120 --> 00:22:54.060
more important than another or
one degree or one background?

425
00:22:54.270 --> 00:22:56.040
Like how does one prove
themselves and put it on

426
00:22:56.040 --> 00:22:58.680
a resume other than saying,
I'm the one that broke

427
00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:02.640
into whatever, you know, That
is also a matter of

428
00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:07.410
perspective. I really like controversial
topic. Some people will say

429
00:23:07.530 --> 00:23:09.810
you don't need any certs
at all. And they'll talk

430
00:23:09.810 --> 00:23:12.510
about their experience coming out
of high school and now

431
00:23:12.510 --> 00:23:17.370
being a prominent individual in
the community with no degree

432
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:22.740
and no certs, but everyone
experiences varies. I know that

433
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:24.840
I had a difficult time
getting a job when I

434
00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:27.480
was getting out, even with
all, all those certs listed.

435
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.690
And it was a combination
of things really, but everyone's

436
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:34.560
experience is different. So I
would say that, sir, certainly

437
00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:37.230
generally seen, as you might
have the knowledge to do

438
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:41.430
something, you might, but you
have the potential to learn.

439
00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:45.770
So I, I would never
like say don't get, and

440
00:23:45.770 --> 00:23:48.290
I think everyone should have
certs, particularly if you're trying

441
00:23:48.290 --> 00:23:51.560
to be like marketable, but
a lot of people out

442
00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:54.350
there will say that none
are required and more power

443
00:23:54.350 --> 00:23:57.260
to them. If I were
looking for a job now,

444
00:23:57.290 --> 00:24:00.140
I'd, I'd probably try to
find certs that were relevant

445
00:24:00.200 --> 00:24:03.640
to that position just to
make them okay. So it

446
00:24:03.640 --> 00:24:05.500
sounds like search, aren't the
magic thing that one needs

447
00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.060
to get where it's like,
Oh yeah, well, you know,

448
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:09.760
he's got the cert, so
we'll hire this person. It's,

449
00:24:09.790 --> 00:24:11.170
it's not, it's not like
that. Any of the cert

450
00:24:11.590 --> 00:24:13.450
it's something to study for
it, something to focus on.

451
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:15.100
It's a goal. It might
be a hurdle that they

452
00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.610
want you to get, but
it's not the a, the

453
00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:20.560
necessarily of the stamp book
to fill. Yeah. The biggest

454
00:24:20.560 --> 00:24:22.900
problem is, is that like
HR departments will put out,

455
00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:25.390
we want these particular circuits.
And even if you are

456
00:24:25.390 --> 00:24:28.450
qualified without those certs, it
may be difficult to get

457
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.920
past that HR wall. But
if you were to network

458
00:24:33.430 --> 00:24:36.580
with people directly and talk
to people, then you probably

459
00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.400
have a better chance getting
a position by networking with

460
00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:42.340
people than you would just
having a certificate and trying

461
00:24:42.340 --> 00:24:47.380
to send me your resume.
Interesting. Is there a, a

462
00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:50.560
degree or a, a badge
or a thing that one

463
00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:52.780
gets where you go, Oh
wow. This person means business.

464
00:24:52.780 --> 00:24:54.430
They work for the Navy
or they got that cert

465
00:24:54.430 --> 00:24:56.380
or they got that degree,
or this is the school,

466
00:24:56.830 --> 00:24:59.380
or is it really just
a very diverse community with

467
00:24:59.410 --> 00:25:02.800
lots of different things that
one could potentially do? I

468
00:25:02.800 --> 00:25:05.680
would like to say that
there isn't, but typically what

469
00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:09.610
you find is that people
value OCP to a degree,

470
00:25:10.990 --> 00:25:15.340
the offensive security certified professional.
I remember when Scott There's

471
00:25:15.340 --> 00:25:17.800
like, Oh, C O S
C O S C P

472
00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:19.660
and O S WP. There's
a bunch of those, but

473
00:25:19.660 --> 00:25:23.980
they're all offensive security, something,
something, Right. And some, and

474
00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.650
people will take that as
a indication of, you know,

475
00:25:26.650 --> 00:25:29.530
OCP is really hard. If
you were able to pass

476
00:25:29.530 --> 00:25:31.840
it, then it shows that
you have a certain aptitude

477
00:25:32.590 --> 00:25:35.560
level and the ability to
study for yourself and, and

478
00:25:35.560 --> 00:25:39.130
all that stuff. And so
like, that's generally how that

479
00:25:39.130 --> 00:25:42.790
certificate is viewed. But honestly,
the other side of that

480
00:25:42.790 --> 00:25:46.030
is that OCP is also
sort of viewed as a

481
00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.120
beginner pen tester cert, right.
Or be in a red

482
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.580
team or insert because there's
so much that it doesn't

483
00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:56.140
cover. That's modern now where
a lot of companies like

484
00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:58.900
moving to cloud environments, for
example, right. That is uncovered.

485
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:03.550
And so like while OCP
may be that, that thing

486
00:26:03.550 --> 00:26:05.230
that people are like, yeah,
I'm going to get that

487
00:26:05.230 --> 00:26:07.990
and put that on my
resume. It's not really indication

488
00:26:07.990 --> 00:26:10.720
of skill, but more of
indication of you were able

489
00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:13.480
to accomplish something by putting
the time into it. That's

490
00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:15.670
how I view it. I
know people would disagree with

491
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:17.020
me. I can think of
names off the top of

492
00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.200
my head. People would have
issue with me saying that,

493
00:26:20.200 --> 00:26:24.460
but that's how I view.
So it's like that. Well,

494
00:26:24.460 --> 00:26:27.220
it seems reasonable. I think
certs certs are definitely a,

495
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.890
a, a point of contention
because they can be used

496
00:26:29.900 --> 00:26:33.670
to really mean something and
really say something. But, and

497
00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:35.920
to others, they just seem
like an arbitrary hurdle that

498
00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.960
someone puts in front of
someone in order to, you

499
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.550
know, say this is a
thing we value, here's a

500
00:26:39.550 --> 00:26:43.090
gatekeeping bit of motion that
we're doing, but it sounds

501
00:26:43.110 --> 00:26:45.030
like there is a lot
of value in some of

502
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.250
them and they are the
standards. So they certainly can't

503
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.060
hurt to have a surgeon.
Right. Yeah, exactly. So if

504
00:26:50.060 --> 00:26:53.450
you have the ability or
the money to get one,

505
00:26:53.510 --> 00:26:56.390
I would for sure get
one, there are some really

506
00:26:56.390 --> 00:26:59.120
expensive certs out there, but
That's a good point too.

507
00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:02.500
Sometimes they're a racket because
they cost so much. Yeah.

508
00:27:02.510 --> 00:27:05.870
I, I, I would say
that there are definitely some

509
00:27:05.870 --> 00:27:09.830
certs that have training that
could be provided at alternatively

510
00:27:10.790 --> 00:27:12.740
and, and a lot of
those are seen as, you

511
00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:17.330
know, major, major certifications, but
you can definitely get the

512
00:27:17.330 --> 00:27:20.480
knowledge for those certs at
a cheaper price without, but

513
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.000
you probably wouldn't get the
recognition from like HR, for

514
00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.700
example. Okay. All right. So
let me pivot a little

515
00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:27.260
bit and ask a dumb
question that I've always wanted

516
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.350
to ask somebody when you're
watching, you know, how as

517
00:27:30.350 --> 00:27:32.180
a programmer, when I watch
a TV show and they

518
00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:35.660
do something super dumb where
it's like four people on

519
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.930
one keyboard, or like the
person's got like a nine

520
00:27:39.410 --> 00:27:42.050
on a grid of nine
monitors and he's like, you

521
00:27:42.050 --> 00:27:46.580
know, minority report or whatever,
have you ever watched a

522
00:27:46.580 --> 00:27:49.610
show and seen a real
security moment and gone like,

523
00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:51.890
Oh yeah. I felt like
that once. That was exactly

524
00:27:51.890 --> 00:27:56.210
when I broke into whatever,
I can't say that I've

525
00:27:56.210 --> 00:27:58.790
seen, like, I haven't fully
watched dr. Robot, for example,

526
00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:02.390
mr. Robot, Oh, you missed
the robot yet. I saw

527
00:28:02.390 --> 00:28:05.570
the first season and I
haven't watched the other seasons.

528
00:28:06.140 --> 00:28:09.440
Generally. What I'll see are
things like don't make sense.

529
00:28:09.770 --> 00:28:12.170
And I think that that's
just the nature of people

530
00:28:12.560 --> 00:28:14.240
or whatever job you work.
When you see something on

531
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.670
TV, that's not right. Or
it's not consistent with what

532
00:28:16.670 --> 00:28:18.680
you do. Like, you kind
of put that out more

533
00:28:18.680 --> 00:28:21.830
than, Oh, man, this is
actually like the legitimate, a

534
00:28:21.830 --> 00:28:24.440
legitimate thing that you can
do. So when it comes

535
00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:26.960
to it, security stuff, most
people get it wrong. And

536
00:28:26.960 --> 00:28:28.520
that's because they want to
keep things at such like

537
00:28:28.530 --> 00:28:32.930
a, either a dramatic feel
or like a layman's terms

538
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:36.230
that, you know, the, the
ACARS don't know theirs. They're

539
00:28:36.230 --> 00:28:39.530
saying they're just repeating words.
And they're like, they may

540
00:28:39.530 --> 00:28:42.170
sound somewhere. Yeah. It's like
my wife's a nurse. And

541
00:28:42.170 --> 00:28:44.540
she's just like, somebody like
give me a CBC chem

542
00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.130
seven and dip a urine
stat. And she's like, what

543
00:28:46.130 --> 00:28:50.810
are they? Even thing it
is memorize that. And always,

544
00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:53.000
somebody always ends up stabbing
somebody in the neck with

545
00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.280
a pen to do something.
I don't know why they're

546
00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.380
choking or they can't breathe.
Stab them in the neck

547
00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.900
with a pen. I'm always
ready to do that at

548
00:28:59.900 --> 00:29:05.030
any moment. If anybody needs
pen next step, make sure

549
00:29:05.030 --> 00:29:07.550
to stay far away, watch
out for me. Have you

550
00:29:07.550 --> 00:29:09.980
ever, well, let me ask
you this. Have you ever

551
00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:13.190
had a moment where you
did succeed, where you broke

552
00:29:13.190 --> 00:29:14.960
in, where you did something
you're just at the command

553
00:29:14.960 --> 00:29:18.380
line it's whatever. And you'd
like, just put your hands

554
00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:20.030
up in the air. You're
like, I got it. I

555
00:29:20.030 --> 00:29:21.680
did it. I had that.
You had that moment. I

556
00:29:21.690 --> 00:29:23.900
may not necessarily be cinematic,
but it was a hands

557
00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:26.450
up in the air pen
testing moment. Oh yeah, that

558
00:29:26.450 --> 00:29:29.810
happened yesterday. Real. Okay. Give
me that. That's our, that's

559
00:29:29.810 --> 00:29:31.880
our closing moment for the
podcast. Tell me about that.

560
00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.660
In generic terms, I spent
the last week doing things

561
00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:39.440
that I've never done before.
Nice. And trying out a

562
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:45.970
different approach to gaining access.
And when it worked, I

563
00:29:45.970 --> 00:29:47.560
just kind of sat there,
like I got out of

564
00:29:47.560 --> 00:29:49.240
my seat and like, I,
nobody else is in my

565
00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.640
apartment. Right. Yeah. I have
totally done that. I have

566
00:29:54.640 --> 00:29:57.850
literally like stood up, turned
around and be like, and

567
00:29:57.850 --> 00:30:00.100
then like, no one else
is around me. And like,

568
00:30:00.130 --> 00:30:03.160
no one cares that I
did that. There's absolutely those,

569
00:30:03.190 --> 00:30:05.110
especially when you've been working
at it, like all day

570
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.150
and trying to figure things
out there, there's always that

571
00:30:07.150 --> 00:30:11.290
moment of yes. And then
either the immediate reaction is,

572
00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:13.960
all right, let me keep
going. Or let me go,

573
00:30:14.230 --> 00:30:18.850
go take a nap. I'm
imagining, I want to see

574
00:30:18.850 --> 00:30:21.490
the movie that about your
life, where you like jump

575
00:30:21.490 --> 00:30:22.990
up in the middle of
the night in your apartment.

576
00:30:22.990 --> 00:30:25.330
And you're like, all right.
And now for snacks, you

577
00:30:25.330 --> 00:30:27.310
know, I've just broken into
the thing and now I'm

578
00:30:27.310 --> 00:30:29.740
going to take a nap
and that's on the price

579
00:30:29.740 --> 00:30:34.360
of turnips. Literally what happens
right afterwards? That was my

580
00:30:34.360 --> 00:30:37.810
fantastic, well, thank you so
much for chatting with me

581
00:30:37.810 --> 00:30:40.900
today, for sure. I appreciate
you having me. I've been

582
00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.540
chatting with Lauren Gray from the
Azure red team at Microsoft.

583
00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:46.450
And this has been another
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll

584
00:30:46.450 --> 00:30:47.650
see you again next week.
