is Scott Hanselman. This is

9
00:00:43.010 --> 00:00:46.850
Hansel mint today. I'm talking
with dr. Frazier shin engineering,

10
00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.360
The manager at Intel corporation,
and you worked on the

11
00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:52.340
space shuttle. You've done it.
You have got the most

12
00:00:52.340 --> 00:00:55.280
amazing LinkedIn. I am just
enjoying reading your LinkedIn and

13
00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.100
that is not something I
can say about everybody. Oh,

14
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:00.230
well, thank you, Scott. I
appreciate it. Thank you very

15
00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:02.480
much for having me on.
No, it's absolutely my pleasure.

16
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:04.520
It must be pretty exciting
to get to work on

17
00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:08.810
kind of two of the
main technological improvements of the

18
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:11.300
20th and early 21st century,
the space shuttle and then

19
00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:15.770
semiconductor. Yeah. Yeah. Most definitely.
I can't lie. I pretty

20
00:01:15.770 --> 00:01:18.560
much won the lottery in
that regard and working for

21
00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:22.760
the most complex technical challenges
that human kind is working

22
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.910
on. You know, I think
the spatial itself was a

23
00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.390
call, one of the most
complex, you know, engineering efforts

24
00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:32.390
at the time, you know,
and then now you have

25
00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:35.540
semiconductors with the lower complexity
it gets to, as you

26
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:39.350
get smaller and smaller and
then supercomputers themselves or, or

27
00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:44.150
entire systems that have complexity,
you know, approaching, but not

28
00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:45.980
quite that level, but you
know, getting close closer to

29
00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:48.860
things like aerospace or medical
or stuff like that. So,

30
00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.260
yeah, it's really, really cool.
So your undergrad is an

31
00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:54.980
aerospace engineering and then your
master's was in mechanical engineering

32
00:01:54.980 --> 00:01:58.130
with a specialization on thermal
and fluid sciences. And then

33
00:01:58.130 --> 00:02:01.370
you got a PhD in
mechanical engineering is mechanical engineering.

34
00:02:01.670 --> 00:02:04.670
It's a pretty big wide
open field. Do you have

35
00:02:04.670 --> 00:02:09.770
a specialization within mechanical engineering?
Yeah, I would say my

36
00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.390
specialization for like a master's
level was more of the

37
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:19.250
shock waves looking at heat
transfer, particularly heat transfer, and

38
00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:23.780
the shock shock to test
apparatus is it long test

39
00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:27.620
times, which we use to
characterize chemical reactions over a

40
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.000
certain period of time to
see what the, the derivative

41
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.720
chemical reactions are. And then
as I got to my

42
00:02:35.720 --> 00:02:39.980
doctorate, my specialization was on
the combustion side of salt,

43
00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:44.630
rocket propellant, specifically at the
modeling of them with nano

44
00:02:44.630 --> 00:02:49.310
catalytic additives. So I've got
your thesis open here and

45
00:02:49.310 --> 00:02:52.340
I, I read it to
the best of my community

46
00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.610
college degree. And one of
the things that struck me

47
00:02:55.610 --> 00:03:01.810
is that you're exploring how
perchlorate Behaves and is the

48
00:03:01.810 --> 00:03:04.960
goal here to make it
burn hotter and faster and

49
00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:06.670
increased the rate of the
burn so that it has

50
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:09.520
more explosiveness and then takes
the space shuttle up faster.

51
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.380
Yeah. And, you know, for
the special or program, they

52
00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:17.490
have their special blend, which
is fairly standard with ammonia

53
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.050
perchlorate and the, the know
iron oxides and, you know,

54
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.230
a little bit of aluminum
to help train it and

55
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.940
then their, their, their fuel.
But in the case of

56
00:03:29.970 --> 00:03:33.480
what we were studying in
that research is use a

57
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:37.140
lot for things like maybe
missile research, you know, where

58
00:03:37.140 --> 00:03:40.770
you have certain rockets or,
you know, some sort of

59
00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:44.010
propel body with a solid
propellant. And you're, you're trying

60
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:47.640
to get to perform in
certain regimes where maybe it

61
00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:52.230
has a very high burn
rate, like really fast, like

62
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.200
you were saying, but I
can get, you know, make

63
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:56.610
to a target faster or
something of that nature. Or

64
00:03:56.610 --> 00:03:58.780
sometimes you may want to
see what the effect of

65
00:03:58.780 --> 00:04:03.270
a nano attitude could be
some metal oxide to maybe

66
00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:06.150
make it burn longer over
a longer period of time

67
00:04:06.150 --> 00:04:08.910
or maybe slower. And then
there's other regimes that get

68
00:04:08.910 --> 00:04:11.850
very interesting, like Mesa burning,
where it maybe it'll burn

69
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:14.910
really fast and hot and
they kind of flatten out

70
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:19.500
in his burn rate and
then maybe the decrease or

71
00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.760
an intermittent situation where it
burns hot and fast. And

72
00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.010
then suddenly it kind of
stops for a second because

73
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:29.220
of maybe some of the,
the, how, the way that

74
00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:32.510
geometry is changing or some
of the, the way that

75
00:04:32.510 --> 00:04:34.950
the fluid properties are working
on the propeller ads is

76
00:04:34.950 --> 00:04:37.260
actually burning it. So it
kind of stops for a

77
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:40.530
second and it starts again.
So these are all different

78
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:44.160
things that the military uses
for whatever application they may

79
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:46.260
be using it for the,
which I would not know,

80
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:50.460
but they find it interesting
indeed. Well, I think we've

81
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:54.270
all been at a cookout
or at a campfire and

82
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:58.050
we've burned a wood and
then sprayed it with something

83
00:04:58.050 --> 00:04:59.730
we shouldn't have had it
shouldn't have sprayed it with

84
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:01.500
like an accelerant to go
in, you know, make the

85
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.520
barbecue go faster. But mostly
that just kind of makes

86
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:08.610
the fire go. And then
we go, wow, that was

87
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.170
interesting. But, but you're describing
not just how things burn,

88
00:05:13.180 --> 00:05:15.840
but how they burn over
time with, and I assume

89
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:18.540
the goal is to be
able to have control, right?

90
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.490
You don't want to just
light something on fire and

91
00:05:20.490 --> 00:05:23.880
then just hope for the
best. Exactly. You pretty much

92
00:05:23.910 --> 00:05:27.120
nailed in, in a much
simpler explanation in novice providing

93
00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:29.640
earlier. It's, it's, they're, they're
looking for a way to

94
00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:32.640
control the burn rate because
the thing about a solid

95
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.430
propellant versus a liquid one,
like you were just describing,

96
00:05:35.430 --> 00:05:37.290
you know, in a fire
and you squirt, you know,

97
00:05:37.590 --> 00:05:41.100
gasoline or something on it,
you know, that's control you

98
00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:43.470
throttled that by, you know,
how much you're squeezing and

99
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:46.440
pressing or whatever the case
may be, right? Much like

100
00:05:46.440 --> 00:05:51.330
the solid space shuttles, external
tank with the liquid propellant

101
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:55.170
that that comes through, but
a solid propel it once

102
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.160
you like that, it's pretty
much going, you know, you

103
00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.170
can't really stop it until
it pretty much burns out.

104
00:06:00.470 --> 00:06:03.080
And so the idea is
how do we control the

105
00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:05.990
burn rate of a solid
propellant in a rocket, but

106
00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:10.550
at the same time have,
do do so with just

107
00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:13.490
whatever the propellant itself is
or the properties or the

108
00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:16.910
design is shaped with a
motor itself without having to

109
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:20.390
actually introduce any other mechanisms
that can try to, you

110
00:06:20.390 --> 00:06:23.570
know, fucking motor design or
stuff like that to control

111
00:06:23.570 --> 00:06:27.160
the brain rate or some
unique device <inaudible> is solid

112
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:29.980
propellant in a rocket solid
because we want it to

113
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.700
be very dense and have
more like, you know, the,

114
00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:35.740
the amount of space that
it occupies versus the amount

115
00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:38.680
of potential power that it
represents, or why is it

116
00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.420
solid? Why isn't it just
liquid? Yeah. Well, there's multiple

117
00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.260
reasons. There's what you can
pack into it, the density

118
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.770
like you were saying, but
there's also a shelf life.

119
00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:54.040
So when you have a
solid repellent, in fact, a

120
00:06:54.040 --> 00:06:57.940
good example is your airbags
in your car, right? How

121
00:06:57.940 --> 00:07:00.520
it deploys quickly and fast,
you know, when an accident

122
00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.440
happens and the little igniter,
you know, goes off that

123
00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:08.410
causes the gut to burn
very fast and it fill

124
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:13.240
up the air back with
all the expunged gases, that

125
00:07:13.240 --> 00:07:17.380
ability to store that, that
propellant somewhere on the shelf

126
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.750
for years at a time,
and then have it still

127
00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.170
work as part of the
benefit. Oh my goodness. How

128
00:07:23.170 --> 00:07:26.980
do people practice this though?
If you've got something that's

129
00:07:26.980 --> 00:07:31.420
burning it, I don't know,
1400 Kelvin, how do you

130
00:07:31.690 --> 00:07:34.450
experiment with this? And how
are the people who did

131
00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:40.840
the experiments? Not all dead.
Great question, very carefully. It's,

132
00:07:40.930 --> 00:07:45.160
it's amazing. Even, even as
a, a, a, you know,

133
00:07:45.220 --> 00:07:48.880
a college student you're going
through, you know, alcohol, tobacco

134
00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:52.990
and firearms training, you know,
about how to handle this

135
00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:57.640
stuff. Right. Really. Yeah. In
fact, there's, you know, sidebar,

136
00:07:57.640 --> 00:08:02.110
whenever you get a chance,
maybe Google Petco disaster, but

137
00:08:02.110 --> 00:08:05.800
Petco was a place that
was a chemical plant that

138
00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:11.230
had ammonia perchlorate stored within
his various, you know, storage

139
00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:14.680
areas. And it didn't do
a good job of keeping

140
00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:18.010
it clean. And so there
was like, you know, particulate

141
00:08:18.070 --> 00:08:22.510
dust of ammonia perchlorate around.
Plus they had lots of

142
00:08:22.930 --> 00:08:29.590
canisters and containers underneath a
lot of pressure and ammonia

143
00:08:29.590 --> 00:08:32.230
perchlorate That was in 1998.
And the thing that was

144
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.090
interesting about it was, it
was one of only two

145
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:37.690
places in America that would
produce ammonium perchlorate right. And

146
00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.910
you'd think that if they're
making it, they would know

147
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:42.490
how not to break it.
And in fact, two people

148
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:46.600
died and it costs almost
$200 million in property damage. Horrible,

149
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:50.170
horrible thing. Yeah, Yeah, yeah.
Wow. Yeah. You recall way

150
00:08:50.170 --> 00:08:52.180
more, but at night I
try to do my research

151
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:56.490
when I have PhD's on
the show. Yeah. And it

152
00:08:56.490 --> 00:08:58.440
was just amazing because of
what they, I won't say

153
00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:00.810
they forgot. I'm sure they
didn't forget this, but, you

154
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:04.440
know, there was probably a
degree of, I dunno, vigilance

155
00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.680
in, in safety that maybe
just wasn't followed, but, you

156
00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:09.870
know, ammonia for Clery, it's
just, it's really its own

157
00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:13.860
fuel and oxidizer, and under
a high enough pressure as

158
00:09:13.890 --> 00:09:18.270
experiences, you know, enough temperature
such that it could start

159
00:09:18.270 --> 00:09:20.940
to undergo, you know, this
gasification that will lead to

160
00:09:20.940 --> 00:09:24.660
a combust combustion event. And
so going back to, you

161
00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:28.770
know, us now as students,
you know, we had the

162
00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:33.120
ammonium perchlorate, it is, we
actually had to wear light

163
00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:41.430
lab coats and EMI, or
an EMI electromagnetic discharge, static

164
00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:43.440
discharge. I can remember it's
not any of mine. It's

165
00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:46.230
another acronym is escaping me
right now. We have to

166
00:09:46.230 --> 00:09:49.380
wear special shoes, which are
made by converse. I believe

167
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:51.990
if I recall. So that
was Ascot. Cool. We got

168
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:54.060
wear converse sneakers that were
for like being in the

169
00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.800
lab, but we had to
wear these special shoes to

170
00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.080
make sure we didn't have
any electrical discharge that would

171
00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:04.590
happen and possibly, you know,
make the ammonium perchlorate go

172
00:10:04.590 --> 00:10:08.850
off. We actually had the
lab when it was constructed.

173
00:10:09.150 --> 00:10:10.680
And this is at Texas
a and M at the

174
00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:13.500
turbo machinery lab, just to
get them a, a bit

175
00:10:13.500 --> 00:10:17.070
of a shout. We actually
had to construct the lab

176
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:19.860
and we had to build
in steel, you know, rebar.

177
00:10:20.220 --> 00:10:23.040
And we actually had a
test cell so that all

178
00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.400
the diagnostic, you know, work
that happened on the computer,

179
00:10:26.580 --> 00:10:29.730
taking in the data from
the, the rise in pressure

180
00:10:29.730 --> 00:10:33.960
and temperature, while we would
have the propellant within a,

181
00:10:33.990 --> 00:10:37.890
what we call a strand
bomb, all of that was

182
00:10:37.890 --> 00:10:42.900
behind these reinforced walls, such
that if something did happen,

183
00:10:42.930 --> 00:10:46.490
it wouldn't endanger us. Yeah.
So it was, it was,

184
00:10:46.590 --> 00:10:48.450
it was pretty nice. And
it was funny. We actually

185
00:10:48.450 --> 00:10:53.970
had shock tube testing going
on next door where we

186
00:10:53.970 --> 00:10:58.500
were doing other chemical kinetics
experiments. So it was like,

187
00:10:58.530 --> 00:11:00.990
Hey, you know, there was
a lot of reinforcement going

188
00:11:00.990 --> 00:11:06.060
on, but yeah, it's, it's
a lot of safety protocols,

189
00:11:06.090 --> 00:11:08.550
a lot of making sure
that you're not carrying things

190
00:11:08.820 --> 00:11:11.460
forward and back, and that
you have no static charge

191
00:11:11.460 --> 00:11:14.880
on your body. In some
ways, you know, often we

192
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.220
probably viewed it as overkill
a little bit, but you

193
00:11:17.220 --> 00:11:20.790
know, the smallest thing could
happen. And when that happened,

194
00:11:20.790 --> 00:11:22.560
you know, it, look, you
look back on it and

195
00:11:22.950 --> 00:11:25.400
say, okay, take every precaution
that we need to. Yeah.

196
00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:30.920
Safety first, those, those shoes
are ESD shoes, electrostatic shoes.

197
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:32.720
Yeah. Those are no joke.
It's not just your regular

198
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:34.880
old shoes. You gotta make
sure that they right. They

199
00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.830
have to let that electricity
go into the ground. Right.

200
00:11:36.830 --> 00:11:40.480
You're basically grounding yourself. Yep.
Exactly. In fact, you know,

201
00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:42.320
you had a little tag
and you stick the tech

202
00:11:42.560 --> 00:11:44.180
actually, until I was kind
of the same thing for

203
00:11:44.180 --> 00:11:47.000
the folks who go in
and test the, the different,

204
00:11:47.690 --> 00:11:49.910
the quality of the Silicon
and everything, and run it

205
00:11:49.910 --> 00:11:53.180
through its validation. Now you
made a comment a few

206
00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:56.500
paragraphs ago where you said
that, that the, this ammonia

207
00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:59.500
perchlorate is its own, it's
a fuel and an oxidizer,

208
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:02.650
but then your, your PhD
thesis talks about these additives,

209
00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:05.860
these nano additives. So I
know nano means small, what

210
00:12:05.860 --> 00:12:07.990
kind of small things are
we adding? That's going to

211
00:12:07.990 --> 00:12:11.070
make it better than it
already is. Yeah. So at

212
00:12:11.070 --> 00:12:13.800
the time, I'm not sure
where the research is now,

213
00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:16.770
but at the time we
were adding metal oxides. So

214
00:12:16.770 --> 00:12:23.970
things like Syria or titanium
or titanium oxide, like tiny

215
00:12:23.970 --> 00:12:29.850
pieces of metal. Exactly. Yeah.
And bonded with oxygen. And

216
00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:33.600
basically, you know, these tiny
pieces of metal, the smaller,

217
00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:37.320
smaller you can get, it
creates more of a reaction

218
00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:40.380
site cause you've increased the
surface area upon which different

219
00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:45.240
chemical reactions can occur. Yeah.
So that's, that's the idea

220
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:48.600
of using these, these metal
oxides that the metal piece,

221
00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:50.940
and this is probably going
a little bit super in

222
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:54.330
depth into a level of
chemistry that I don't have,

223
00:12:54.330 --> 00:12:58.440
but you know, the, the,
the metals probably have some

224
00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:04.050
sort of electron level behavior
that helps stimulate chemical reactions

225
00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:08.370
or effectively when, especially when
combined with the, the oxygen,

226
00:13:09.270 --> 00:13:12.510
but the, the size of
these particles are what enable

227
00:13:12.510 --> 00:13:16.770
them to be effective because
when you're able to get

228
00:13:16.770 --> 00:13:21.810
more into the, the chemical
composition of the solid propellant,

229
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:25.380
but then you've got so
many of them around, why

230
00:13:25.380 --> 00:13:28.440
is it creating more reactions?
I just liked almost. Oh

231
00:13:28.470 --> 00:13:30.600
yeah. Because like I was
saying before you, you increase

232
00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:35.010
your surface area. So now
you've got more space available

233
00:13:35.010 --> 00:13:37.650
upon which to actually have
like a cool reaction, which

234
00:13:37.890 --> 00:13:42.510
helps stimulate the, the rate,
the combustion reaction of the

235
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:46.530
propellant, Hey friends, you know
how I love great podcasts.

236
00:13:46.530 --> 00:13:48.600
And I want you to
check out the code newbie

237
00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:52.620
podcasts, all about stories from
folks on their coding journey.

238
00:13:53.220 --> 00:13:56.130
They talked to new developers,
experienced developers and everyone in

239
00:13:56.130 --> 00:13:59.160
between about how they got
started learning to code how

240
00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:02.370
they navigate their technical careers.
And they also do deep

241
00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:06.570
dives into technical topics in
a newbie friendly way, check

242
00:14:06.570 --> 00:14:11.130
out their podcast at www
dot code newbie. That's any

243
00:14:11.130 --> 00:14:20.130
w D I e.org/podcast. That's
code newbie.org/podcast. So you bring

244
00:14:20.130 --> 00:14:22.440
up a really interesting question.
So for those of us

245
00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.980
that are like regular people,
we kind of mythologize PhDs.

246
00:14:25.980 --> 00:14:27.330
Like it's just an amazing
thing that you have such

247
00:14:27.330 --> 00:14:29.670
a deep specialization in a
thing, but that you just,

248
00:14:29.670 --> 00:14:32.520
for example said, well, that,
but that goes farther into

249
00:14:32.520 --> 00:14:36.180
chemistry than your PhD goes
when that's kind of cool.

250
00:14:36.180 --> 00:14:38.640
Like, I just assume you
all know everything, but you're

251
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:40.890
saying that there's a specialization.
Do you then work side

252
00:14:40.890 --> 00:14:43.140
by side with like, with
a, with a, with a

253
00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:46.380
chemistry PhD, and then they,
they, they reached their limit

254
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.140
and then they find a
material sciences, PhD, and then

255
00:14:49.140 --> 00:14:53.270
you all work together. That's
Pretty much it. In fact,

256
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:55.390
when I was doing my
research, there was a, I'm

257
00:14:55.390 --> 00:14:59.300
a material scientist over at
university of central Florida that

258
00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.610
we were working with. And,
you know, and he was

259
00:15:01.610 --> 00:15:05.840
able to look at what
we call it, the agglomeration.

260
00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.340
And basically that's when you're
creating these nanoparticles, you know,

261
00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:13.280
like anything in nature, whether
it's, you know, all, no

262
00:15:13.290 --> 00:15:15.830
rocks and space, they're trying
to come together to form

263
00:15:15.830 --> 00:15:18.740
planets or something else. When
it, when you're trying to

264
00:15:18.740 --> 00:15:21.680
make something super small, it'll
want to have a desire

265
00:15:21.680 --> 00:15:25.430
to come together with other
things, right. And make it

266
00:15:25.430 --> 00:15:27.890
a little bit bigger, but
you don't want that because

267
00:15:27.890 --> 00:15:30.860
the larger you size, you
get the less reaction sites

268
00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:36.110
you have. So with his
material science background, he was

269
00:15:36.110 --> 00:15:42.980
able to put these nanoparticles
through the various, you know,

270
00:15:43.130 --> 00:15:48.020
processes to actually make them
small enough. So they wouldn't

271
00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:51.620
agglomerate or come back together.
And so it was his

272
00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:56.150
expertise and his know how,
as a chemist in wherever

273
00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:59.480
the machines and the processes
that he was using to

274
00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.480
actually create these particles at
as fine a size as

275
00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:06.790
we were looking for. So
let me shift the conversation

276
00:16:06.790 --> 00:16:09.610
because we, you and I
met when we were volunteering

277
00:16:09.610 --> 00:16:14.290
to teach young people, science,
technology, and math. And I'm

278
00:16:14.290 --> 00:16:17.200
looking here in your PhD
and I'm looking at some

279
00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:21.040
of your, your energy equations
and I'm teaching my, my

280
00:16:21.060 --> 00:16:23.650
11 year old algebra now,
and he's getting into quadratic

281
00:16:23.650 --> 00:16:26.440
equations and stuff like that.
And I'm trying to understand

282
00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:28.960
how do we take an
11 year old or a

283
00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:31.870
13 year old or 15
year old, and in just

284
00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.860
10 years, turn them into
a PhD candidate. How does

285
00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:39.700
that happen? How do we
make more Corey Frasiers and

286
00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:43.270
how do we, how do
we scale that? I mean,

287
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.390
were you doing advanced math
when you were 10 and

288
00:16:46.390 --> 00:16:49.780
you had a jumpstart or
did you, was it sponsorship

289
00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:53.410
and mentorship? What took you
that far? That's a, that's

290
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:56.260
a great question. And, you
know, I think you touched

291
00:16:56.260 --> 00:16:58.570
on something I think is
really important for me to

292
00:16:58.570 --> 00:17:03.850
say that hopefully will, will
demystify maybe the whole being

293
00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:06.550
a PhD thing. And that's
that I actually don't like

294
00:17:06.580 --> 00:17:12.940
math that much, this interview
is over. It's done, I'm

295
00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.530
hitting style. I'm a heritage,
you know, but you know,

296
00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:20.290
honestly, you know, beyond algebra,
I'm not really a fan

297
00:17:20.290 --> 00:17:23.050
of math, but yet you
have to take one at

298
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:26.560
each new graduate degree level.
You have to make it

299
00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:29.140
through that class. And I
will be honest, I made

300
00:17:29.140 --> 00:17:31.150
it through those classes by
the skin of my teeth.

301
00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:34.660
But the thing is, I
think that shows that, you

302
00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:38.320
know, being a PhD is
there, there is no cut

303
00:17:38.590 --> 00:17:43.420
formula. There is no template.
So expectation that every PhD

304
00:17:43.630 --> 00:17:47.410
has all of these skill
sets that you would expect.

305
00:17:47.410 --> 00:17:50.280
So not every PhD is
great at math or, or,

306
00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:54.570
or joys at not every
PhD enjoys, I don't know,

307
00:17:55.350 --> 00:18:01.110
chemical equations and balancing those
equations. Right. But the PhD

308
00:18:01.110 --> 00:18:06.600
as, as, as a, the
nomenclature of it, and the,

309
00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:08.940
the idea behind it is
that you understand enough of

310
00:18:08.940 --> 00:18:15.150
the principles that you can
go in, better understand something

311
00:18:15.150 --> 00:18:18.900
through investigation, through research, through
deeper diving. So you can

312
00:18:18.900 --> 00:18:24.480
teach yourself or come up
with those scientific understandings by

313
00:18:24.510 --> 00:18:28.200
virtue of employing whatever the
methods and principles are that

314
00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:31.050
you learn. And so to
the point that you were

315
00:18:31.050 --> 00:18:37.290
making about, you know, getting
your son started on, on,

316
00:18:37.290 --> 00:18:41.610
on math and, and, and
certainly I know far more

317
00:18:41.610 --> 00:18:45.600
advanced level of math than
anybody else, but the idea

318
00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:48.870
is to get kids interested,
you've got to get them

319
00:18:48.870 --> 00:18:53.010
started early. That doesn't mean
that later isn't, isn't, isn't

320
00:18:53.030 --> 00:18:57.840
a good thing to do.
But the earlier you get

321
00:18:57.870 --> 00:19:04.170
a child to see themselves
doing math, doing science and

322
00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:08.520
interacting with people who they
know, you know, can do

323
00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:11.100
this or who, or look
like them, or who sound

324
00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:15.360
like them, or who have
the same interests. The more

325
00:19:15.360 --> 00:19:19.410
likely they are to pursue
these careers. And the more

326
00:19:19.410 --> 00:19:22.530
likely that they're going to
be resilient against obstacles in

327
00:19:22.530 --> 00:19:26.790
these careers. Cause some of
the biggest challenges are for

328
00:19:26.790 --> 00:19:29.280
kids is isn't that, that
they don't like math and

329
00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.470
science. And so they don't
go into it is that

330
00:19:31.830 --> 00:19:34.800
they start to see things
as a challenge from the

331
00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:39.330
standpoint of, okay, these problems
were hard in this class

332
00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:41.610
in science or in math.
I don't want to put

333
00:19:41.610 --> 00:19:44.700
that. Or I feel embarrassed
that these other kids over

334
00:19:44.700 --> 00:19:48.090
here were able to understand
this problem. And I wasn't.

335
00:19:48.180 --> 00:19:51.180
So I need to now
retreat from that. Or, you

336
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:56.700
know, maybe it doesn't seem
as cool anymore. Maybe there's,

337
00:19:56.940 --> 00:19:59.820
there's a societal pressure for
them to back away from

338
00:19:59.820 --> 00:20:02.940
being smart. I think that's
a little bit less apparent

339
00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:05.190
nowadays because nerds kind of
rule the world a little

340
00:20:05.190 --> 00:20:08.160
bit more than they used
to when you are learners

341
00:20:08.160 --> 00:20:11.850
will inherit the earth right
here. Right. You know, but

342
00:20:11.850 --> 00:20:17.820
I think the more you
tie in their ability to

343
00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:21.510
do these things and seeing
other people who, who maybe

344
00:20:21.510 --> 00:20:23.790
they identify with, or maybe
they, you know, that Meyer

345
00:20:23.790 --> 00:20:26.190
who were able to go
down this path it's even

346
00:20:26.190 --> 00:20:29.030
better. Yeah. And to your,
to your credit, one of

347
00:20:29.030 --> 00:20:31.640
the things that is a
characteristic that is that you're

348
00:20:31.640 --> 00:20:34.160
known for, and I'm gonna
use one of your LinkedIn

349
00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:40.610
recommendations, as an example, is
conscientiousness, meticulousness and thoughtfulness. You

350
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:43.370
don't necessarily have to be
an expert at everything, right?

351
00:20:43.490 --> 00:20:47.680
If you have attention to
detail, right, my son or

352
00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:51.070
my theoretical daughter doesn't have
to love math, but they

353
00:20:51.070 --> 00:20:52.900
have to respect it and
know that it's a tool

354
00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:55.930
and double check their work
is what the current thing,

355
00:20:55.930 --> 00:20:58.320
the 11 year old is
working on right now. You

356
00:20:58.320 --> 00:20:59.700
don't have to love it.
But if you double check

357
00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.580
it, it's a tool. It's
a very powerful tool in

358
00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:08.010
to be honest, that I'm
meticulousness in that approach, I

359
00:21:08.010 --> 00:21:10.230
think will not only benefit
you. Some of it benefits

360
00:21:10.230 --> 00:21:12.270
anybody. And I say this
all the time about, you

361
00:21:12.270 --> 00:21:15.510
know, STEM or steam is
that even if you don't

362
00:21:15.510 --> 00:21:19.440
go into a traditional science
or technology or mathematics based

363
00:21:19.440 --> 00:21:22.200
field and you pursue something
that's more on the art

364
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:26.400
side, having technical knowledge will
help you and your art,

365
00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.280
having an understanding of, you
know, being detailed, oriented, double-checking

366
00:21:32.340 --> 00:21:36.030
understanding, seeing things through a
method, through an algorithm, you

367
00:21:36.030 --> 00:21:39.450
know, in your head will
make it far easier for

368
00:21:39.450 --> 00:21:42.630
you to take those things
and execute those steps in

369
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:46.110
your art. And honestly, it
helps me a lot, not

370
00:21:46.110 --> 00:21:49.050
even just with engineering or
something, technical or something, or

371
00:21:49.140 --> 00:21:53.310
super technical, but spreadsheets while
I'm working on spreadsheets and

372
00:21:53.310 --> 00:21:56.100
I'm doing something that's a
high pressure situation for some

373
00:21:56.100 --> 00:22:00.090
executive or trying to crunch
out some, some document or

374
00:22:00.090 --> 00:22:03.750
something of some kind often
my ability to double check

375
00:22:03.750 --> 00:22:05.880
something or see the algorithm
for how it needs to

376
00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:09.300
be executed, saves me time
or makes me look really

377
00:22:09.300 --> 00:22:13.110
good in front of that,
that, that executive person, because

378
00:22:13.170 --> 00:22:16.080
I'm able to execute to
some kind of method. You

379
00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:19.560
know, The, the thing that
I want them to understand

380
00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.840
also is that there's so
much power in this. Like

381
00:22:21.840 --> 00:22:24.480
you were talking about blowing
things up, but what you're

382
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:28.470
actually talking about is theorizing
that things will work a

383
00:22:28.470 --> 00:22:31.860
certain kind of way, then
testing it and proving that

384
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.050
you do in fact, have
an understanding like these models,

385
00:22:34.050 --> 00:22:36.570
these equations to, for lack
of a better word, they've

386
00:22:36.570 --> 00:22:39.060
been proven to be factual
because we observed that they

387
00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:41.550
are in fact what they
say, they are like, you

388
00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:44.190
are predicting the future with
math and then proving it

389
00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:48.060
by doing actual experiments. Exactly.
Be honest. That's the thing

390
00:22:48.060 --> 00:22:53.160
that interested me, excuse me,
the most about working with

391
00:22:53.970 --> 00:22:56.760
most the simulations and, and,
and why I was so

392
00:22:56.760 --> 00:22:59.940
keen to do this project
work. When my advisor approached

393
00:22:59.940 --> 00:23:02.130
me about us, because at
the end of the day,

394
00:23:02.130 --> 00:23:06.210
prediction is about helping people
see around corners. And when

395
00:23:06.210 --> 00:23:08.580
I start to reframe everything,
cause I was helping my

396
00:23:08.580 --> 00:23:12.390
lab mates see around the
corners of what tests, what

397
00:23:12.420 --> 00:23:16.110
chemical compositions should we execute
or should we go and

398
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.320
develop and then, you know,
test our theories on. So

399
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.920
that way we save time,
we save energy. We, we

400
00:23:21.920 --> 00:23:26.130
save resources and I take
that same application to engineers

401
00:23:26.130 --> 00:23:29.880
at Intel, where we do
thermal and structural analysis for,

402
00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:32.970
you know, super computing hardware.
And I tell them that,

403
00:23:32.970 --> 00:23:35.550
Hey, the reason we're doing
this prediction is not for

404
00:23:35.550 --> 00:23:38.490
the sake of data and
just feeling gee whiz about,

405
00:23:38.490 --> 00:23:42.270
you know, getting temperature and
all these numbers coming up

406
00:23:42.270 --> 00:23:44.400
all over the place. It's
so we can help people

407
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:48.620
make decisions effectively earlier to
save costs and bring about

408
00:23:48.620 --> 00:23:51.910
a better experience. Yeah. And
I suppose, I suppose if

409
00:23:51.910 --> 00:23:54.160
you, if you got the
model wrong, you could waste

410
00:23:54.250 --> 00:23:57.070
a year of building a
whole real thing and say,

411
00:23:57.100 --> 00:23:59.230
Oh, we were, we were
off by an order of

412
00:23:59.230 --> 00:24:01.990
magnitude. We missed a zero
there. You know, you gotta

413
00:24:01.990 --> 00:24:05.010
tear it all down, start
over. Yeah. That, that isn't

414
00:24:05.010 --> 00:24:09.280
entirely possible. Hopefully when you
have a model, you can

415
00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:13.360
put it through enough tests
or put it through, through

416
00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.780
the paces just enough so
that you can catch, you

417
00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.020
know, a mathematical error or,
you know, some other semantic

418
00:24:20.020 --> 00:24:26.350
issue, you know, that won't
affect in product. Right? Yeah.

419
00:24:27.370 --> 00:24:30.250
So you were working while
you were getting your doctorate.

420
00:24:30.310 --> 00:24:34.000
So you were basically commuting.
Were you working at night

421
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.900
and doing your doctorate in
the day? How many hours

422
00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:39.580
did you, did you have
extra hours? We didn't know

423
00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:44.110
about The answer is yes
to both, but yeah, I

424
00:24:44.110 --> 00:24:46.390
was, I was actually working
full time in the space

425
00:24:46.390 --> 00:24:50.290
program and then driving two
hours, one way from Southeast

426
00:24:50.290 --> 00:24:52.990
Houston and all the way
up to call the station

427
00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:55.690
to go to Texas a
and M and do, making

428
00:24:55.690 --> 00:24:58.030
that commute anywhere from one
to three times a week

429
00:24:58.030 --> 00:25:01.780
for about three years. And
yeah, it was a very

430
00:25:01.780 --> 00:25:05.260
interesting experience. But what I
did was I, you know,

431
00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:08.230
basically you hit it on
the, on, on, on the

432
00:25:08.230 --> 00:25:10.840
head. I was, sometimes I
was working during the day

433
00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:12.580
and then I would go
to school in the day

434
00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:15.790
and it's always at night.
And then sometimes I would

435
00:25:15.790 --> 00:25:19.330
wind up working at night
or on the weekends. Fortunately

436
00:25:19.330 --> 00:25:22.000
my, my job was very
charitable and they were willing

437
00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:24.180
to support me and the
team I had it at,

438
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:27.070
my job was willing to
support me and I would

439
00:25:27.070 --> 00:25:28.420
pick up the Slack for
them when it came to

440
00:25:28.420 --> 00:25:30.430
work and things like that.
So I was working both

441
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.880
day and night. Oh my
goodness. I was, I was

442
00:25:33.880 --> 00:25:35.890
working nine to five and
going to school six to

443
00:25:35.890 --> 00:25:38.620
10, although it took me,
it took me 11 years

444
00:25:38.620 --> 00:25:42.160
to finish my undergraduate so
I can, I can relate.

445
00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:43.810
I can't relate to the
two hour commute. My, my

446
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:46.930
commute was only 45 minutes,
but what are you doing?

447
00:25:46.930 --> 00:25:48.580
And that you listen into
books on tape. What are

448
00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:50.410
you doing? Cause that's wasted
time if you're not filling

449
00:25:50.410 --> 00:25:53.980
your brain up. Exactly. I
would say that that those

450
00:25:53.980 --> 00:25:55.690
three years are the years
where I really fell in

451
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:59.740
love with audio books. You
know, that's all I did

452
00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.610
was listen to audio books
and, and NPR for two

453
00:26:03.610 --> 00:26:07.810
hours. Yeah. I drive up
to Microsoft from Portland. It's

454
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.170
four hours up and about
seven hours down in audio

455
00:26:11.170 --> 00:26:14.140
books, audio books and NPR,
and the occasional conference call

456
00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:17.290
is definitely the way to
do it. So now I

457
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:19.990
met you at eye urban
teen while we were both

458
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.520
giving talks on getting kids
excited about, about STEM, other

459
00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:27.010
than telling your story, how
do you, how do you

460
00:26:27.010 --> 00:26:29.110
shake these children and say,
look, look at what you

461
00:26:29.110 --> 00:26:31.690
can do. If you just
stick your mind to it.

462
00:26:31.690 --> 00:26:34.150
If you just keep, you
know, keep the faith and

463
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.700
do that commute, how do
you get kids to see

464
00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:39.160
that this is possible? Yeah.
You know, one of the

465
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:41.860
things I'm always telling kids,
it's like, man, you guys

466
00:26:41.860 --> 00:26:45.240
live in, but obviously there
are challenges of society, but

467
00:26:45.630 --> 00:26:49.260
you live in like the
most amazing time ever. Like

468
00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.410
anything you want to do
is at your fingertips and

469
00:26:52.410 --> 00:26:54.720
living in the future. Yeah.
You know, you guys almost

470
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:57.180
don't have to have imagination
anymore because you can just

471
00:26:57.180 --> 00:26:59.580
make it seem like it's
actually there, whatever it is,

472
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:03.630
you know, whether it's really
good CT CDI or it's

473
00:27:03.990 --> 00:27:07.830
a augmented reality or virtual
or something else, you know,

474
00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:09.750
you, you, you could pretty
much say I want to

475
00:27:09.750 --> 00:27:11.730
do this or I want
to see it and it

476
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:15.150
can happen. And I think
one of the things that's

477
00:27:15.150 --> 00:27:18.570
really exciting for it for
a kid is, is just

478
00:27:18.570 --> 00:27:21.120
using the fact that there's
so much accessibility. So if

479
00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.600
kids have ideas for like
apps or businesses or whatever

480
00:27:24.600 --> 00:27:26.820
the case may be, get
them started on it, you

481
00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:28.710
know, go ahead and, and
say, Hey, here you go.

482
00:27:28.890 --> 00:27:30.270
And a lot of this
stuff, you know, a lot

483
00:27:30.270 --> 00:27:31.950
or a lot of opportunities
to do these things are

484
00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:35.400
pretty low bar. They're almost
a free necessarily, but the

485
00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.250
bar is pretty low to
be able to access a

486
00:27:38.250 --> 00:27:40.850
lot of these things. It
just, the existence of Khan

487
00:27:40.850 --> 00:27:43.910
Academy has been extraordinary for
my kids. Yeah, Yeah, exactly.

488
00:27:43.910 --> 00:27:46.220
You know, how did we
learn math Before? I guess

489
00:27:46.220 --> 00:27:49.010
we had paper and we
had a Tia, Tia 89

490
00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:51.920
calculator was basically all we
had. Yeah. Yeah. You know,

491
00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.110
and it's like, man, I
wish I had so many

492
00:27:54.110 --> 00:27:56.720
more of these things as
a kid because I would

493
00:27:56.720 --> 00:28:00.980
have certainly been able to
apply what the teacher was

494
00:28:00.980 --> 00:28:04.520
telling me, you know, much
more readily and then build

495
00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:08.000
a fire. My passions get
jump-started a lot quicker rather

496
00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.010
than existing in my own
head until I got the

497
00:28:10.010 --> 00:28:12.170
college for the most part,
you know, as far as

498
00:28:12.170 --> 00:28:14.480
what I'm willing to do.
And so I think for

499
00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:20.420
the most part that kids
need to be able to

500
00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:26.120
put their hands, you know,
literally figuratively on the thing

501
00:28:26.210 --> 00:28:28.790
that we're talking about when
it comes to STEM. So

502
00:28:28.790 --> 00:28:31.190
I, our routine, you know,
we're, we're doing at the

503
00:28:31.200 --> 00:28:34.820
summits, we're, we're doing, you
know, these, these different tests

504
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:36.980
are like in the healthcare
arena. You know, if we're

505
00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.940
talking about preventative healthcare, we're
talking about how we're using

506
00:28:41.270 --> 00:28:44.570
data analysis or AI or
something to, to help us

507
00:28:44.570 --> 00:28:47.870
do better healthcare. We have
actual healthcare professionals running a

508
00:28:47.870 --> 00:28:51.560
workshop. That's showing them how
this is being used. Right.

509
00:28:52.370 --> 00:28:54.040
And I think kids need
to actually see that. And

510
00:28:54.050 --> 00:28:57.320
if it's something regarding technology
nearby, like sneakers and sneaker

511
00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.420
head, I'm trying to become
one I'm trying. But if

512
00:29:02.420 --> 00:29:05.390
they see how, you know,
what, what does Nike do?

513
00:29:05.390 --> 00:29:08.660
I believe Matthew nurse was
up there talking about what

514
00:29:08.660 --> 00:29:11.510
Nike's doing with technology when
he gave his talk. But

515
00:29:11.510 --> 00:29:14.870
if they could see how
technology is playing a role

516
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:18.470
in the very things that
they like, you know, then

517
00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:21.170
that's what gives them that
sense of, okay. Yeah, this

518
00:29:21.170 --> 00:29:23.390
is great. This is something
I should pursue because there's

519
00:29:23.390 --> 00:29:25.790
other things to do when
it comes to Nike, other

520
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:27.710
than being an athlete, there's
plenty of things on the

521
00:29:27.710 --> 00:29:30.650
technology side. There's, there's other
things I can do in

522
00:29:30.650 --> 00:29:34.910
sports. In fact, sports is
very much dominated by data

523
00:29:34.910 --> 00:29:39.110
and technology right now, whether
it's statisticians or it's, or

524
00:29:39.110 --> 00:29:47.710
it's actual, you Know, performance
data, right? So it's give

525
00:29:47.710 --> 00:29:51.460
them, I'm hearing, I'm hearing
applied apply to apply. Like

526
00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:53.650
it's big theoretical science is
not going to light at

527
00:29:53.650 --> 00:29:56.920
night for 11 year olds.
But if you tell them

528
00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.770
like Matthew nurse, the example
you gave you the director

529
00:29:59.770 --> 00:30:02.410
of the Nike sport research
lab, this is somebody who's

530
00:30:02.410 --> 00:30:06.190
taking math and science and
applying it to making shoes,

531
00:30:06.550 --> 00:30:10.000
to, to making, and then
ultimately making it successful. So

532
00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.850
you gotta draw a straight
line between that, that, that

533
00:30:12.850 --> 00:30:15.340
equation that my 11 years
working on, and then someone's

534
00:30:15.340 --> 00:30:20.770
success. Exactly. Application. We live
in a world where, you

535
00:30:20.770 --> 00:30:24.010
know, at this point, you
know, everybody has this immediate

536
00:30:24.010 --> 00:30:28.420
gratification sense. So if you're
getting someone that immediate contact

537
00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:31.960
and immediate touch point, it's
sticking a lot more random.

538
00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:35.590
Fantastic. Well, I really appreciate
you chatting with me today,

539
00:30:35.590 --> 00:30:38.560
dr. Corey Frazier, and I
appreciate you going out there

540
00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:41.920
and fostering a culture of
innovation at Intel and, and

541
00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.960
the work you did in
the space shuttle. Oh, thank

542
00:30:43.960 --> 00:30:45.850
you very much, Scott. I
really appreciate you having me

543
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.310
on, and this is, this
has been fun. I really

544
00:30:48.310 --> 00:30:50.950
enjoyed it. Alright. Thank you,
sir. I hopefully see you

545
00:30:50.950 --> 00:30:54.490
again. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

546
00:30:54.490 --> 00:31:15.780
see <inaudible>.
