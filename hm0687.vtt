<inaudible>. Hi, this is Scott

9
00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.940
Hanselman is cancel minutes talking
with Saranya. Berneke about food

10
00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:49.190
land. How are you? I'm
doing well. How are you?

11
00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:52.910
I lovely. So we have
to be with, to be

12
00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:56.300
honest and ethical here. Okay.
We are friends and I

13
00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:58.940
am speaking at code land.
Yes, you are. I am

14
00:00:58.940 --> 00:01:02.090
speaking at code land because
it is a joy and

15
00:01:02.090 --> 00:01:03.860
I don't mean to lie.
I go to a lot

16
00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:07.130
of conferences. I think it
is probably the only conference

17
00:01:07.130 --> 00:01:09.350
that I have like cried
at in a good way.

18
00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:13.940
Positive, sweet, amazing way. That's
my goal is just to

19
00:01:13.940 --> 00:01:16.190
make you cry. Is that
the goal, the whole clause.

20
00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:19.430
That's the whole point Planning
and then Hanselman cries at

21
00:01:19.430 --> 00:01:22.040
the end. That's how you
end the last colon. I

22
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.540
went to, I think it
was two years ago. I

23
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:26.390
missed last year. I was
scheduling. Didn't work out, I

24
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:31.610
think with build. And after
the conference I walk out

25
00:01:31.610 --> 00:01:36.140
the door into the hallway
and the conference organizers were

26
00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:42.530
all in a line, applauding
the attendees and then like

27
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:48.020
the water was, You know,
that wasn't planned by the

28
00:01:48.020 --> 00:01:52.580
way. You're kidding. That was
completely spontaneous. Yeah, the volunteers

29
00:01:52.580 --> 00:01:54.530
is it done on their,
on their own. That's amazing.

30
00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:56.090
Is that a thing now?
Is that a thing? Now

31
00:01:56.090 --> 00:01:57.410
it's a thing. Now we
have to do it. We

32
00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:00.110
have to applaud people as
they exit. Yeah. Why are

33
00:02:00.110 --> 00:02:01.850
you applauding people? What is
the point of code land?

34
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:06.350
The point of Colana says
celebrate the wonderful world of

35
00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:08.000
code. I feel like so
often when we go to

36
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:12.380
technical conferences, they are all
about the tools, the rock

37
00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:14.540
stars, the, you know, the
reason why we're all there

38
00:02:14.540 --> 00:02:17.270
is to celebrate the tools.
And I think especially for

39
00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:20.780
our community, we are interested
in the tools and the

40
00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:23.570
context of the solutions. They,
you know, the problems that

41
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:25.910
they solve, the solutions they
come with. And so we

42
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:30.200
want to know, how does
code affect health? How does

43
00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:33.260
code affect art? How does
it affect the way that

44
00:02:33.260 --> 00:02:36.080
we move transportation? How does
it affect the real world?

45
00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:39.170
And so for us, coding
is really the tool. It's

46
00:02:39.170 --> 00:02:41.000
the means to an end.
And we want to give

47
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.520
a space to celebrate the
wonderful things you can do

48
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.150
with code. So that's what
COVID is all about. Do

49
00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:52.130
you think it's a squishy
conference? Like there are, there

50
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:54.260
are people out there, there
are, let's call them naysayers,

51
00:02:54.260 --> 00:02:56.240
but let's just maybe say
that there are the, there

52
00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:59.710
are like the technical conferences
where people with PhDs about

53
00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:04.810
PhD things and there are
feelings conferences, but this doesn't

54
00:03:04.810 --> 00:03:07.000
feel, I mean, we're, we're,
I'm in my feelings at

55
00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.460
code land, but there's a
lot of hard technical stuff

56
00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.270
here. Is it a squishy
conference? Not really. We do

57
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:14.010
have at least one or
two talks that are a

58
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:16.950
little bit more nontechnical. So
for example, this year we're

59
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:19.500
going to have one called
med to dev me like

60
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:22.410
medical school to dev my
journey through depression, which is

61
00:03:22.410 --> 00:03:26.550
very much like a very
emotional, they're a very deep

62
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.680
talk. We're going to have
trigger warnings for that talk.

63
00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:31.230
It goes into some pretty
dark places, but that is

64
00:03:31.230 --> 00:03:33.000
probably one of the few
I want to say. Maybe

65
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.560
even the only non technical
talk, everything else is very

66
00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.320
much rooted in the technology
and in the, the code

67
00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:43.680
itself. But again, it's the
code in the, you know,

68
00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:45.510
in the pursuit of some
other purpose. So we have

69
00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:49.110
one, for example, that's called
art meets algorithms, talking about

70
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.970
all the beautiful art and
you can create and all

71
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.720
the art you can recreate
using algorithms. We have another

72
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:57.690
one that I love called
laughter is the most serious

73
00:03:57.690 --> 00:04:01.650
weapon, which is all about
this, this, this joke app,

74
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.290
where it says, you know,
how there's the, the, the

75
00:04:04.290 --> 00:04:07.050
difference in pay between, you
know, people of color and

76
00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:09.330
white people and men and
women. And there's all these

77
00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.140
pay disparities, right? This app
allows you to go out

78
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:16.530
to dinner and split the
bill based on those disparities.

79
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:20.490
And it is a really
deep, funny way of talking

80
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:23.670
about something very, very real.
But again, it's rooted in

81
00:04:23.670 --> 00:04:26.790
technology. There's an actual app
that does this. So we

82
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:30.090
try to combine the nontechnical
stuff, but also rooted in

83
00:04:30.090 --> 00:04:33.300
technology as much as possible.
Hmm. How do you find

84
00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:36.300
people? Are you curating? Are
you or people putting in

85
00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:39.510
CFPs? Are you calling them
or a little, both? It's

86
00:04:39.510 --> 00:04:41.160
a little bit of both.
So this year it's about

87
00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:43.830
half and half, half of
the folks are invited speakers.

88
00:04:44.190 --> 00:04:46.140
I find them, some of
them are friends. Some of

89
00:04:46.140 --> 00:04:49.440
them are people just from
my network. A good number

90
00:04:49.440 --> 00:04:52.110
are folks that I've seen
or met at other events,

91
00:04:52.140 --> 00:04:54.870
other conferences, or the last
one I mentioned, laughter is

92
00:04:54.870 --> 00:04:57.360
the most serious weapon. I
saw her give this talk.

93
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.400
I think it was three
years ago, maybe four years

94
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:01.710
ago. And I, that talked
to stuck with me. And

95
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:03.570
I said to myself, if
I ever do a conference,

96
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.730
she has to speak at
it. And so I found

97
00:05:05.730 --> 00:05:07.740
her a hundred down and
now she's going to be

98
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:09.690
able to give that talk
at, at con at the

99
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:12.150
conference, but we do have
a, the CFP as well.

100
00:05:12.150 --> 00:05:15.000
So the other half are
folks who I've frankly never

101
00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.770
heard of before, but have
some really great things to

102
00:05:16.770 --> 00:05:20.450
say. One of the things
also that is, that is,

103
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:24.030
is you're becoming known for,
and I've, I've heard this

104
00:05:24.030 --> 00:05:25.770
because I've experienced it, but
I've also heard it from

105
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:28.740
other speakers is the amount
of prep. A lot of

106
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.640
times I think conferences, they
see a good talk. They

107
00:05:32.670 --> 00:05:34.230
call the person and say,
Hey, come to my kind

108
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:37.140
of my conference. They send
them a coach airfare ticket

109
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.060
and set them up at
the holiday Inn. And they

110
00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:41.190
don't really talk to that
person again for six months,

111
00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.310
that person shows up, does
the talk, the talk is

112
00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:46.860
good or bad or adequate.
And then the person leaves

113
00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.820
you spend a, a no
disrespect, an inordinate amount of

114
00:05:50.820 --> 00:05:55.170
time with the speakers. What
are you doing with the

115
00:05:55.170 --> 00:05:58.910
speakers? So we have three,
generally three Meetings. So the

116
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.760
first one is the talk
outline that is to review

117
00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:04.130
the overall structure of the
talk. Make sure it has

118
00:06:04.130 --> 00:06:06.680
some good meat on its
bones, make sure that it's,

119
00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:09.560
you know, well thought out
or the pieces fall together.

120
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.170
There's a nice cohesive story
and nice narrative throughout the

121
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:15.140
whole thing. That's the first
meeting. The second meeting is

122
00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:17.930
really focusing on the slides.
So how does that talk,

123
00:06:17.930 --> 00:06:21.320
outline, translate to the slides?
Are there, you know, images

124
00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:22.910
or is there a tax
that they're too much? Usually

125
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:25.070
there's too much text. That's
usually the problem to the

126
00:06:25.070 --> 00:06:27.650
slides, you know, work really
well together. What does the

127
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:30.230
design look like? And then
the last meeting is the

128
00:06:30.230 --> 00:06:33.740
rehearsal. So putting all that
together, they'll do a run

129
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:36.440
through of the talk from
top to bottom, and then

130
00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:39.020
I'll give them notes and
feedback on that. So usually

131
00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:41.000
it takes about, I don't
know, maybe a couple hours

132
00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.300
per speaker to do all
those meetings, but it's totally

133
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:46.250
worth it. You know, it's
interesting. When I first decided

134
00:06:46.250 --> 00:06:48.830
that I wanted to do
speaker coaching, I was really

135
00:06:48.830 --> 00:06:51.590
worried that people would think
of it as homework as

136
00:06:51.590 --> 00:06:53.180
an assignment they had to
do. And that they'd be

137
00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:55.010
kind of annoyed that they
had to do this thing,

138
00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:57.500
but they've actually seen it
as a benefit, as a

139
00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.170
perk, as a way for
them to really focus on

140
00:07:00.170 --> 00:07:01.910
their talk, to get feedback.
That's the thing, a lot

141
00:07:01.910 --> 00:07:04.400
of speakers, we never get
a chance to know how

142
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:06.920
to improve. We never get
that honest feedback from folks

143
00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:08.870
to see how we're doing.
And this has ended up

144
00:07:08.870 --> 00:07:10.610
being a really cool way
for them to do that.

145
00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:14.200
Have you had any fancy
speakers? You know, the Scott

146
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.090
Hanson's of the world that
just like, well, I don't

147
00:07:16.090 --> 00:07:19.300
want your feedback. I'm a
professional speaker. I speak all

148
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.520
the time. I'm like, don't
why don't give me feedback.

149
00:07:22.060 --> 00:07:25.030
No, I haven't. People have
been very accommodating. So to

150
00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:26.690
give you an example, Jen
Simmons is a, is a

151
00:07:26.710 --> 00:07:28.420
very big deal. She does
a lot of stuff with

152
00:07:28.420 --> 00:07:30.610
CSS and I was worried
that she gotta look at

153
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:32.950
me like I've, you know,
I've won awards for speaking.

154
00:07:32.950 --> 00:07:34.930
Like who do you think
you are? But she and

155
00:07:34.930 --> 00:07:38.350
I had a great, great
adventure kind of crafting her

156
00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.990
talk and me giving her
feedback. And I think what

157
00:07:41.050 --> 00:07:44.230
prevents the, you know, the,
the Deaconess from coming out

158
00:07:44.230 --> 00:07:46.420
for different speakers is the
fact that at the end

159
00:07:46.420 --> 00:07:48.160
of the day, I know
my audience and they don't.

160
00:07:48.550 --> 00:07:50.650
Right. So even if you
have a really great talk,

161
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:52.390
even if you have something
that you're sure is going

162
00:07:52.390 --> 00:07:54.880
to work, you don't necessarily
know that it's going to

163
00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.240
work for our audience. So
either way, it's valuable to

164
00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:00.220
have my input just to
say, Hey, you know, this

165
00:08:00.220 --> 00:08:02.260
is a newbie audience. Here
are the things that we

166
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:05.020
care about here are the
things that might be confusing.

167
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.640
And just to make sure
that it fits with our

168
00:08:06.640 --> 00:08:09.430
community. That was a really
good reminder. Like I was

169
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:12.790
thinking, my first reaction was
like, like, I would be

170
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:15.340
uncomfortable giving that feedback. Cause
like, who am I like

171
00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:18.190
other than the conference organizer,
which is a big deal.

172
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.140
Like, but it did the
fact that it is your

173
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:22.510
audience. And I think that's
really important. I always recommend

174
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:27.790
when I'm teaching, how to
present that people localize their

175
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.670
talks and people have said,
well, you know, you mean

176
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:33.490
like in foreign languages? I'm
like, well, no, like literally

177
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:36.430
localized down to the audience
like down, it's not just

178
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:38.920
shouting out like good morning,
Philadelphia at the beginning of

179
00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:42.310
the call, like really localizing
it. Absolutely. And that's one

180
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:44.560
thing that I always ask
when I'm the one speaking

181
00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:46.600
is I say, who is
your audience? What are they

182
00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:49.600
like, how technical are they?
What is their background? And

183
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:51.550
that really helps me modify,
even if I'm giving the

184
00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.220
same talk a few times,
it helps me modify what

185
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:56.160
I'm saying to really make
I'm catering to the right

186
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:59.960
audience. Yeah. I did a
talk a while back many,

187
00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:02.840
many years ago. And there
was a poster in the,

188
00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:04.670
like a movie poster and
I can't remember what it

189
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.310
was, but it was something
like, you know, stepbrothers or

190
00:09:07.310 --> 00:09:09.830
something with will or, and,
you know, will Ferrell and

191
00:09:09.830 --> 00:09:12.470
another guy or something like
that. And it landed well

192
00:09:12.470 --> 00:09:15.650
in Chicago. So I, I
think I was went elsewhere

193
00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.630
or maybe I was in
another country. Like, let's say,

194
00:09:17.630 --> 00:09:20.390
I'm in Poland, I'm just
making this up. And then

195
00:09:20.390 --> 00:09:23.360
I happened to run through
the talk ahead of time

196
00:09:23.360 --> 00:09:25.370
with the conference organizers. And
they were like, Oh, who's

197
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.470
that feral? You know? So
then I'm like, Oh, I'm

198
00:09:30.470 --> 00:09:32.990
going to have to cut
that whole bit. This was

199
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.600
actually 10 or 15 years
ago. And the person said,

200
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:37.640
well, no, tell me about
them. So I explained the

201
00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:40.610
whole plot of like stepbrothers
or whatever. And they're like,

202
00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.830
Oh, so these two funny
guys and they're brothers with,

203
00:09:42.830 --> 00:09:46.940
they're not brothers. And they
said, Oh yeah, like, you

204
00:09:46.940 --> 00:09:49.280
know, all off and Frank
or whatever. I just made

205
00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:51.770
that up. These two Polish
guys. And I was like,

206
00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:54.920
okay, hang on. It's too
funny guys. They're on TV.

207
00:09:54.920 --> 00:09:57.530
They're silly. They hang out
together. And then it turns

208
00:09:57.530 --> 00:10:01.430
out like those are archetypes
they're tropes. Right? So then

209
00:10:01.430 --> 00:10:06.320
they gave me the equivalent
people, the equivalent movie posters.

210
00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.970
I think they ended up
being talk show hosts or

211
00:10:07.970 --> 00:10:10.430
something like that. And then
I did the exact same

212
00:10:10.430 --> 00:10:14.450
joke except with those two
people. And that's now many,

213
00:10:14.450 --> 00:10:18.290
many years later become a
best practice for, for, you

214
00:10:18.290 --> 00:10:20.870
know, like I get into
the city. What's the, what's

215
00:10:20.870 --> 00:10:23.630
the feeling of the city.
What's the, what do people

216
00:10:23.630 --> 00:10:27.110
care about here? What's the
political environment. What's the third

217
00:10:27.110 --> 00:10:30.590
rail. What do I not
want to talk about? So

218
00:10:30.590 --> 00:10:35.780
code land is code newbies.
New developers are there senior

219
00:10:35.780 --> 00:10:38.150
people coming are welcome. We
do have a good chunk

220
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:40.370
of folks who are more
seniors. So we have folks

221
00:10:40.490 --> 00:10:42.440
last time we did the
survey, we had about a

222
00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:45.380
third, a third and another
third, where we had a

223
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.290
third of folks who were
kind of pre bootcamp, trying

224
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:51.050
to figure out what exactly
they wanted to learn, trying

225
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.420
to figure out what learning
to code even really meant

226
00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:56.240
and saw code land as
a great way to explore

227
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:59.630
and kind of double down
on their exploring journey. And

228
00:10:59.630 --> 00:11:02.270
then we had another third
of folks who were either

229
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:04.760
in the middle of bootcamp
or seriously invested in their

230
00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:08.210
education already. Maybe they're looking
for that first developer job.

231
00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:10.670
And then we had another
third of folks who were

232
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:12.320
a little bit more senior
had at least one or

233
00:11:12.320 --> 00:11:15.650
two years under their belt
or professional development experience, and

234
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:17.600
just really love the community
and love the idea of

235
00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:19.880
celebrating code. So we get
a good mix of folks.

236
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:24.380
What conferences are not serving
them though, like I've gone

237
00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.140
to conferences, but I've been
lucky that my company sends

238
00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:31.050
me and I've gone to
enough conferences where I actually,

239
00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:32.600
I was at a conference
a couple months ago and

240
00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.850
I didn't even know the
price of the conference. You

241
00:11:34.850 --> 00:11:37.370
know what a privilege that
is, right? So I look

242
00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:40.190
and I'm like, Holy crap,
this is a $2,000 conference.

243
00:11:40.250 --> 00:11:43.220
I would never pay $2,000
of my own money unless

244
00:11:43.220 --> 00:11:46.340
there was like, we were
going to the moon. Like

245
00:11:46.490 --> 00:11:48.470
I can't even imagine a
scenario where I would do

246
00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:53.000
that. When did conferences become
two K and how are

247
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:55.450
you catering to an audience
that can't afford to pay

248
00:11:55.450 --> 00:11:59.070
for a conference? That is
probably the biggest differentiator between

249
00:11:59.070 --> 00:12:01.740
us and technical other technical
conferences is that we are

250
00:12:01.980 --> 00:12:04.920
super affordable tickets. This year
start at nine, nine bucks.

251
00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.610
They go up to one
69. They include, you know,

252
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.770
three meals, you get breakfast,
lunch and dinner. We have

253
00:12:10.770 --> 00:12:12.270
an after party that we're
doing where we're going to

254
00:12:12.270 --> 00:12:14.820
serve a full dinner. So
it is one of the

255
00:12:14.820 --> 00:12:18.240
most affordable conferences that you'll
ever go to. That is

256
00:12:18.240 --> 00:12:21.270
also very, very high quality.
As we mentioned, I worked

257
00:12:21.330 --> 00:12:24.810
myself individually with every single
one of our speakers and

258
00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:27.630
we have, you know, tons
of review and the talks

259
00:12:27.630 --> 00:12:31.830
are just very, very thoroughly
picked and vetted. So that

260
00:12:31.830 --> 00:12:34.500
is the biggest thing is
making sure it's financially accessible.

261
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.330
The other thing that we
do to make it financial

262
00:12:36.330 --> 00:12:40.440
accessible is, is scholarships. So
one of the things that

263
00:12:40.680 --> 00:12:42.810
we've learned is that, you
know, the ticket price is

264
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.240
one thing, but even the
ticket price, even at nine,

265
00:12:45.240 --> 00:12:47.010
nine bucks is still too
high for a lot of

266
00:12:47.010 --> 00:12:49.830
folks. So we have an
opportunity to buy a $25

267
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:52.440
ticket if you qualify for
the sponsorship for the scholarship.

268
00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:55.620
And then we also have
the opportunity to get your

269
00:12:55.620 --> 00:12:58.740
travel funding. So for a
lot of folks, it's not

270
00:12:58.740 --> 00:13:02.280
actually the ticket price that
is cost prohibitive. It is

271
00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:05.220
the hotel, the flight, the
bus ticket, the train ticket.

272
00:13:05.490 --> 00:13:07.770
So we have a fund
that allows us to both

273
00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:12.180
give discounted tickets, but then
also provide travel. Hmm. So

274
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:15.210
that gets to the concept
of inclusion. Cause this is

275
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:18.300
the whole point of this
podcast. And the whole point

276
00:13:18.330 --> 00:13:22.200
of, of code land is
how do you build an,

277
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:26.730
you know, a conference that
includes everyone and it's so

278
00:13:26.730 --> 00:13:29.080
easy to forget. Well, my
company is paying for the

279
00:13:29.230 --> 00:13:32.460
hotel or, or a bus
ticket. I mean, 50 bucks

280
00:13:32.460 --> 00:13:36.060
who doesn't have 50 bucks.
Well, lots of people. Yeah.

281
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:38.850
That was the thing. When
I was reviewing the opportunity

282
00:13:38.850 --> 00:13:43.230
scholarship applications, it was heartbreaking,
frankly, reading a lot of

283
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:45.540
stories of folks who said,
you know, I have, I

284
00:13:45.540 --> 00:13:47.430
have, you know, barely anything
in my account. I have

285
00:13:47.430 --> 00:13:49.410
maybe a hundred dollars left
in my account this month.

286
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:51.990
I'm trying to make ends
meet I'm, you know, dealing

287
00:13:51.990 --> 00:13:54.540
with a, you know, very
serious or very serious health

288
00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:57.120
issue that, you know, prohibits
me from working as much

289
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:58.620
as I want to. I
mean, just hearing all the

290
00:13:58.620 --> 00:14:02.340
stories of folks who are
in tough situations, who still

291
00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:04.740
want to make the most
of their career, who still

292
00:14:04.740 --> 00:14:07.530
want to move forward in
this industry and still want

293
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.980
to make something, you know,
really wants to challenge themselves

294
00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:14.100
and do something with their,
with their work. It's really

295
00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:16.680
inspiring. And you know, it's
really incredible to read all

296
00:14:16.680 --> 00:14:20.340
the stories. Your code is
powerful. And so are you.

297
00:14:20.520 --> 00:14:22.680
And when you consider the
reach of your code, it's

298
00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.770
clear that to deliver quality
code, you must also deliver

299
00:14:25.770 --> 00:14:29.340
secure code. So where can
you start? A first step

300
00:14:29.340 --> 00:14:32.940
is educating yourself on basic
secure coding principles and beginning

301
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:36.750

308
00:15:07.610 --> 00:15:11.210
together an inclusive conference or
using these words inclusive, let's

309
00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.230
talk about the naysayers, right?
Someone might say, well, inclusion

310
00:15:15.230 --> 00:15:19.280
is, is coded language for,
you know, not old white

311
00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:22.220
folks or not old men
or not this or not

312
00:15:22.220 --> 00:15:25.520
that, but when I was
at code land, it really

313
00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.210
just felt like you just
meant everyone. When you said

314
00:15:29.210 --> 00:15:33.080
inclusion, you're just like, let's
think about who's being excluded

315
00:15:33.710 --> 00:15:36.020
and what can we do
to make their lives better?

316
00:15:36.310 --> 00:15:39.670
Yeah, absolutely. That's exactly it.
Like we, we love old

317
00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.820
white men. We love everyone.
We really are trying to

318
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.160
make sure that everyone feels
like they have a seat

319
00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:47.050
at the table that they
have a seat, you know,

320
00:15:47.050 --> 00:15:49.630
waiting for them. And I
think that when it comes

321
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:54.580
to inclusion, we are all
about making sure every part

322
00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:58.390
of our conference feels inclusive.
So that might mean, you

323
00:15:58.390 --> 00:16:00.820
know, making sure we have
a, you know, different food

324
00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:03.160
preferences cover, and making sure
that we ask about food

325
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:06.520
preferences this year. We're very
excited to announce that we

326
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:10.090
have a childcare. We have
onsite childcare, complimentary onsite childcare.

327
00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:13.840
That's available for parents. They
can bring their kids. We

328
00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.000
have, even if you look
at our speaker lineup, it's

329
00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.640
incredibly inclusive. We have people
from different parts of the

330
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.790
world that are coming to
speak different backgrounds. And so

331
00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:25.660
it is showcasing that idea
of inclusion throughout every single

332
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.900
part of the conference. It's
not just marketing to different

333
00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.710
groups. It's not just partnering
with specific organizations it's showing

334
00:16:32.740 --> 00:16:35.200
and, you know, almost proving
the people that you really

335
00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.690
mean what you say. And
that shows just by looking

336
00:16:37.690 --> 00:16:41.470
at the conference website, I
noticed also that, and, and

337
00:16:41.470 --> 00:16:43.420
the thing is great about
inclusion and code land is

338
00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:46.000
that it's on every access,
like it's age it's from

339
00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:48.520
other countries. I also noticed
you've got speakers like Jen

340
00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:52.540
Simmons that are spoke professionally
and like legendary speakers. And

341
00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.670
you've also got speakers that
maybe their first or second

342
00:16:54.670 --> 00:16:57.310
time speaking. Yeah, absolutely. How
do you take a risk

343
00:16:57.310 --> 00:17:00.070
on someone? How do you
pick someone who's maybe only

344
00:17:00.070 --> 00:17:01.780
given a talk or two
at a user group and

345
00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:04.360
then put them on stage?
Yeah. So I think there's

346
00:17:04.360 --> 00:17:08.200
two things. One, that's why
the speaker, the speaker coaching

347
00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:11.170
really is, is necessary. And
it's important because we want

348
00:17:11.170 --> 00:17:13.150
to make sure that the
folks who haven't had a

349
00:17:13.150 --> 00:17:16.240
lot of chance to practice
still feel prepared, that they're

350
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:19.750
still ready and still, you
know, and feel frankly for

351
00:17:19.750 --> 00:17:23.590
themselves, feel very comfortable on
that stage. So that speaker

352
00:17:23.590 --> 00:17:25.750
coaching opportunity is a way
to kind of bring folks

353
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:28.480
up and have them almost
like compete, you know, at

354
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.180
that level. But the second
part of it is that's

355
00:17:31.180 --> 00:17:34.900
why it's not entirely CFP.
So my logic, my reasoning

356
00:17:34.900 --> 00:17:37.930
for having half CFP, half
invited is that even if

357
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:40.270
the CFP folks are maybe
a little bit, you know,

358
00:17:40.270 --> 00:17:42.400
a little bit new and
maybe aren't as comfortable as

359
00:17:42.400 --> 00:17:45.100
they'd like to be, we
definitely have the invited speakers

360
00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:47.200
who I know are going
to crush it. And I

361
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.980
know are, I feel very
confident they can do a

362
00:17:49.980 --> 00:17:52.350
really great job on stage.
So we balance it out

363
00:17:52.350 --> 00:17:55.310
by having a mix of
CFP and invited speakers. Was

364
00:17:55.310 --> 00:17:57.380
it hard to nail this
down to what do you

365
00:17:57.380 --> 00:18:01.280
have? 12 talks plus workshops?
It was really, really hard,

366
00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:03.440
especially the workshops are really,
really tough. We had some

367
00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.920
really good ideas, some really
amazing folks who applied and

368
00:18:06.920 --> 00:18:09.140
it was tough. Cause we,
especially this year, we're doing

369
00:18:09.140 --> 00:18:11.240
a one day conference. And
so there just aren't that

370
00:18:11.240 --> 00:18:13.940
many slots there isn't that
much time. And even our

371
00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:16.460
talks are pretty quick. Like
our talks are only 15

372
00:18:16.460 --> 00:18:19.790
minutes, which is very short
for a conference. Usually conference

373
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:22.550
talks are at least 20
to 40 minutes. So even

374
00:18:22.550 --> 00:18:25.070
with that, you know, that
limited time it's, it was

375
00:18:25.070 --> 00:18:26.750
really tough to cut it
down to the folks that

376
00:18:26.750 --> 00:18:29.690
we have. Wow. That's challenging.
One of the things I

377
00:18:29.690 --> 00:18:32.450
noticed that I've never seen
at a conference before is

378
00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:37.130
you call out the exhibit
hall, like visit our sponsors,

379
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.890
go to the exhibits as
its own thing. Like you

380
00:18:39.890 --> 00:18:41.840
didn't make it a side
effect like, Oh yeah. And

381
00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:46.220
then in your copious spare
time stuff, it's literally like

382
00:18:46.580 --> 00:18:48.980
there's all the workshops and
the talks and multiple tracks.

383
00:18:49.070 --> 00:18:51.890
And then you've called out
about, you know, 45 minutes

384
00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:54.920
almost as if exhibit hall
is its own talk. Yeah,

385
00:18:55.580 --> 00:18:59.120
absolutely. Yeah. Our sponsors are
incredibly important. I mean, literally

386
00:18:59.410 --> 00:19:01.970
if you look at the
finances, the ticket costs do

387
00:19:01.970 --> 00:19:05.330
not cover the cost of
conference. The ticket prices don't

388
00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:09.050
even like not even at
all. And that's very intentional

389
00:19:09.050 --> 00:19:10.760
because we want to make
sure the tickets are very

390
00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:13.820
affordable and very accessible for
folks. But what that means

391
00:19:13.820 --> 00:19:16.760
is that we are relying
very, very heavily on sponsors

392
00:19:17.030 --> 00:19:19.460
to make sure that we
can have a conference and

393
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.250
we can make that sustainable.
So our sponsors are super

394
00:19:22.250 --> 00:19:24.920
important to us, but the
other thing is our sponsors

395
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:27.920
are genuinely excited to be
there. They're excited to meet

396
00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:31.100
folks. They want an opportunity
to show what they're offering,

397
00:19:31.100 --> 00:19:33.620
whether that's a product, whether
that's a job, a lot

398
00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.260
of folks come to recruit,
you know, their, their first

399
00:19:36.500 --> 00:19:39.980
developers, junior developers, that sort
of thing. And they're really

400
00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:41.960
excited. We have bootcamps who
are onsite, who want to

401
00:19:41.960 --> 00:19:45.890
share the resources that they
have available. So the sponsors

402
00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:48.170
are like, they're good people,
you know, they're good companies

403
00:19:48.170 --> 00:19:49.940
or folks who want to
help. We want to be

404
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.010
part of this community. So
it makes total sense to

405
00:19:52.010 --> 00:19:55.490
give them an opportunity to
do so. Hmm. I am

406
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:57.680
really looking forward to this.
I've I'm worried a little

407
00:19:57.680 --> 00:19:59.120
bit that we're going to
end up turning this into

408
00:19:59.570 --> 00:20:01.500
a big, long half an
hour advertisement for code land,

409
00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:05.180
but I don't feel too
bad about that. I go

410
00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:07.280
to so many conferences. I'm
very lucky that part of

411
00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.760
my job is going to
attend conferences and stuff to

412
00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:14.990
find one where I'm actually
spending time listening to talks

413
00:20:14.990 --> 00:20:17.750
and not just hanging out
in the hallway is also

414
00:20:17.750 --> 00:20:21.140
like really significant there's. So
they're so curated the order

415
00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:22.820
of them. It's almost as
if the day has a

416
00:20:22.820 --> 00:20:26.600
story arc that you're trying
to tell us. Yep. Yeah.

417
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:29.840
You nailed it. Did you
plan that you like, Are

418
00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:32.060
you sitting there like with
a, I imagine that somewhere

419
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:35.900
in surrounds apartment is like
posted notes. Like, you know,

420
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:37.790
then this one goes and
that one goes and how

421
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:40.090
do people feel after they've
exited this one and what

422
00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:42.740
do we do to freshen
them, freshen them up after

423
00:20:42.740 --> 00:20:44.360
this? You know, like you
said, there was an intense

424
00:20:44.360 --> 00:20:47.920
talk, you nailed it really.
Oh, wow. Yeah. You know

425
00:20:47.920 --> 00:20:49.720
that, Not so much sticky
notes, we have a spreadsheet,

426
00:20:49.720 --> 00:20:52.240
but yeah, that's exactly it.
We started with, you know,

427
00:20:52.240 --> 00:20:54.250
what is a good warmup
top? What's a good talk

428
00:20:54.250 --> 00:20:55.870
to kind of put you
in a good mood to

429
00:20:55.870 --> 00:20:58.240
get you excited to get
you, you know, in the

430
00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:00.970
right head space to be
open and accepting of other

431
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:03.460
ideas. And so we're kicking
it off with the laughter

432
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:05.470
is the most serious weapon
talk that I talked about

433
00:21:05.500 --> 00:21:07.930
earlier. And then we go
into, okay, now how do

434
00:21:07.930 --> 00:21:10.540
we really go into something
a little bit more serious,

435
00:21:10.540 --> 00:21:12.400
a little bit more, you
know, really showing off the

436
00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:14.740
technology and getting in the
weeds about the technical stuff

437
00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:17.580
to kind of prime you
to accept even more the,

438
00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:21.670
the technical, the technically challenging
talks that we do have.

439
00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:23.980
And for that, we have
a talk called drone aide

440
00:21:23.980 --> 00:21:26.770
by Petro Cruz, who talks
about how we created this

441
00:21:26.770 --> 00:21:30.970
drone. That's able to spot
people who are in unfortunate

442
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.790
situations during a natural disaster.
So it's basically like a

443
00:21:33.790 --> 00:21:37.450
rescue mission, but with drones.
And so that's a great

444
00:21:37.450 --> 00:21:39.370
like talk that makes you
go, Holy crap, you can

445
00:21:39.370 --> 00:21:42.370
do that with technology. There's
a single person who created

446
00:21:42.370 --> 00:21:44.860
this whole app, this whole
system for rescuing people, you

447
00:21:44.860 --> 00:21:48.400
know, it really helps really
drive home the power of

448
00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.680
technology and makes you even
more excited to hear about

449
00:21:50.890 --> 00:21:52.690
the other talks and the
other ideas that you're going

450
00:21:52.690 --> 00:21:54.820
to be presented with. And
so from there we move

451
00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.250
into, okay, now that we
have a chunk of talks,

452
00:21:57.550 --> 00:21:59.440
what's the right balance, right?
One of the things that

453
00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:02.410
I've noticed in going to
conferences myself is frankly, they

454
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:04.600
can be exhausting. You know,
it can be really tough

455
00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:07.990
to kind of sit through
three hardcore technical talks back

456
00:22:07.990 --> 00:22:10.600
to back. So at, during
the talk section, the idea

457
00:22:10.600 --> 00:22:12.190
is to go back and
forth. What is something a

458
00:22:12.190 --> 00:22:14.200
little bit more serious? What's
the thing a little bit

459
00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:17.080
lighter. What's something more personal.
What's something that is more

460
00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.390
technical. So we try to
have a nice blend of

461
00:22:19.390 --> 00:22:21.430
that so that you never
feel fatigued. It's not too

462
00:22:21.430 --> 00:22:24.310
much cognitive overload for you.
And then the ending of

463
00:22:24.310 --> 00:22:26.560
course, is you. You're a
closing speaker. You're going to

464
00:22:26.560 --> 00:22:29.440
give an amazing, amazing, very
personal talk that I think

465
00:22:29.440 --> 00:22:33.070
will really help close and
solidify all the different lessons

466
00:22:33.070 --> 00:22:35.560
and the different parts of
the conference. It gets them

467
00:22:35.560 --> 00:22:38.680
really excited about. Wow, now
that I've experienced all these

468
00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:40.750
different stories, I'm going to
go home and I'm going

469
00:22:40.750 --> 00:22:42.280
to do something about it.
And I think your talk

470
00:22:42.280 --> 00:22:43.930
is going to be the
great, the best way to

471
00:22:43.930 --> 00:22:47.070
end. I appreciate that. I'm
trying to think of it

472
00:22:47.070 --> 00:22:49.710
as a, as a lock
note, right? The keynote opens

473
00:22:49.710 --> 00:22:52.200
it and the lock note
closes it. Yeah. And I

474
00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:54.080
hope I get it right.
Cause we haven't had our,

475
00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:56.910
our meeting yet for us
to talk about how, how

476
00:22:56.910 --> 00:23:00.840
it will land. But my
goal is I'm imagining a

477
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:03.600
bunch of newbies, a bunch
of people who are finding

478
00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:07.920
their power, they're finding their
power through code. And we're

479
00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:10.170
going to have talks on
software. We're gonna have talks

480
00:23:10.170 --> 00:23:13.680
on hardware. You've got talks
on art and the intersection

481
00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:17.130
of hardware and software. And
I want to talk about

482
00:23:17.130 --> 00:23:22.440
my community of diabetics that
are DIY diabetes people. And

483
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:25.230
I want people to go,
Oh my goodness. I had

484
00:23:25.230 --> 00:23:29.670
no idea that I could
do that with Python and

485
00:23:29.670 --> 00:23:31.980
node and go. And all
of these languages that I'm

486
00:23:31.980 --> 00:23:36.450
using to put databases on,
into, you know, into HTML.

487
00:23:37.050 --> 00:23:40.920
This is running in, in
someone's pocket and literally changing

488
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.010
their life. And I hope
that they leave empowered. Exactly.

489
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:46.640
Yeah. When we talk about
what we want to accomplish

490
00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:49.400
with the conference, we want
people to be, to feel

491
00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:52.190
empowered for short. We want
people to feel activated. We

492
00:23:52.200 --> 00:23:54.200
want them to think now
the conference is over. I

493
00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:56.630
can't wait to get back
to my computer. I can't

494
00:23:56.630 --> 00:23:58.910
wait to get back home
so I can take all

495
00:23:58.910 --> 00:24:01.280
these lessons and these ideas
and really implement them. So

496
00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:03.740
that's one of the biggest
goals of the conference and

497
00:24:03.740 --> 00:24:07.240
I'm very sure you're talking
at all. Yeah. That, that

498
00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:09.640
feeling of like, I need,
like, you want to stay

499
00:24:09.640 --> 00:24:11.140
at the conference, but at
the same time, you also

500
00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:13.510
want to run away because
you could go, I can,

501
00:24:13.630 --> 00:24:15.790
I can go and do
something with this right now.

502
00:24:15.820 --> 00:24:19.000
Yup. Exactly. Want to rush
back to your desk and

503
00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:22.990
figure out how I can
implement this? Yup, absolutely. How

504
00:24:22.990 --> 00:24:25.420
do I not overwhelm them
though? Like, I feel like

505
00:24:25.570 --> 00:24:27.670
it's, there's so much when
you're like you've built the

506
00:24:27.670 --> 00:24:32.530
entire code newbies community. You
have multiple podcasts. You talk

507
00:24:32.530 --> 00:24:35.740
about building communities, make sure
by the way to check

508
00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:39.280
out code newbie.org and the
base CS podcast, the code

509
00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:43.090
newbie podcasts. But when someone's
getting started and I'm struggling

510
00:24:43.090 --> 00:24:44.890
with this with my sons,
I struggle with this. When

511
00:24:44.890 --> 00:24:50.500
I teach a software, how
do I not crush them

512
00:24:50.620 --> 00:24:54.610
with the overwhelming stuff that
they can do? Like there's

513
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:57.100
so much that you can
learn. Like what's the balance

514
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:02.770
between power and just overwhelmed.
I think the key is

515
00:25:02.770 --> 00:25:06.310
to root everything in a
story and in a problem.

516
00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:09.640
So for your, your diabetes
doctor, you're going to do,

517
00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:12.730
it comes from a personal
problem that you had, right.

518
00:25:12.730 --> 00:25:15.220
It comes from your story
and it was you building

519
00:25:15.220 --> 00:25:19.570
a solution for yourself. And
so I think with learning

520
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:22.600
how to code, it's important
to remember, why am I

521
00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:25.810
learning? What is the solution
that I'm going for? What's

522
00:25:25.810 --> 00:25:28.000
the problem that I'm trying
to solve? And I think

523
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:29.800
the more we can remember
that and we can tie

524
00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:33.400
it back to that, less
overwhelming. It feels there's this

525
00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:36.220
really great study that talks
about the difference between people

526
00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:38.860
who finish a computer science
degree and people who start

527
00:25:38.860 --> 00:25:41.920
one and don't finish one.
And the study found that

528
00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:45.520
the biggest difference is that
the people who finish the

529
00:25:45.520 --> 00:25:50.200
degree have a higher tolerance
for basically confusion for things,

530
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:52.270
not really making sense. And
they have the ability to

531
00:25:52.270 --> 00:25:55.120
kind of stomach that and
push through regardless. And so

532
00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:57.160
for me, I am not
good at stomaching that if

533
00:25:57.160 --> 00:25:59.320
things don't make sense, I
get very, very irritated and

534
00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:02.320
very frustrated and I frankly
wouldn't run away. And so

535
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.800
for me, remembering that story,
remembering the, the reason why

536
00:26:05.800 --> 00:26:08.170
I'm doing this and I
don't mean like to make

537
00:26:08.170 --> 00:26:10.990
more money. What I mean
is if I'm learning in

538
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:14.500
your example, if I'm doing
the diabetes, DIY you know,

539
00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:17.740
solution because I'm suffering from
this and I need a

540
00:26:17.740 --> 00:26:21.130
solution for myself, that is
a really great motivator that

541
00:26:21.340 --> 00:26:24.400
allows me to push forward
and to be inspired and

542
00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:26.770
is able to give me
the strength to keep going,

543
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.350
even when I want to
quit. Hmm. You know, I

544
00:26:29.350 --> 00:26:31.150
think that's a really good
point. I think we do

545
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.030
forget the why we stare
at the code. We stare

546
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:37.000
at the syntax error last
night, I was up at

547
00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:40.330
2:00 AM trying to fix a
bug. And I ended up

548
00:26:40.360 --> 00:26:43.140
just saying, literally, there's nothing
more I can do then

549
00:26:43.140 --> 00:26:45.600
sleep. You know what I
mean? Like it was one

550
00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:47.910
of those things where I
think I was probably operating

551
00:26:47.910 --> 00:26:51.120
at 20% optimal. So I
could have stayed up from

552
00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:55.230
2:00 AM to 7:00 AM and hurt
myself and solve the bug.

553
00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.540
But I just went to
bed. I just said, forget

554
00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.040
it. I went to bed
and I'll probably solve it

555
00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:00.600
in an hour when I
get off the phone with

556
00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:04.530
you. But it was the
remembering, why am I doing

557
00:27:04.530 --> 00:27:06.450
this in the first place?
What is the point of

558
00:27:06.450 --> 00:27:09.020
the thing that we're building
that was so important? Yes,

559
00:27:09.020 --> 00:27:13.160
exactly. That context is everything.
Yeah. So people can sign

560
00:27:13.160 --> 00:27:18.980
up at code, land, cough.com.
I think that this, this

561
00:27:19.310 --> 00:27:23.060
podcast is going to come
out on the 6th of June. What

562
00:27:23.060 --> 00:27:25.970
will the prices be? And
other early bird pricing and

563
00:27:25.970 --> 00:27:28.370
the price is going to
go up. Yeah. So right

564
00:27:28.370 --> 00:27:31.310
now we are in our
regular tickets session, I guess,

565
00:27:31.310 --> 00:27:33.830
ticket registration. So tickets are
from nine, nine bucks to

566
00:27:33.830 --> 00:27:37.190
one 69. And then on
June 23rd, they're going to jump

567
00:27:37.190 --> 00:27:40.190
up. They're going to increase.
And so, yeah, if you

568
00:27:40.190 --> 00:27:42.530
were interested in going to
the conference, I highly suggest

569
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.540
you get a ticket before
then. And I hope to

570
00:27:44.540 --> 00:27:47.780
see you there. What is
the pay it forward ticket?

571
00:27:48.550 --> 00:27:50.030
I'm so glad you asked.
So pay it forward is

572
00:27:50.030 --> 00:27:53.090
something I'm super excited about.
It is an opportunity for

573
00:27:53.090 --> 00:27:56.270
folks to pay it forward
for folks who may not

574
00:27:56.270 --> 00:27:58.230
be going to the conference
themselves, or maybe have a,

575
00:27:58.230 --> 00:28:01.070
you know, scheduling conflict, maybe
aren't able to attend, but

576
00:28:01.070 --> 00:28:03.200
who want to give back
and who wants to participate

577
00:28:03.830 --> 00:28:06.380
in, in the community and
in the conference. And so

578
00:28:06.410 --> 00:28:09.860
it allows them to pay,
to pay for someone else

579
00:28:10.070 --> 00:28:13.070
who won't otherwise be able
to afford the conference. So

580
00:28:13.070 --> 00:28:15.770
basically it's a, it's a
ticket donation to our opportunity

581
00:28:15.770 --> 00:28:19.250
scholarship and I'm super excited,
actually change log media group.

582
00:28:19.280 --> 00:28:22.250
They, they bought like five
tickets. And so they're sponsoring

583
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:25.010
five different folks to go
to the conference. We've had

584
00:28:25.010 --> 00:28:27.470
some really good stories of
individuals who've bought. I think

585
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:29.570
one person bought like 10
tickets just as a, just

586
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.720
as a person of anonymously
donated 10 tickets. And so

587
00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:35.480
it's a really great way
for folks to give back

588
00:28:35.750 --> 00:28:39.020
and to support the community
and to make the conference

589
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:41.540
even more accessible. And I
assume that you would welcome

590
00:28:41.540 --> 00:28:44.420
people to do that. Like
last, last year, I think

591
00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:47.510
you did 50 or 55
pay it forward tickets. Certainly

592
00:28:47.510 --> 00:28:49.520
if someone wanted to become
kind of a neuro sets,

593
00:28:49.790 --> 00:28:52.820
defacto sponsor of code and
they could go and buy

594
00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:55.160
10 tickets and then tweet
about it. Absolutely. And we'll

595
00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:56.690
put your name on the
website and we'll give you

596
00:28:56.690 --> 00:28:58.340
a nice shout out from
the stage and say, thank

597
00:28:58.340 --> 00:29:00.440
you so much for helping
us make the conference even

598
00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:03.230
more inclusive. Fantastic. Well, thanks
so much for chatting with

599
00:29:03.230 --> 00:29:05.180
me. Thanks so much for
having me on this is

600
00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:09.020
great. Folks can check out
COVID land carf.com. If you're

601
00:29:09.020 --> 00:29:12.380
listening to this before July 22nd,
which is when code land

602
00:29:12.410 --> 00:29:15.680
is to New York, it's powered
by GitHub and produced by

603
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:19.280
code newbie. And if you're
listening to this after 2019,

604
00:29:19.700 --> 00:29:21.560
I hope that you go
and check out COVID land

605
00:29:21.800 --> 00:29:25.790
20, 40, whatever year in
the future. You're listening to

606
00:29:25.790 --> 00:29:29.000
this and then also check
out code newbie. It's just

607
00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.240
one of the best, most
inclusive communities out there. I

608
00:29:32.240 --> 00:29:35.060
am not a code newbie,
but I hang out with

609
00:29:35.060 --> 00:29:38.360
code newbies. They're just enthusiastic
fun people. There's a Twitter

610
00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:43.030
chat every Wednesday. You are
just a wonderful, and I

611
00:29:43.030 --> 00:29:45.300
appreciate you so much, right?
Thank you so much. I

612
00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:47.160
appreciate all that. And I
appreciate you hanging out with

613
00:29:47.160 --> 00:29:48.750
us. It means a lot
to have people like you

614
00:29:48.750 --> 00:29:50.850
in our community, supporting and
mentoring. So thank you so

615
00:29:50.850 --> 00:29:54.630
much. Certainly my pleasure. This
has been another episode of

616
00:29:54.630 --> 00:29:57.030
Hanselminutes and we'll see you
again next week.
