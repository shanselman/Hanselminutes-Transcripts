That says dashcam.com. Hey, this
is Carl Franklin Hanselman is show

12
00:01:12.630 --> 00:01:15.680
number two, take it away,
Scott. Hi everyone. I really

13
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.260
appreciate all your feedback on
Hansel minutes. Number one, this

14
00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:20.870
is show number two, and
we've got a whole pile

15
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:23.240
of content for you. Don't
recall. Yes, we did. Scott

16
00:01:25.160 --> 00:01:26.660
noticed that Carl is doing
the best he can not

17
00:01:26.660 --> 00:01:30.050
to waste your time. Anybody's
time today, and we've already

18
00:01:30.050 --> 00:01:32.210
wasted about 20 seconds. Let's
get right to it. So

19
00:01:32.210 --> 00:01:35.000
cool stuff this week for
me, I've got a number

20
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:37.040
of different things that I've
been thinking about around hardware

21
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.260
and it's showed up on
the net and a couple

22
00:01:39.260 --> 00:01:41.420
of different places, but I've
been checking out this optimist

23
00:01:41.420 --> 00:01:44.810
keyboard, cause I recently just
bought myself a Microsoft wireless

24
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.350
laser keyboard, 6,000, but this
optimist keyboard is one of

25
00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.560
those things that was done
as a, a student example

26
00:01:51.560 --> 00:01:54.020
or you know, students senior
project. And they're talking about

27
00:01:54.020 --> 00:01:57.200
actually creating it. It's a
keyboard by which every single

28
00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.460
key is a little LCD
color screen. I personally use

29
00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:03.830
an ergo Dex, E R
G O D X or

30
00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:06.830
codex.com, which has a bunch
of blank keys. And you

31
00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:09.290
can actually arrange them any
way that you want. They're

32
00:02:09.290 --> 00:02:11.330
sticky on the back. And
I play things like Guild

33
00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.810
Wars. I've also used it
for code rush to set

34
00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:17.540
up macros. So it's basically
a macro pad with detachable

35
00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:20.000
keys, but the idea that
I could change the look

36
00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.410
and feel of my entire
keyboard just by reprogramming all

37
00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.690
of the, the faces sounds
pretty attractive. And they're saying

38
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.030
it's going to come in
only at about two, $300,

39
00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:31.100
which is right about it.
The amount that my wife

40
00:02:31.100 --> 00:02:33.200
wouldn't notice if I, if
I bought, without telling her

41
00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:35.780
the things Scott that I
find weird about that is

42
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:38.560
that If you have a
different keyboard for every program

43
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.220
You're going to use, you
might have a little trouble

44
00:02:40.220 --> 00:02:42.980
getting used to now, where
is this key right now?

45
00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:45.440
Yeah. Things move around on
you. That could be totally

46
00:02:45.440 --> 00:02:48.020
valid point. But I was
thinking about that. We say

47
00:02:48.020 --> 00:02:50.090
even myself as someone, who's
got a pile of tools,

48
00:02:50.090 --> 00:02:53.420
like my list up at
hanselman.com/tools that I use these

49
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:56.210
1500 programs, but there's a
very crisp kind of power

50
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:58.340
curve where there's like the
top 10 applications that I

51
00:02:58.340 --> 00:03:01.240
use every single day. And
I don't think that I

52
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:04.120
would go and set up
a, a special keyboard for

53
00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:07.050
an application I use twice
a week. Right. You know,

54
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.880
for the totally sick and
twisted, you can go to

55
00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.520
data, hand.com. Have you seen
data hand? I have seen

56
00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.410
the data hand. That was
just a little too strange

57
00:03:13.740 --> 00:03:16.260
for my taste. I think
that occasionally bought one Scott.

58
00:03:16.890 --> 00:03:19.290
Wow. I actually bought one.
I haven't used it. I

59
00:03:19.290 --> 00:03:21.450
tried it. And it's going
to take a lot of

60
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:23.700
practice to get good at
that. Go to data, hand.com.

61
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:26.220
You'll see what I mean
For me, but we will

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.890
see, I'm definitely taking a
look at DAS keyboard, a

63
00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:33.540
dis keyboard.com the blank hackers
keyboard, not just because it's

64
00:03:33.540 --> 00:03:35.220
blank and people would think
you were cool. Cause you

65
00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:37.110
were using a keyboard that
had nothing marked on it.

66
00:03:37.890 --> 00:03:40.140
And it was actually a
lookalike keyboard from Belkin now

67
00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:43.440
because each of the keys
is individually weighted. I've always

68
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.210
found that I have more
pain on my pinky and

69
00:03:45.210 --> 00:03:47.940
my ring finger because all
the keys are weighted at

70
00:03:47.940 --> 00:03:51.960
about, I think, 40 grand,
40 grams or micrograms of

71
00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.180
pressure that is required to
make the key go down.

72
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:57.480
The DAS keyboard actually makes
the keys weighted specifically for

73
00:03:57.480 --> 00:04:00.330
the stronger fingers. So I'm
looking at checking that out

74
00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:02.040
and hopefully have a review
up on my blog pretty

75
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:05.760
soon. Hey, you're into Maine
right? Big time. I've got

76
00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:07.290
a lot of main stuff
running. I've been using a

77
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:11.280
thing called Mame. IEX main
IEX is actually a media

78
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.610
center PC front end for
Mame so that I can

79
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:18.720
actually launch from my media
center, PC this main interface

80
00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:21.360
that lets me select all
the different emulations and games

81
00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:24.300
that I want. And Mamie
X can actually act a

82
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.460
little bit as its own
media center PC. And it

83
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.520
was written in.net, which is
pretty slick. You know, I

84
00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:32.400
think it would be valuable
to describe Maine because I

85
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:34.260
really don't think that a
lot of people know about

86
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:36.030
it. I think a lot
of them are wrong. I

87
00:04:36.030 --> 00:04:37.380
think a lot of people
have heard of it, but

88
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:40.380
a lot of people haven't
actually tried downloading and getting

89
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:43.890
a game to work may
means multi arcade machine emulator.

90
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.960
And there's a number of
it started out in dos.

91
00:04:45.990 --> 00:04:49.770
There's a number of different
there's main for windows. Mame

92
00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:52.440
is an opensource thing that's
written entirely in C. So

93
00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.050
it's been poured into almost
every platform. There's a Mac

94
00:04:55.050 --> 00:05:00.030
specific name, a Linux name
there's maim for the, I

95
00:05:00.030 --> 00:05:02.370
believe that there's even main
for like the iPod. And

96
00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:05.910
someone's anytime a small device
comes out to really prove

97
00:05:05.910 --> 00:05:08.130
that we can hack that
device. Someone tries to port

98
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:11.760
things over via Mame. And
interestingly as machines are getting

99
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.040
more and more powerful and
languages are getting more and

100
00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:17.010
more powerful, more and more
stuff is being set up

101
00:05:17.010 --> 00:05:22.290
to emulate Mame. Like I
was up@gamehyphenoldies.com. It's an emulation

102
00:05:22.290 --> 00:05:25.200
website that basically gives you
maim anywhere, anytime in a

103
00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:28.830
browser using the Java runtime.
And you can go and

104
00:05:28.830 --> 00:05:30.960
pick up games. I don't
know what the legality of

105
00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:33.000
that is, but that doesn't
mean I won't play them

106
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:34.740
as much as I can
until they get shut down.

107
00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.920
There's always been a gray
area around Mame ROMs because

108
00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:40.410
they are essentially poor, you
know, ripped rums, right from

109
00:05:40.410 --> 00:05:44.340
the original arcade machine. Exactly.
And technically you're only supposed

110
00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:46.620
to run the main game
if you actually have that

111
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:51.060
full upright, you know, $5,000
version of donkey Kong jr.

112
00:05:51.060 --> 00:05:53.880
And your base and then
you are legally. Okay. But

113
00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:56.850
I think even technically, according
to digital millennium, copyright law,

114
00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:00.200
if someone was downtown downstairs
playing your donkey Kong game

115
00:06:00.290 --> 00:06:01.880
at the same time you
were on the emulator, you

116
00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:04.420
would not be allowed to
play that. Huh? It's a

117
00:06:04.420 --> 00:06:07.600
very, very gray area, but
I was still pretty impressed.

118
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:11.740
Okay. So what is this
a PSP like device you

119
00:06:11.740 --> 00:06:13.420
were talking about? Do we
have a link for that?

120
00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:16.030
And speaking of that, where
are all the links? So

121
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:18.190
all the links right now,
we've been using different things

122
00:06:18.190 --> 00:06:23.260
like shrink stir Earl x.org,
Earl one, two, three.com. Last

123
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:25.900
time we use tiny Earl
for now for this show,

124
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:28.090
let's give this a try.
This is show number two.

125
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:30.340
All of the links will
be up at the show.

126
00:06:30.340 --> 00:06:33.910
Number two, section of Hansel
minutes.com. You can go up

127
00:06:33.910 --> 00:06:36.370
there and find it. And
I'll probably also put some

128
00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.060
of the links up at
delicious Del dot I C

129
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:42.340
I O dot U S.
And I'll talk more about

130
00:06:42.340 --> 00:06:46.270
delicious and show number three,
but this PSP like devices

131
00:06:46.810 --> 00:06:49.150
up in a ceo.uk. So
I won't even bother reading

132
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:50.920
it to you, but the
device is called a GP

133
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.320
to X, and this is
a small $200 Linux-based device.

134
00:06:56.380 --> 00:07:00.820
It's not quite the, the
chutzpah that a PSP has,

135
00:07:00.970 --> 00:07:03.520
but it's a small portable
handheld device that runs Linux

136
00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:06.460
and people are using it
as a, wouldn't say a

137
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.820
poor man's PSP, but definitely
kind of the hacker friendly

138
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.060
PSP people have been struggling
with this wrestling back and

139
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.160
forth as Sony tries to
shut them down and the

140
00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:19.660
home brew applications keep coming
back. This device actually comes

141
00:07:19.660 --> 00:07:23.290
with an SDK and says,
please hack me as such.

142
00:07:23.320 --> 00:07:26.890
They've come up with Mame
doom, ports, quake ports for

143
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:31.150
this thing. And it's, it's
actually working out pretty nicely.

144
00:07:31.150 --> 00:07:33.340
I think that the price
point is right. A couple

145
00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:35.590
hundred dollars is right about
where the geeks can handle

146
00:07:35.590 --> 00:07:39.970
it and porting things over
to that like video players

147
00:07:39.970 --> 00:07:42.460
and other Linux software is
happening. I really had a

148
00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:45.820
very fast pace. So if
you're thinking about a PSP,

149
00:07:45.850 --> 00:07:49.060
maybe check out the <inaudible>,
it might be more what

150
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:51.280
you're wanting to do. I
mean, the biggest problem with

151
00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.800
buying a piece of hardware
like that for portable gameplay

152
00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.360
is you get the games
that are made for it.

153
00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:57.820
And that's it. This seems
to be really, really cool

154
00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:00.760
hackers delight. Now I personally
bought a PSP because I'm

155
00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:02.890
really less interested in the
games and more interested in

156
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:06.430
the video aspects. I bought
a PSP as an inexpensive

157
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.670
portable media center because I
felt at the time, this

158
00:08:09.670 --> 00:08:12.820
was last year that the
media center portables from Microsoft

159
00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:15.490
just were a little too
expensive. I couldn't justify $400.

160
00:08:15.970 --> 00:08:20.950
I could justify less for
a PSP and up@furrygoat.com. These

161
00:08:20.950 --> 00:08:24.970
taken advantage of this wireless
built in wifi that the

162
00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:27.940
PSP has. And he's actually
got 20 gigs of external

163
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:33.070
storage set up. So he's
actually downloading stuff and his

164
00:08:33.070 --> 00:08:35.530
own kind of internal wifi
network. So even though he's

165
00:08:35.530 --> 00:08:38.800
got a one gig memory
card for videos and such,

166
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.830
he can go up and
download new, fresh content from

167
00:08:41.830 --> 00:08:44.500
his 20 gig external drive.
Basically what he did is

168
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.590
he found a drive enclosure
that takes laptop hard drives,

169
00:08:47.770 --> 00:08:50.500
but the enclosure also acts
as a, as a Nass,

170
00:08:50.510 --> 00:08:53.950
as a network attached storage.
And the drive enclosure actually

171
00:08:53.950 --> 00:08:56.700
has wifi built in. And
since it has wifi and

172
00:08:56.700 --> 00:08:59.610
the PSP has wifi, he
worked out some kind of

173
00:08:59.610 --> 00:09:02.220
Unix hacking and some scripts
to, to have those guys

174
00:09:02.220 --> 00:09:04.860
talk to each other, tasty.
It is, it's pretty nice.

175
00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.590
It's at frigo.com. We'll have
the full link at the

176
00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:10.140
Hanselman. It's show number two.
Now that's a little too

177
00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:14.010
hardcore for me, but as
we're podcasts and anatomy, if

178
00:09:14.010 --> 00:09:17.670
it's pretty hardcore, if it
involves running VI, I've pretty

179
00:09:17.670 --> 00:09:20.990
much given those things up
Pico, but I can't run

180
00:09:20.990 --> 00:09:23.090
VI anymore. Right? So, and
also we had a correction

181
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:25.280
about something you said about
the video on the Xbox

182
00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.700
three 60 last week, right
now, a lot of different

183
00:09:28.700 --> 00:09:31.850
stuff with the Xbox three
60, I've been downloading audio.

184
00:09:31.850 --> 00:09:34.190
I've been watching video, but
I've been doing the video

185
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.210
watching via the media center,
extender technology. The idea that

186
00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:42.890
you can remote desktop into
a media center PC, this

187
00:09:42.890 --> 00:09:46.190
is the windows XP media
center edition. And you basically

188
00:09:46.190 --> 00:09:49.130
get a complete experience as
if you were sitting in

189
00:09:49.130 --> 00:09:52.520
front of the media center.
This is not the watered

190
00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:54.950
down media center, extender stuff
of the past. The Xbox

191
00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:58.700
three 60 is actually updated.
There's a specific update for

192
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:01.850
the, the windows XP media
center, PC edition called roll

193
00:10:01.850 --> 00:10:04.760
up to that gives you
this functionality, but you can

194
00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:08.600
only watch video either a
that's downloaded from the Xbox

195
00:10:08.600 --> 00:10:12.620
live marketplace, which is content
that Microsoft supports and puts

196
00:10:12.620 --> 00:10:15.830
up there or B via
this remoting. So you need

197
00:10:15.830 --> 00:10:18.860
to have this, this functionality
set up on a media

198
00:10:18.860 --> 00:10:20.930
center, PC I've set one
up and put it in

199
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:24.890
a closet. It looks nice.
Oh, it looks fantastic. It

200
00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.430
looks absolutely fantastic. And since
we're talking about podcasting, we're

201
00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:31.310
on a podcast. Now you
can do video casting. The

202
00:10:31.310 --> 00:10:34.640
tool called video era and
video era is basically a

203
00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:37.670
pilot I'm casting application that
downloads video, and then does

204
00:10:37.670 --> 00:10:39.980
something with the video. Once
it's come down, a lot

205
00:10:39.980 --> 00:10:43.670
of people use it for
video casting to their PSP.

206
00:10:43.790 --> 00:10:46.190
There's a number of different
TV shows that you can

207
00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:49.670
download that are kind of
underground TV shows, they're often

208
00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:54.200
index format or formats that
aren't necessarily Microsoft friendly video,

209
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.990
or we'll actually bring this
content down and either squish

210
00:10:56.990 --> 00:11:01.760
it and put it onto
your PSP automatically, or it

211
00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.740
will squish it and put
it into a folder and

212
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:06.290
set it up ready to
be watched from an Xbox

213
00:11:06.290 --> 00:11:09.890
three 60 via media center.
But if you're not into

214
00:11:09.920 --> 00:11:14.660
kind of that packaged experience@brainsandbrawn.com,
and again, that's a link

215
00:11:14.660 --> 00:11:17.210
we'll put up at Hansel
minutes. Casey Chestnut has got

216
00:11:17.210 --> 00:11:20.390
instructions on how to download
Devex, which is a very

217
00:11:20.540 --> 00:11:24.770
highly compressed MPEG, four format,
Devex Kodak videos, and actually

218
00:11:24.770 --> 00:11:29.210
do on the fly transcoding
from those Devex format to

219
00:11:29.210 --> 00:11:31.610
a WMV, which then could
be watched on your three

220
00:11:31.610 --> 00:11:34.730
60 via the media center
extender. Wow, that's cool. I've

221
00:11:34.730 --> 00:11:36.230
had a number of people
come over to the place

222
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:38.330
and I've shown them. They
asked box three 60 and

223
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:41.120
they've actually said, I'm not
interested in the games just

224
00:11:41.120 --> 00:11:42.620
as I'm not interested in
the games in the PSP

225
00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:44.810
that much. They said, you're
saying I could fill my

226
00:11:44.810 --> 00:11:46.790
house with an Xbox three
60 in each room and

227
00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:50.480
have a video extend our
experience in each room. And

228
00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.380
I think we're getting to
that place. They've snuck thing

229
00:11:53.380 --> 00:11:55.900
into our house and it
is going to become a

230
00:11:55.900 --> 00:12:00.540
media hub without us even,
even realizing it and Google

231
00:12:00.540 --> 00:12:02.130
stuff. You got a lot
of Google stuff to talk

232
00:12:02.130 --> 00:12:04.470
about this week, right? You
know, Google, their motto is,

233
00:12:04.470 --> 00:12:06.600
do no evil, but you
know, I don't know how

234
00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.300
someone could bring out such
good software so much. So

235
00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:11.520
often it's like every five
minutes they've got something going

236
00:12:11.520 --> 00:12:14.340
out on their site without
at least having celled sold

237
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:18.120
one of their souls, maybe
surrogate to the devil because

238
00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:21.660
Google pack is fantastic. It's,
it's basically, you know, Google

239
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.150
update just like we've got
Microsoft update. And that came

240
00:12:24.150 --> 00:12:26.730
out recently. And I hope
that rather than using it

241
00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:29.430
as a venue for pushing
commercial software out, they use

242
00:12:29.430 --> 00:12:31.500
it as a venue for
getting good open source software

243
00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:33.660
out there. But it's Google
earth. That's really been impressing

244
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.880
the heck out of me.
And there's a website called

245
00:12:36.150 --> 00:12:41.010
FBO web.com that has got
flight tracking in Google earth.

246
00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:43.530
Now we're talking about Google
earth here, not Google maps,

247
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.160
Google earth is the 3d
topography. They take all of

248
00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:50.880
this information. They layer on
the topography, the satellite data

249
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:55.590
during hurricane Katrina, they brought
up NOAA data and they've

250
00:12:55.590 --> 00:12:59.010
got flight tracking, working even
with altitude. So you can

251
00:12:59.010 --> 00:13:02.670
take your virtual earth and
twist it and actually watch

252
00:13:02.670 --> 00:13:06.330
the planes, the virtual planes
landing. And I'm all about

253
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:08.970
the flight tracking software. I've
got relatives that come in

254
00:13:08.970 --> 00:13:12.660
from Africa every year. And
we always watch for two

255
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.180
days with kind of wrapped
attention as we see their,

256
00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:19.350
their flights coming over from,
from Johannesburg. Now on the

257
00:13:19.350 --> 00:13:22.320
Google maps side, of course,
the flat The world is

258
00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.440
flat part of Google, Lots
and lots of different Google

259
00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.560
mashups. You can do these
mashups also with virtual ERs,

260
00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:34.680
which Microsoft's virtual mapping software,
but package mapper.com is such

261
00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:38.760
a fantastically useful thing. I'm
constantly trying to see where

262
00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:41.250
my packages are. And I
usually just have that little

263
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.590
boring grid that you see
at ups that says here,

264
00:13:43.590 --> 00:13:46.560
it's in, it's in Poughkeepsie.
Now you can actually have

265
00:13:46.680 --> 00:13:49.410
a pushpin show up with
a where it is, how

266
00:13:49.410 --> 00:13:53.190
it's getting there and a
visual representation of where your

267
00:13:53.190 --> 00:13:58.230
packages up@packagemapper.com, you know, and
actually another one off the

268
00:13:58.230 --> 00:14:03.060
top of my head is
<inaudible> virtual places as kind

269
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:07.470
of a playground for Ajax
and Microsoft asp.net two O

270
00:14:07.530 --> 00:14:10.950
Atlas, a preview of their
Ajax technology. And Nikki is

271
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.890
doing some pretty amazing stuff.
And it's almost all a

272
00:14:13.890 --> 00:14:18.480
mashup with virtual earth. His
site is hosting it and

273
00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.590
photos, geo location. You can
go to Portland, Oregon on

274
00:14:22.590 --> 00:14:25.200
the map there, zoom in
and say, show me RSS

275
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:27.900
feeds that are in this
general area. And it'll actually

276
00:14:27.900 --> 00:14:32.460
put a little XML, RSS
orange badge at the location

277
00:14:32.490 --> 00:14:35.220
and latitude and longitude that
you have. Geotagged your particular

278
00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:38.460
feed to say you locate
at this geotagging is actually

279
00:14:38.460 --> 00:14:40.110
something that you can do
to your RSS feed to

280
00:14:40.110 --> 00:14:44.310
say, Oh, I am broadcasting
quote, unquote broadcasting from this

281
00:14:44.310 --> 00:14:47.010
particular location. So I get
to see what other bloggers

282
00:14:47.010 --> 00:14:50.250
are in Portland. It's pretty
fantastic stuff. That's awesome. And

283
00:14:50.250 --> 00:14:53.270
speaking of Portland, something going
on with Google, Justin Portland.

284
00:14:53.470 --> 00:14:56.590
Yeah. TriMet is the transit
authority in Portland, and they've

285
00:14:56.590 --> 00:14:59.710
always been very kind of
forward looking in their technology

286
00:14:59.710 --> 00:15:02.800
views and their it department
is really fantastic. The TriMet

287
00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:08.020
website@try-met.org has always had some
really neat Java. Applets JavaScript

288
00:15:08.050 --> 00:15:09.640
things to pop up and
tell you when you need

289
00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:13.000
to go running for the,
for the bus. But Google

290
00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:15.760
maps has actually set up
a Google transit site and

291
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:19.600
they're initially interfacing with data
from TriMet. So when you

292
00:15:19.600 --> 00:15:24.400
do directions, you always go
up@mapquestormaps.google.com. And you say, get

293
00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.900
me from point a to
point B. And they always

294
00:15:25.900 --> 00:15:28.090
kind of assume that you're
going to be driving in

295
00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:31.870
a car with transit. They
interface with TriMet and they

296
00:15:31.870 --> 00:15:35.380
say, walk three miles West,
stop here, get on this

297
00:15:35.380 --> 00:15:38.440
particular bus, take the train,
yada yada yada, all these

298
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:41.320
things. And even they tell
you how much money you

299
00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:47.110
will save taking transit mass
transit versus versus taking a

300
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:49.720
car. So they'll say would
cost you a dollar 85

301
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.730
in gas, but it cost
you a buck, you know,

302
00:15:51.740 --> 00:15:54.370
Bucko five to take the,
take the train. I think

303
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:56.050
that they're gonna start expanding
that out. And I think

304
00:15:56.050 --> 00:15:58.180
that for, for new Yorkers,
if they could figure out

305
00:15:58.180 --> 00:16:00.850
a way to interface with
the Metro system in New York,

306
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:04.060
the idea that I could
come in from Brooklyn, either

307
00:16:04.060 --> 00:16:05.890
in my car and park
and factor in all those

308
00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.260
kinds of things, or I
could take the train, it

309
00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.120
could be a real coup
for new Yorkers trying to

310
00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:12.880
find direction Serious, serious. Time-saver
yeah. I hope to see

311
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.770
that in other States. Totally.
And speaking of time, savers,

312
00:16:16.330 --> 00:16:19.990
portable apps.com. Yeah. Lately I've
been all about trying to

313
00:16:19.990 --> 00:16:23.050
have my, my life on
a, on a, on a

314
00:16:23.050 --> 00:16:25.660
USB key. I wrote on
my blog recently about a

315
00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.000
getaway key. Like if, you
know, if your house blew

316
00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.250
up and you needed to
get away, what would you

317
00:16:30.250 --> 00:16:32.260
put on a USB key
to, to run away and

318
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.960
make sure that you could
get things handled, even though

319
00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.180
your house had been destroyed.
And I started looking for

320
00:16:37.180 --> 00:16:39.640
different things you can put
on your USB key and

321
00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:43.510
portable apps.com is this great
website that has got all

322
00:16:43.510 --> 00:16:46.960
sorts of applications that run
via basically an X copy,

323
00:16:46.960 --> 00:16:50.050
deploy there, you copy them
onto your USB key things

324
00:16:50.050 --> 00:16:54.550
like Firefox things like a
Sunbird the calendaring application Thunderbird

325
00:16:55.570 --> 00:16:58.210
open office, and you run
them directly off your USB

326
00:16:58.210 --> 00:17:00.760
key. You never know when
you're going to find a

327
00:17:00.760 --> 00:17:03.220
person's machine. They've got Microsoft
works on it. You go

328
00:17:03.220 --> 00:17:06.130
to your mom's house, you
carry your data with you

329
00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:08.500
on your USB key. Why
not carry some of your

330
00:17:08.500 --> 00:17:11.050
applications? So now do you
have to boot up, do

331
00:17:11.060 --> 00:17:12.640
you have to boot up
a version of Linux that's

332
00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:14.800
on the key two or
No, these are all the

333
00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:17.290
windows versions of these open
source apps. Oh, the windows

334
00:17:17.290 --> 00:17:21.280
versions. Okay. Yeah. Totally portable.
So for example, sometimes you

335
00:17:21.280 --> 00:17:23.230
might go, it might be
traveling, you know, again, when

336
00:17:23.230 --> 00:17:25.810
we traveled in Africa a
lot, oftentimes we don't bring

337
00:17:25.810 --> 00:17:28.480
our laptop because wifi is
not pervasive. So we'll go

338
00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:31.390
to a cyber cafe and
I don't have access to

339
00:17:31.390 --> 00:17:34.450
their machine. I can't go
as administrator and start installing

340
00:17:34.450 --> 00:17:36.910
things. And they're looking over
my shoulder, but I might

341
00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:40.180
have a chat program and
a version of a word

342
00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:42.820
processor. They don't have Excel
because they didn't buy a

343
00:17:42.820 --> 00:17:44.950
license. So I've got open
office right there on my

344
00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:47.290
key. So why not take
your apps along with your

345
00:17:47.290 --> 00:17:50.640
data? Have you ever had
a, just out Of curiosity

346
00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:53.070
where you've been told to
not run that because that's

347
00:17:53.070 --> 00:17:55.670
not an app that's on
our computer. I have had

348
00:17:55.670 --> 00:17:59.360
situations where they caught me
downloading stuff. I have had

349
00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:01.640
situations where they spotted me
poking around on the registry.

350
00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:16.850

So who, who is RIAA

373
00:20:03.380 --> 00:20:05.690
and what is it solid?
But I believe it's actually

374
00:20:05.690 --> 00:20:08.390
the name of the Indian
gentleman who, who runs this

375
00:20:08.390 --> 00:20:10.640
site. It's the name of
his daughter, and this is

376
00:20:10.850 --> 00:20:13.280
a photo site, like a
photo sharing site, you know,

377
00:20:13.310 --> 00:20:17.240
kind of in the realm
of the Shutterfly's, the Snapfish

378
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:21.230
and the smug mug. But,
but this RIAA is actually

379
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:25.610
a more of an AI
and intelligence experiment than a

380
00:20:25.610 --> 00:20:28.310
photo sharing experiment. A lot
of times we want to

381
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:32.150
tag our data, tag our
photos with information. I know

382
00:20:32.150 --> 00:20:36.170
that I've used, Picasa the
free photo sharing application from

383
00:20:36.170 --> 00:20:38.540
Google. And I've wanted to
say, well, I'll go through

384
00:20:38.540 --> 00:20:41.510
and find pictures of grandma
tagged them as grandma find

385
00:20:41.510 --> 00:20:44.480
pictures of <inaudible> Denzo. And
then if I can want

386
00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.890
to find pictures with bababababa
and tagging, never because the

387
00:20:47.890 --> 00:20:52.180
data typically gets a sloppy.
You don't tag a photo,

388
00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:55.060
you miss tag a photo.
What this RIAA attempts to

389
00:20:55.060 --> 00:21:00.280
do is look at the
photos and actually recognize faces.

390
00:21:00.970 --> 00:21:04.410
It'll ask you. Who is
that? That's uncle Phil. Oh,

391
00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.350
are these five of uncle
Phil? Okay, cool. I got

392
00:21:07.350 --> 00:21:09.180
a pretty good idea of
what uncle Phil looks like,

393
00:21:09.810 --> 00:21:12.300
and it'll find them in
low light and highlight. Now

394
00:21:12.300 --> 00:21:15.320
it's all and invite only
alpha right now, but on

395
00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:18.960
Malique on his website was
recently wondering out loud if

396
00:21:18.990 --> 00:21:21.540
Google was going to buy
these people and whether Google

397
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:23.040
buys them or not, or
whether they do their own

398
00:21:23.040 --> 00:21:27.450
thing. The idea that, that
this kind of analysis could

399
00:21:27.450 --> 00:21:30.240
be done on a picture
just really opens up the,

400
00:21:31.360 --> 00:21:34.130
the possibilities. And if you
take that along with the,

401
00:21:34.130 --> 00:21:37.740
the tagging and meta database
technology, that's coming in Longhorn

402
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:40.950
now called Vista and there,
when F when Fs file

403
00:21:40.950 --> 00:21:44.220
system, why can't my PC
rather than doing SETI at

404
00:21:44.220 --> 00:21:46.500
home and trying to find
aliens in its spare time,

405
00:21:46.830 --> 00:21:50.130
be chewing on my pictures
and saying, Oh, I recognize

406
00:21:50.130 --> 00:21:52.800
that this is Christmas 2005,
and here's a bunch of

407
00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.950
different pictures of trees or
whatever. So that's, that's really

408
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:57.960
insane if you think about
it, you know, it's really

409
00:21:57.960 --> 00:21:59.520
insane. But at the same
time, if you read a

410
00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:01.710
lot of things like, you
know, Phillip K Dick or

411
00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:04.230
science fiction, this is what
they've been telling us. We

412
00:22:04.230 --> 00:22:07.830
were going to have since
computers started. And it's just

413
00:22:07.830 --> 00:22:09.450
a lot harder than I
think a lot of people

414
00:22:09.450 --> 00:22:12.300
really thought. And, you know,
and this was actually why

415
00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:14.940
we bring into things like
this, this mechanical Turk thing

416
00:22:14.940 --> 00:22:17.400
that I was actually talking
to you earlier about Amazon

417
00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.960
mechanical Turk, right? So the
mechanical Turk was a, a

418
00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:24.840
Carney, a carnival act that
was taken around. It was

419
00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:27.420
basically a machine that looked
like a Turkish gentleman, and

420
00:22:27.420 --> 00:22:29.970
it was a robot, but
there was actually a person

421
00:22:29.970 --> 00:22:32.640
hidden in a box. And
you'd ask the mechanical Turk

422
00:22:32.640 --> 00:22:34.920
about your life. And then
a piece of paper would

423
00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:38.430
come out, explaining what, what
he thought about you. And

424
00:22:38.430 --> 00:22:39.780
it was just done with
a guy in a box

425
00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:42.900
with a typewriter, but the
concept of a mechanical Turk

426
00:22:43.800 --> 00:22:47.370
machine that's augmented by humans
has been taken to the

427
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:51.750
next level by Amazon. Who's
actually got a collection of,

428
00:22:51.810 --> 00:22:54.360
I like to call the
Metta elves, you got all

429
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:56.160
these elves out there. These
are all these people who

430
00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.200
have nothing better to do
than to go to. Am

431
00:22:58.200 --> 00:23:00.450
I hot or not? And
click on a radio button?

432
00:23:00.750 --> 00:23:02.940
Why don't we pay them
2 cents to actually do some

433
00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.040
work that would ordinarily cost
us a lot of money.

434
00:23:05.430 --> 00:23:07.080
So if I had a
bunch of pictures, maybe I'm

435
00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:09.480
a real estate agent. I've
got a whole wall of

436
00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:11.190
pictures. And I want to
say, which one of these

437
00:23:11.190 --> 00:23:13.950
pictures is a good shot
at the storefront of this

438
00:23:13.950 --> 00:23:17.670
particular property. I give that
data to Amazon. They loaded

439
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.340
into mechanical Turk and they
say, put it in a

440
00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:22.710
queue. And then these people
who sign up for the

441
00:23:22.710 --> 00:23:25.620
mechanical Turk process go, and
they go up to the

442
00:23:25.680 --> 00:23:27.870
website and it says, is
this a good picture? The

443
00:23:27.870 --> 00:23:30.420
storefront, this, and here's three
versions. And they click a

444
00:23:30.420 --> 00:23:33.570
radio button. And if they're,
if they've done their job,

445
00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.720
right, they get 2 cents. So
one could potentially make a,

446
00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:38.190
you know, I don't know
how fast they are. And

447
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.670
if they're trying not to,
to be sloppy six, seven,

448
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.790
eight, 10 bucks an hour
as a mechanical turret. So

449
00:23:44.790 --> 00:23:48.530
some in, in California types
in a question and somebody

450
00:23:48.530 --> 00:23:51.670
else answers it, basically, that's
what they're doing Right now.

451
00:23:51.670 --> 00:23:55.480
They're doing it with, with
images. So, you know, is

452
00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:57.280
this a picture of, and
they're actually using it as

453
00:23:57.280 --> 00:24:03.100
a test for their maps.amazon.com,
which is Amazon's storefront mapping.

454
00:24:03.250 --> 00:24:06.160
They basically had a number
of vans with GPS is

455
00:24:06.160 --> 00:24:08.950
driving around metropolitan areas, taking
pictures out of the left

456
00:24:08.950 --> 00:24:10.870
and right side of the
van. So then when I

457
00:24:10.870 --> 00:24:13.660
type in, I need to
go to palace bookstore. Not

458
00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:16.120
only did they give me
a directions, but they also

459
00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.310
say, and here's a picture
of Powell. So you know

460
00:24:18.310 --> 00:24:20.500
it, when you see it,
huh? So then they will,

461
00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:23.290
they're using this now rather
than having a computer, try

462
00:24:23.290 --> 00:24:25.210
to figure out if that's
a good shot of pals

463
00:24:25.210 --> 00:24:27.610
bookstore, right. Put it into
the queue. So it's really

464
00:24:27.610 --> 00:24:31.210
a test of this queuing
technology that they've got. And

465
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:33.940
you're going to see that
expanded out to other kinds

466
00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:37.480
of problems that a lot
like Google answers, where you

467
00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:39.430
can go up and ask
a question and pay $5

468
00:24:39.430 --> 00:24:42.640
for it. When you really
want processing power. And like

469
00:24:42.640 --> 00:24:46.210
these rhea.com people, they can
get it working 99%, but

470
00:24:46.210 --> 00:24:48.850
they're always going to miss
pictures of uncle Phil. Why

471
00:24:48.850 --> 00:24:51.400
can't the elves, the Metta
elves out there. Do that

472
00:24:51.400 --> 00:24:55.030
for me. Hmm. Awesome. All
right, one more. And then

473
00:24:55.030 --> 00:24:59.320
let's talk bugs. zazzle.com. You
can have pictures and pictures

474
00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:01.240
with people's faces on it.
I was really impressed with

475
00:25:01.270 --> 00:25:05.440
zazzle.com <inaudible> dot com because
I could go up and

476
00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:08.590
actually purchase postage with the
picture of my son on

477
00:25:08.590 --> 00:25:11.440
it. Fantastic stuff costs about
twice. As much as a

478
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:14.230
regular stamp stamps are up
to 40 cents. I think I

479
00:25:14.230 --> 00:25:16.690
paid 80 cents, 90 cents a stamp,
but I get a nice

480
00:25:16.690 --> 00:25:19.300
big fat stamp with a
two dimensional barcode on it.

481
00:25:19.630 --> 00:25:22.060
Each stamp is unique. So
you can't do these yourself.

482
00:25:22.690 --> 00:25:25.660
It's all done through Pitney
Bowes, but Zazzle licenses the

483
00:25:25.670 --> 00:25:28.150
stuff. I know things like
this have been done before,

484
00:25:28.150 --> 00:25:30.880
but the age AXI interface
that they had set up,

485
00:25:30.880 --> 00:25:34.450
it worked great in Firefox.
Literally in five minutes, I

486
00:25:34.450 --> 00:25:36.310
had this thing set up.
I had my sheet of

487
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:38.920
stamps. I can design it.
And then it showed up

488
00:25:38.920 --> 00:25:41.620
like two days later. So
it was like Shutterfly, except

489
00:25:41.620 --> 00:25:43.990
it's got postage. We're doing
all of our baby. Thank

490
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.830
you notes with a zazzle.com
snaps. Very cool. Very cool.

491
00:25:48.430 --> 00:25:50.770
All right. So what kind
of bugs did we encounter

492
00:25:50.770 --> 00:25:53.410
this week, Scott? Well, I
was pretty much bug free

493
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:55.810
at work. Not because we
write bug free code, but

494
00:25:55.810 --> 00:25:58.300
because I wasn't writing code
this week, but I'm going

495
00:25:58.300 --> 00:25:59.830
to take advantage of some
of my friends and some

496
00:25:59.830 --> 00:26:02.680
of the bugs that they
came up with. John box,

497
00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:05.200
who's got a blog up
a John box dot.net developers,

498
00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:10.570
journal.com. Again, all links will
be up@thehanselminutes.com show site. This

499
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:13.840
is show number two. John
box had a really crazy

500
00:26:13.840 --> 00:26:17.770
bug where he was finding
on a particular machine. The

501
00:26:17.770 --> 00:26:20.530
cookies were getting dropped. He
was trying to do some

502
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.340
very basic asp.net forms authentication.
You've got a nice reproduction

503
00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:26.440
set up where he would
go to a site as

504
00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:30.520
an anonymous user login cookie
doesn't show up. So then

505
00:26:30.520 --> 00:26:33.310
he starts sniffing that stuff.
When you find these kinds

506
00:26:33.310 --> 00:26:35.740
of bugs, where you're feeling
that your cookies are being

507
00:26:35.770 --> 00:26:38.410
either slapped down or not
being returned, you want to

508
00:26:38.410 --> 00:26:42.220
pull out a tool like
Fiddler, Fiddler, tool.com or my

509
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:46.200
favorite, which is I HTTP
headers that Jonas Blunck put

510
00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:50.880
together. And these integrate with
IAE and lets you actually

511
00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.950
sniff the traffic that we
don't typically see that that

512
00:26:53.970 --> 00:26:57.150
head or traffic, whether it
be caching, headers or cookies

513
00:26:57.150 --> 00:26:59.880
and stuff. So he actually
posted this up to a

514
00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:02.850
news group that we're on.
And we saw very clearly

515
00:27:02.850 --> 00:27:05.610
that that cookie was being
handed back in. Initially we

516
00:27:05.610 --> 00:27:08.760
were thinking just asp.net somehow.
But if you look at

517
00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:11.730
his, his sniffing, it was
pretty clear that it was

518
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.880
handed to IIE. And on
the next request, I, he

519
00:27:14.880 --> 00:27:17.780
simply didn't hand it back
And it wasn't something dumb,

520
00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.530
like cookies were turned off.
And I know Typically when

521
00:27:21.530 --> 00:27:22.970
you find these kinds of
things out, you want to

522
00:27:22.970 --> 00:27:25.220
look at your are cookies
turned on, what is your

523
00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.130
security set out? If your
security set at high? The

524
00:27:28.130 --> 00:27:30.710
most common thing on a
public website is not having

525
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:35.120
a <inaudible> or a compact
privacy policy set up because

526
00:27:35.510 --> 00:27:38.510
I will often toss cookies
that it finds a be

527
00:27:38.510 --> 00:27:41.510
a little suspect, especially if
your site does not have

528
00:27:41.510 --> 00:27:45.950
an actual express privacy policy.
I thought his cookie was

529
00:27:45.950 --> 00:27:48.950
being kicked back by privacy
policy, but it turned out

530
00:27:49.220 --> 00:27:52.640
that there was a security
update pushed out to IIE

531
00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:57.260
recently. And actually Jeff Berkowitz
on my blog called that

532
00:27:57.260 --> 00:28:00.080
out. And then John talked
to Microsoft support and we

533
00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.710
think that it's been confirmed.
It's actually a Microsoft KB

534
00:28:03.710 --> 00:28:06.890
article three one two four
six one that says that

535
00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.740
when you have a DNS
name or a server name

536
00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:13.100
that has an underscore in
it, that's a risk. And

537
00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.040
so I will actually kick
that back silently. I was

538
00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:18.770
refusing the cookie because his
server name had an underscore.

539
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:21.740
That's really wild. It was
totally wild. And when we

540
00:28:21.740 --> 00:28:23.900
threw it out, a bunch
of guys said, Oh, I

541
00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.300
totally had that happen to
me. And this is one

542
00:28:26.300 --> 00:28:27.650
of those bugs where you
just have to say it

543
00:28:27.650 --> 00:28:29.990
out loud once. And once
you've heard it, it'll never

544
00:28:29.990 --> 00:28:33.080
happen to you, but it
had never hit John before.

545
00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:35.780
I hadn't seen it before.
Now I know not to

546
00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:38.870
put underscores in my, in
my domain names. It turns

547
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:42.440
out that having an underscoring,
your DNA domain name, and

548
00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:44.150
again, this was an internal
domain. I think it was

549
00:28:44.150 --> 00:28:48.290
like my underscore server that
was being sent back. It's

550
00:28:48.290 --> 00:28:50.750
just not cool. So don't
do it. It's not RFC

551
00:28:50.750 --> 00:28:53.870
compliant. And the big bug,
of course, a Rocky LACA

552
00:28:53.870 --> 00:28:56.750
brought to our attention. But
apparently it's been kicked around

553
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:01.190
a little bit about how
an ASP net threads can

554
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:04.610
switch on you in, in
the back end and ASP

555
00:29:04.610 --> 00:29:10.100
net unexpectedly, thus rendering the
security context and everything else

556
00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:13.070
sort of moot, right? A
lot of that all about,

557
00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.230
Yeah, it's a pretty crazy
bug. A lot of people

558
00:29:15.230 --> 00:29:18.080
have, have felt that once
a request comes in to

559
00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:22.330
asp.net, that I can count
on my underlying thread to

560
00:29:22.340 --> 00:29:24.920
be my underlying thread and
to not change. And it

561
00:29:24.920 --> 00:29:26.660
really comes down to kind
of that definition of what

562
00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:33.680
is unexpectedly, right? asp.net job
is to manage this pool

563
00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.770
of worker threads and its
whole goal is to avoid

564
00:29:37.130 --> 00:29:40.610
any kind of blocking. Anytime
a thread is blocked, that's

565
00:29:40.610 --> 00:29:42.580
a thread that could be
doing something else. So it

566
00:29:42.580 --> 00:29:45.370
does everything that it can
to prevent that. And this

567
00:29:45.370 --> 00:29:48.700
actually hearkened back to some,
some older, older stuff that

568
00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.330
I had posted about the
thread static attribute. This is

569
00:29:52.340 --> 00:29:55.630
an attribute that you can
put onto a, a variable

570
00:29:55.630 --> 00:29:58.780
that says you're like a
static, except every thread has

571
00:29:58.780 --> 00:30:01.450
a copy of you. And
what can happen is if

572
00:30:01.450 --> 00:30:05.110
your request is switched out
and some other request comes

573
00:30:05.110 --> 00:30:07.750
in and uses your thread
in the pool there, that

574
00:30:07.750 --> 00:30:10.210
information that you've decided to
store in that thread static

575
00:30:10.210 --> 00:30:12.160
attribute is going to be
opened up to them. So

576
00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.220
I just said in a
very short blog post don't

577
00:30:15.220 --> 00:30:19.270
use a thread static attribute
with asp.net and an Australian

578
00:30:19.300 --> 00:30:22.630
named peers. Seven referenced that
older post and really went

579
00:30:22.810 --> 00:30:25.690
to the next level, did
a lot of very good

580
00:30:25.690 --> 00:30:29.470
experimentation and we'll post a
link to his post. And

581
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.050
Rocky discovered this because you
know, Rocky is all about

582
00:30:32.050 --> 00:30:34.840
the business objects. He wrote
the book on business objects

583
00:30:34.840 --> 00:30:37.120
and he said, well, I
need to count on my

584
00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:41.770
thread level data. As I
pass things from asp.net into

585
00:30:41.800 --> 00:30:44.260
my business objects. And most
importantly, he was concerned about

586
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.080
the current principal of the
thread, right? Who am I,

587
00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.780
my security information that was
causing a lot of problems.

588
00:30:50.140 --> 00:30:52.900
And the issue is that
some people say requests were

589
00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:56.440
thread agile, meaning that things
could get swapped out at

590
00:30:56.440 --> 00:31:00.190
any time and that's wrong.
Other people say requests, they're

591
00:31:00.190 --> 00:31:03.550
pinned to a thread for
the lifetime and that's wrong.

592
00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.130
And we actually talked about
this a number of different

593
00:31:06.130 --> 00:31:08.410
times and we couldn't figure
it out. So we went

594
00:31:08.410 --> 00:31:11.500
to Scott Guthrie and he was
kind enough to really put

595
00:31:11.500 --> 00:31:14.520
this to rest. It was
amazing. The response, I mean,

596
00:31:14.520 --> 00:31:17.910
somebody said, Hey, Scott Guthrie should
read this. And like the

597
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.870
next day he said, I
just, just now got this

598
00:31:21.870 --> 00:31:24.630
thread. And here's what it's
all about. Right? So it

599
00:31:24.630 --> 00:31:27.240
turns out that there are
a number of things that

600
00:31:27.240 --> 00:31:31.260
are on the thread that
asp.net will move for you

601
00:31:31.260 --> 00:31:33.930
when it switches into another
thread. The idea is that

602
00:31:34.140 --> 00:31:37.920
if you're using something like
asynchronous pages with asp.net to,

603
00:31:37.920 --> 00:31:40.620
Oh yep. Perhaps you've written
an HTTP handler and you're

604
00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:43.650
using some async or more
likely you've written an HTTP

605
00:31:43.650 --> 00:31:47.550
module, even though it's true
that it's not possible to

606
00:31:47.550 --> 00:31:50.130
have your thread pulled out
from underneath you, when you

607
00:31:50.130 --> 00:31:53.790
have code actively running, it
is possible that your thread

608
00:31:53.790 --> 00:31:57.420
will change out and out
from underneath you between maybe

609
00:31:57.420 --> 00:32:00.840
the begin request and the
authenticate request. Because if you're

610
00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.450
doing something that's going to
block, then they're going to

611
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:06.450
possibly pass your threat off
somewhere else. It turns out

612
00:32:06.720 --> 00:32:11.910
that asp.net will automatically propagate
the thread dot current principle,

613
00:32:12.300 --> 00:32:17.970
the HTTP context, user property
and the culture information. This

614
00:32:17.970 --> 00:32:20.580
was the other big concern
is that your thread actually

615
00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:23.880
has the notion of culture.
You are your UI, your

616
00:32:23.880 --> 00:32:27.150
thread dot your current culture
ID and your current UI

617
00:32:27.150 --> 00:32:30.990
culture. All of that stuff
is propagated. So right. It

618
00:32:30.990 --> 00:32:33.360
turns out that the data
that you put on the

619
00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:35.790
thread though, if you're using
things like thread, local storage,

620
00:32:36.090 --> 00:32:39.830
yes will not come along.
It's not their responsibility to

621
00:32:39.830 --> 00:32:42.020
pull that stuff over. So
if you're going to be

622
00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:45.830
doing stuff in asp.net where
you want to store things

623
00:32:46.310 --> 00:32:49.100
in what you feel is
the current thread, put those

624
00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:52.730
things in HTTP context dot
items, right? It's never been

625
00:32:52.730 --> 00:32:54.860
a good idea. As far
as I know to store

626
00:32:54.860 --> 00:32:58.310
things in, in the thread
itself, especially in.net where the

627
00:32:58.310 --> 00:33:02.630
threads, aren't really a thread,
specifically an asp.net where you

628
00:33:02.630 --> 00:33:05.270
have this notion of my
execution context, but you're right.

629
00:33:05.270 --> 00:33:08.630
The underlying thread is managed
by some other thing right

630
00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:10.340
now, if you were doing
all this in a WinForms

631
00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:13.640
app or a console app,
people put stuff, thread local

632
00:33:13.640 --> 00:33:15.950
all the time. Yeah. Cause
you're in control of it.

633
00:33:16.010 --> 00:33:19.370
Most of the time, exactly.
The, the moral of the

634
00:33:19.370 --> 00:33:22.940
story is that asp.net owns
your threads in asp.net. So

635
00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:25.250
you need to treat them
with respect. And if you

636
00:33:25.250 --> 00:33:27.920
spin up your own thread,
you run some work on

637
00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:30.980
another thread, it's up to
you to transfer that data

638
00:33:30.980 --> 00:33:33.380
over that you might need.
And it is important to

639
00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:36.470
note that the threads aren't
changing, quote unquote, without warning,

640
00:33:36.800 --> 00:33:42.260
they're not actually changing while
the code is running. but@thosekindsoftransitionpointswhereasp.net

641
00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.980
has exposed a particular event,
it can be a problem.

642
00:33:46.970 --> 00:33:49.070
All right, Scott, I think
we got to call it

643
00:33:49.070 --> 00:33:52.490
a show. It's been a
good one. Yeah. I think

644
00:33:52.490 --> 00:33:54.260
it went pretty well. And
I really do want to

645
00:33:54.260 --> 00:33:58.070
say that we appreciate everyone's
feedback. This is a work

646
00:33:58.070 --> 00:34:00.320
in progress. I hope we
made your commute a little

647
00:34:00.320 --> 00:34:02.990
easier. I hope that you'll
recommend this to your friends.

648
00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:05.900
Continue to send me ideas
for tools bugs that you've

649
00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:09.410
had, that we can talk
about gadgets, life hacking, whatever

650
00:34:09.410 --> 00:34:11.810
it takes. And we'll try
to incorporate it into future

651
00:34:11.810 --> 00:34:14.660
versions of Hanselminutes. And next
week, we'll talk about my

652
00:34:14.660 --> 00:34:18.980
new Prius. You got a
Prius. I am haul dude.

653
00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:21.830
We're in hacker heaven. I
love my Prius. I'm going

654
00:34:21.830 --> 00:34:24.020
to get windows booting up
on that big LCD screen.

655
00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:26.060
You watch it. Me too.
All right, we'll talk about

656
00:34:26.060 --> 00:34:36.680
it next week on Hanselman.
Bye. Bye <inaudible>.
