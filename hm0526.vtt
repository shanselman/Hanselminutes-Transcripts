00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.070
This is Lawrence Ryan announcing show
number 526. In this episode,

10
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:03.270
Scott talks with software developer
and development manager, Louise Elliott

11
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:12.720
about punishment driven development. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

12
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:15.240
is another episode of Hansel
minutes today on the phone.

13
00:01:15.240 --> 00:01:18.270
I've got Louise Elliott. She's
a software development manager and

14
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:21.750
the finance industry works at
the Leeds building society. And

15
00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.180
you've been in the software
world for what, 25 years.

16
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.880
And you've done done it
all development manager, technical manager

17
00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:31.730
architect. Absolutely. Yeah, I love
the technical industry. It actually

18
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:35.540
took me a long time
to get into management. I

19
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:37.820
fought it for a long
time, but I love it.

20
00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:40.760
And now I'm here. Okay.
So, so as a manager

21
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.940
and someone who's got, we
have very similar backgrounds. I

22
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:46.670
worked in finance and did
credit unions. And what, what

23
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:50.420
you call building societies for
many, many years. And I

24
00:01:50.420 --> 00:01:53.960
did things like TDD and
BDD and all the different

25
00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:57.380
driven developments, but you've got
a really interesting perspective on

26
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:01.580
kind of development. And what
is that? That's punishment driven

27
00:02:01.580 --> 00:02:04.160
development. I obviously would have
loved to have called it

28
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:09.170
blame driven development, but apparently
be DDS already used. So

29
00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:12.410
punishment driven development is this
like, you know, death marches.

30
00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:16.790
And This is just what
I see everywhere in the

31
00:02:16.790 --> 00:02:21.200
industry, even with things like
Hatchell and other ways of

32
00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:25.310
working where we're supposed to
be moving on and doing

33
00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:32.630
things in a new way,
I still see punishment. I've

34
00:02:32.630 --> 00:02:36.650
got a kids and I
don't mean to necessarily equate

35
00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.650
children to developers, but you
know, we've all ran teams.

36
00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:43.490
Punishment. Doesn't always work though.
I mean, is it really

37
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:45.020
a motivator? Is it going
to get people up in

38
00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.590
the morning and send them
into work? Well, I think

39
00:02:48.590 --> 00:02:52.430
probably not actually, but yet
we see it all the

40
00:02:52.430 --> 00:02:54.740
time. You know, I think
one of the main reasons

41
00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.790
that people punish people in
the workplace is really around

42
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.440
retribution. It seems more about
it's going to make me

43
00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.130
feel better to punish them
than it is about actually

44
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:09.940
creating behavioral change. The only
thing I see it creating

45
00:03:09.940 --> 00:03:13.630
as a climate where people
are not willing to take

46
00:03:13.630 --> 00:03:17.590
risks, don't feel it's safe
to fail and that's not

47
00:03:17.590 --> 00:03:23.160
good for any organization. Is
it because where we taught

48
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:25.830
this, or when are we
going to learn that, that,

49
00:03:25.870 --> 00:03:29.220
that, you know, punitive type
behaviors are not our de

50
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:33.750
motivators? I don't know that
most of the time people

51
00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:39.210
care that is de-motivating other
people. I think say it's

52
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:44.490
about making them feel superior
happier at the time it's

53
00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:49.770
about them. So, you know,
something goes wrong in life

54
00:03:50.370 --> 00:03:53.730
and your manager immediately asks
who's to blame for that.

55
00:03:54.570 --> 00:03:57.840
It's about finding who is
it that we can say

56
00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:00.990
is to blame that we
can punish. And then we

57
00:04:00.990 --> 00:04:03.180
can forget about it and
move on rather than trying

58
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:09.720
to actually understand the systematic
issues and solve those behavior

59
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:12.840
changes. So the system changes
in order to make sure

60
00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:17.670
this doesn't happen again. It's
kind of lazy management style,

61
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:21.420
But at the same time,
I know that I have

62
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:25.710
been, I wouldn't say accused
of, but I have been

63
00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:29.700
at fault when I've said,
I want accountability and I've

64
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:33.660
used the word accountability, maybe
as a euphemism for blaming,

65
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:36.450
like, I don't necessarily want
to hurt someone, but someone

66
00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.820
needs to be accountable for
this, this mistake or this

67
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:42.030
thing that has, you know,
caused our projects, such, such,

68
00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:45.690
such pain. Am I wrong
to want that? What do

69
00:04:45.690 --> 00:04:48.220
you want out of that?
What are you getting from?

70
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:52.410
What do I want out
of that? I want it

71
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:55.080
to never happen again. I
want you, no one wants

72
00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:58.560
competence. So sometimes people use
punishment and accountability as a

73
00:04:58.560 --> 00:05:03.420
way of encouraging competence. So,
okay. So if they made

74
00:05:03.510 --> 00:05:06.990
a mistake, if it was
truly a mistake and then

75
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.000
not somebody makes mistakes, then
punishing, it will make absolutely

76
00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:15.450
no difference because they didn't
choose to do it was

77
00:05:15.720 --> 00:05:19.500
only interim state. And at
some point in future, they

78
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:22.140
may make that mistake again.
And there's nothing that they

79
00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.750
call a different States, but
there's nothing that they can

80
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:32.550
do to choose if there's
a behavioral issue here and

81
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:35.010
maybe they're not taking enough
care in the scenario and

82
00:05:35.010 --> 00:05:40.140
they're consistently not taking them
while again, just saying you're

83
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.720
accountable for, does that actually
get you where you want

84
00:05:44.730 --> 00:05:48.060
to be, or actually sitting
with them and discussing what

85
00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:52.380
behavior you really want from
them and what you see,

86
00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.560
how it's different from what
you'd like it to be

87
00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:58.850
in discussing with them, why
that, and working with them

88
00:05:58.850 --> 00:06:05.760
on changing that will actually
get you just saying you're

89
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:11.200
accountable and I'm going to
make it. Hmm. Now when

90
00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:13.900
you say that and I
forgive me, I am, unfortunately

91
00:06:13.900 --> 00:06:15.970
I'm putting all of this
into the context of my,

92
00:06:16.030 --> 00:06:20.650
my young children, because you've
just described a parenting style

93
00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:24.010
or a management style that
has the luxury of time.

94
00:06:24.790 --> 00:06:27.160
And I've had conversations with
my wife before where I've

95
00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.810
said, you know, Hey, we
really ought to sit down

96
00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:30.820
with the eight year old
and have a conversation about

97
00:06:30.820 --> 00:06:33.970
our expectations. And she'll say,
I don't have time for

98
00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:36.580
that today. What I need
from you now is compliance.

99
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:40.810
Meaning the child, like stop
taking food onto the couch.

100
00:06:40.990 --> 00:06:43.720
You always spill the food.
Now. Yes. If I had

101
00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.460
a half an hour, I'd
sit down or an hour

102
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:47.560
and have a whole conversation
about here's how it makes

103
00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:49.990
me feel. But when you're
on a project and you

104
00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:52.810
really need to get that
project shipping, you can't, you

105
00:06:52.810 --> 00:06:55.510
can't baby, for lack of
a better word, you can't

106
00:06:55.510 --> 00:06:58.270
baby anybody. So how do
you find that balance? Well,

107
00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.910
I'm not saying that you
never have to be directive

108
00:07:00.910 --> 00:07:04.210
in your management style. That
doesn't mean that doesn't mean

109
00:07:04.210 --> 00:07:08.800
that you need to punish
it's sometimes when things were

110
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.020
agenda, you may be very
specific about exactly what you

111
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:15.700
need and who you need
it from. That's not punishment,

112
00:07:18.430 --> 00:07:21.400
but if you actually want
to change that behavior in

113
00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:25.120
the longer term, if you're
actually not facing an immediate

114
00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:31.360
emergency. So from a child,
if I have my niece

115
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:36.340
once run away from my
mom, when we were taking

116
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:38.500
her out, she was very
young and we got full

117
00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.400
and she ran away and
we couldn't find her. And

118
00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:45.940
when we did find her,
my mom's smacked her legs

119
00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.770
immediately without even thinking. And
then got very worried that

120
00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:55.660
my sister was gonna find
out, but my niece needed

121
00:07:56.890 --> 00:08:00.130
that. That was a dangerous
thing that I needed to

122
00:08:00.130 --> 00:08:03.370
remember not to do that.
And that, that age, that's

123
00:08:03.370 --> 00:08:06.100
quite a hard thing to
sit and explain and discuss.

124
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:11.650
Whereas she remembered that her
very upset with her for

125
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:15.010
doing that. And that that
was an accident. So I'm

126
00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:18.130
not saying that punishment never
has a role. And certainly

127
00:08:18.130 --> 00:08:22.150
in the upbringing of children,
there's a whole nother thing.

128
00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:25.240
I'm not a parent. I'm
not even gonna go there,

129
00:08:25.870 --> 00:08:30.370
but Parallels of course, running
a team, running a team,

130
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:33.670
running a family are very
similar, But these people are

131
00:08:33.670 --> 00:08:40.660
not children. These people's brains,
fully grown adults. And I

132
00:08:40.660 --> 00:08:42.970
think that's one of the
huge issues that we face

133
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:46.510
in a lot of industry.
When people assume that they

134
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:51.640
need to treat children, this
is all about respect. This

135
00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:55.440
is all about starting your
assumption that this person trying

136
00:08:55.440 --> 00:09:04.230
to do the best job.
Absolutely. You know, they, this

137
00:09:04.230 --> 00:09:07.560
person is not deliberately causing
you problems. And if they

138
00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.560
are, then that conversation really
does need to happen. One

139
00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:15.870
of the things that managers
I think are really bad

140
00:09:15.870 --> 00:09:25.470
at is there are two
things. One is obviously an

141
00:09:25.470 --> 00:09:29.580
incredibly unpleasant experience. I'm very
lucky. My career I've only

142
00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.950
had to do it once.
The other is the, is

143
00:09:34.950 --> 00:09:40.320
having to manage. It's a
really hard thing to do

144
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:49.830
without blame, because blame, isn't
helpful in understanding why coming

145
00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.990
up with an agreement with
the person, how that's going

146
00:09:51.990 --> 00:09:55.500
to be handled, working with
them to do. Ideally you

147
00:09:55.500 --> 00:09:59.340
get into a place where
that's been addressed. It's actually,

148
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:02.070
it takes time and it
is hard. But as a

149
00:10:02.070 --> 00:10:06.000
manager, that's your job. Your
job is not to go

150
00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.220
and sit in meetings all
the time, which is what

151
00:10:08.220 --> 00:10:13.380
my diary seems to be.
It's actually to enable the

152
00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.420
team to do the job
that they're there to do.

153
00:10:16.650 --> 00:10:20.160
And if that means understanding,
what's stopping them, irrespective of

154
00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:23.340
whether that's a technical thing,
that's stopping them a lack

155
00:10:23.340 --> 00:10:27.150
of a resource somewhere, or
whether it's actually the fact

156
00:10:27.150 --> 00:10:29.280
that they don't understand what
it is that you need

157
00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.900
from them. A lot of
managers get really frustrated and

158
00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:36.150
say, well, it's obvious they
should have escalate to me.

159
00:10:37.080 --> 00:10:39.630
But if you've never sat
down with that person and

160
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:42.720
said, these are the circumstances
I need you to escalate

161
00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:45.960
to me. When you sit
in the fact that they're

162
00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:49.350
not doing, and just assume
that they can read your

163
00:10:49.350 --> 00:10:55.850
mind and know what you
think This is really useful.

164
00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.890
This is really useful. Let
me ask you about two

165
00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:01.250
specific scenarios that I've experienced.
And you tell me if

166
00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:04.040
I was punishing or if
the person was punishing or

167
00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:06.770
not. Because I think that
these are very common scenarios.

168
00:11:06.800 --> 00:11:09.380
Now there is a product
that you can buy and

169
00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:11.750
you can, you've seen this
a lot around continuous integration,

170
00:11:12.230 --> 00:11:14.750
which is the light that
flashes when the build is

171
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.100
broken, I've heard it called
the siren of shame. You

172
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.260
know, it's the, you know,
it's the big kind of

173
00:11:21.260 --> 00:11:24.080
like either a traffic robot
or a big siren that

174
00:11:24.080 --> 00:11:27.650
goes and fires off. And
it makes noise. If so-and-so,

175
00:11:28.610 --> 00:11:30.950
you know, broke the build
and I've seen people have

176
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.700
lots of fun online with,
you know, hacking these things.

177
00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.900
So it'll actually talk, right?
The Lee's broke the build.

178
00:11:40.820 --> 00:11:45.170
Now I think that there
could be theoretically, a healthy

179
00:11:45.170 --> 00:11:47.570
culture that would be, would
have fun with that. And

180
00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:51.230
no one would feel particularly
shamed, but at the same

181
00:11:51.230 --> 00:11:53.410
time, you don't really know,
right? You could a team

182
00:11:53.410 --> 00:11:55.930
of 10 and two of
them really take that personally

183
00:11:55.930 --> 00:11:58.150
and feel like this is
an unhealthy culture where the

184
00:11:58.150 --> 00:12:02.530
other eight have quite a
light philosophy. Is that fun

185
00:12:02.710 --> 00:12:06.480
company culture or is that
punishment and shaming? I think

186
00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:09.720
it's punishment and shaming. If
people in the team feel

187
00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:14.340
that way, but if the
whole team find it fun,

188
00:12:14.910 --> 00:12:18.330
then it's a really good
path culture. The team's not

189
00:12:18.330 --> 00:12:19.800
going to split the one
or two people who don't

190
00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:21.630
like it feel comfortable enough
to say this is not

191
00:12:21.630 --> 00:12:25.230
okay. But if you're a
good manager or good reader

192
00:12:25.230 --> 00:12:29.340
of people, you shouldn't be
able to tell that people

193
00:12:29.340 --> 00:12:33.660
are not happy with that.
You know, this isn't about

194
00:12:33.660 --> 00:12:35.490
what people are willing to
tell you. And if they

195
00:12:35.490 --> 00:12:38.250
don't come to you and
say it, then it doesn't

196
00:12:38.250 --> 00:12:41.760
matter in the same way
that if you're in a

197
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.800
meeting with the team and
you've got some quiet and

198
00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:47.040
then you behave differently with
them to try and get

199
00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.270
them to contribute where other
members of the team, you

200
00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:53.040
probably don't need to do
anything at all to get

201
00:12:53.040 --> 00:12:58.230
them to contribute. You just
use different techniques. I view

202
00:12:58.230 --> 00:13:01.650
a really important role of
somebody who is leading a

203
00:13:01.650 --> 00:13:06.330
team to be know the
people, know the individuals, understand

204
00:13:06.330 --> 00:13:10.560
what they want to meet.
It's not about how you

205
00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:13.770
want to lead the team,
but actually how those individuals,

206
00:13:13.770 --> 00:13:20.100
what do they need from
you? So my second example,

207
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:24.090
my second question is when,
what I ended up instituting,

208
00:13:24.090 --> 00:13:30.270
when people broke, the build
was a pretty straightforward consequent

209
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:33.990
consequence, driven development, right? Natural
consequences, we call it, which

210
00:13:33.990 --> 00:13:35.940
is you broke the build.
You fixed the build. If

211
00:13:35.940 --> 00:13:38.790
you're able to, we used
to have scenarios where I

212
00:13:38.790 --> 00:13:41.820
remember one particular scenario where
a gentlemen broke the build,

213
00:13:42.390 --> 00:13:45.120
didn't know it went home,
you know, three o'clock on

214
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:48.810
a Friday afternoon. And I
called the person and I

215
00:13:48.810 --> 00:13:51.270
said, I'm sorry, you need
to turn around. And you

216
00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:53.400
need to fix this built
breaking the bill on Friday

217
00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:56.340
nights is not okay. Some
people felt that was a

218
00:13:56.340 --> 00:14:00.270
punishment. I felt that was
a very, very clear natural

219
00:14:00.270 --> 00:14:03.780
consequence because it would block
everyone from working all weekend.

220
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.850
I think as long as
people know and have agreed

221
00:14:08.850 --> 00:14:14.880
in the team, the engagement
with the team, so people

222
00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.360
understand the consequences of breaking
means that they need to

223
00:14:18.360 --> 00:14:22.890
fix that. And also that
the team is enough of

224
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:26.130
a team that they don't
want the rest of the

225
00:14:26.130 --> 00:14:29.370
team not to go to
work on the weekend, but

226
00:14:29.370 --> 00:14:32.340
actually they take this as
a responsibility that they have,

227
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:36.570
and that's not punishment, but
it is important that it

228
00:14:36.570 --> 00:14:40.020
is agreed and understood within
the team rather than it

229
00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:45.330
just suddenly appearing. I see.
So the difference in all

230
00:14:45.330 --> 00:14:51.150
of these scenarios that I've
described is expectations and understanding.

231
00:14:52.610 --> 00:15:00.020
Absolutely. And also as far
as possible, setting that way

232
00:15:00.020 --> 00:15:03.650
of working, setting their own
rules for engagement within the

233
00:15:03.650 --> 00:15:09.100
team, rather than it being
imposed by the manager, Right?

234
00:15:09.130 --> 00:15:12.040
Bringing it down on high,
makes it feel even more

235
00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:17.380
like punishment. Absolutely. Rather than
actually being about this is

236
00:15:17.380 --> 00:15:22.480
our commitment to each of
those team members. This episode

237
00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:24.610
of Hansel minutes is brought
to you by brain tree

238
00:15:24.610 --> 00:15:27.610
payments. By next year, maybe
even next week, there could

239
00:15:27.610 --> 00:15:29.290
be a whole new way
to pay. Maybe it will

240
00:15:29.290 --> 00:15:31.510
be the next Bitcoin or
the next Apple pay. Maybe

241
00:15:31.510 --> 00:15:35.560
even both fortunately brain tree's
full stack payment platform is

242
00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.110
easily adaptable to whatever the
future holds. So you can

243
00:15:38.110 --> 00:15:41.560
adapt easily to, you can
accept everything from pounds to

244
00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:44.440
PayPal, to that next big
innovation from any device with

245
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:47.740
one integration. And when that
new payment method comes out,

246
00:15:47.980 --> 00:15:49.480
all you have to do
is update a few lines

247
00:15:49.480 --> 00:15:53.680
of code no late nights,
no complicated recoding, no stress

248
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:56.080
about staying ahead of the
curve. Braintree payments is here

249
00:15:56.080 --> 00:16:02.710
to help. You can learn
more@braintreepayments.com slash Hanselman that's Braintree

250
00:16:02.710 --> 00:16:10.030
payments.com/hanselman. SDK is available in
lots of languages, including.net, node,

251
00:16:10.330 --> 00:16:15.640
Java, Perl, and Python, Ruby,
check it out. So backing

252
00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:17.350
up a little bit and
taking this in a different

253
00:16:17.350 --> 00:16:20.530
direction. You had said that
when punishment is being the

254
00:16:20.530 --> 00:16:23.530
primary motivator within development, it's
really not about the punished

255
00:16:24.070 --> 00:16:26.440
it's about the Punisher and
what that's doing to them

256
00:16:26.440 --> 00:16:29.170
is it, is it changing
their brain? There are the

257
00:16:29.170 --> 00:16:31.600
two people who are more
likely to drive development teams

258
00:16:31.630 --> 00:16:35.890
like this. Yeah, there was
a study last year that

259
00:16:35.890 --> 00:16:39.910
came out that actually looked
at how, whether different people

260
00:16:39.910 --> 00:16:44.140
have more propensity to punish
than other people did. Well,

261
00:16:44.140 --> 00:16:49.330
they actually found was that
if they quieten down certain

262
00:16:49.330 --> 00:16:53.980
areas of the prefrontal cortex,
people wanted to punish less

263
00:16:54.490 --> 00:16:58.390
than when that area was
more active. And this was

264
00:16:58.390 --> 00:17:02.410
a really interesting study. They
asked the question, should we

265
00:17:02.410 --> 00:17:08.050
actually task, make judging, punish
for a living such as

266
00:17:08.050 --> 00:17:16.240
judges and decided to see
how suitable they are to

267
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.320
be a judge in our
society. But I would actually

268
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:24.520
take that into any kind
of area where people are

269
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:28.840
able, I guess, and have
a forum for other people

270
00:17:29.230 --> 00:17:33.280
and could choose to punish
in the workplace and say,

271
00:17:33.550 --> 00:17:36.790
is that person doing that?
Because they have very high

272
00:17:36.790 --> 00:17:40.030
activity in that area of
their brain. Are they suitable

273
00:17:40.030 --> 00:17:42.250
for that kind of work
and that kind of job?

274
00:17:42.940 --> 00:17:45.610
What kind of impact are
they going to have on

275
00:17:45.610 --> 00:17:52.050
everybody else in the organization?
Whenever I hear like suitable,

276
00:17:53.010 --> 00:17:54.360
then I feel like, you
know, who am I to

277
00:17:54.360 --> 00:17:57.090
judge? You know, like who
judges the judges? You know,

278
00:17:58.110 --> 00:18:00.870
there could be biological reasons.
There are like that. That

279
00:18:00.870 --> 00:18:02.790
could be historical reasons. There
could be all sorts of

280
00:18:02.790 --> 00:18:05.490
reasons why someone's like that.
It gets into all the

281
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:08.460
dishes around company culture and
who fits and who doesn't.

282
00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:13.640
And it's such a slippery
slope. Yeah, true. You know,

283
00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:16.820
the company called try working
right now is actually quite

284
00:18:16.820 --> 00:18:23.450
hierarchical, but we are very
deliberately trying to engender change

285
00:18:23.450 --> 00:18:28.580
in that culture. And so
is there some punishment around,

286
00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.910
in my culture right now?
Yes. Do we get some

287
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:35.450
questions around who's to blame
when things go wrong? Yes

288
00:18:35.450 --> 00:18:40.640
we do. But going back
in actually questioning blame at

289
00:18:40.640 --> 00:18:44.210
the point that it's starting
to be talked about has

290
00:18:44.210 --> 00:18:46.370
a really good impact. And
actually people go, Oh yeah,

291
00:18:46.370 --> 00:18:48.200
you're right. When you touch,
you look at what's going

292
00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.110
wrong and why it's gone
wrong and stopping that happening

293
00:18:51.110 --> 00:18:54.170
again, rather than actually trying
to find the person to

294
00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:59.990
play. And corporate cultures can
be changed. It's hard and

295
00:18:59.990 --> 00:19:03.200
it takes a long time,
but it can happen with

296
00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:08.480
the right support. But if
you have somebody whose brain

297
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:10.790
is just super active in
Sarah and they just want

298
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:12.680
to punish, and they get
a lot of pleasure from

299
00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:16.880
doing that, then I would
argue, they're probably just not

300
00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.060
suitable for that type of
job. And hopefully we discover

301
00:19:20.070 --> 00:19:24.950
this before it's too late.
Well ideally, or maybe we

302
00:19:24.950 --> 00:19:28.610
can give them one of
these electromagnetic coils around the

303
00:19:28.610 --> 00:19:31.580
head that dampens down the
area of that, right? Like

304
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.340
we have a special hat
And this is not a

305
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:37.190
joke. This is a really
a thing. This is absolutely

306
00:19:37.190 --> 00:19:39.650
a study that came out
last year that found this

307
00:19:39.650 --> 00:19:42.140
to be the case. I'm
trying to think of there's

308
00:19:42.140 --> 00:19:44.420
people in our lives or
in our governments that perhaps

309
00:19:44.420 --> 00:19:48.260
may need some of these
things. Most of the time.

310
00:19:48.260 --> 00:19:52.190
I think it's learned behavior.
When you have a manager

311
00:19:52.190 --> 00:19:56.030
who's only ever worked in
a hierarchical organization, who's had

312
00:19:56.030 --> 00:20:00.290
a boss who's maybe very
bullying, but only management style

313
00:20:00.290 --> 00:20:03.980
data ever scene. So it's
very likely to be the

314
00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.260
way that they deal with
people, even if that's not

315
00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:10.400
their natural way of being.
I think most of the

316
00:20:10.400 --> 00:20:15.440
time just talking sense and
explaining and showing more powerfully

317
00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:19.190
than anything else that changes
in behavior, which can be

318
00:20:19.190 --> 00:20:23.390
achieved when what you're doing
is working with people and

319
00:20:23.390 --> 00:20:30.050
not demanding. Of course, you
lost me at talking sense

320
00:20:30.050 --> 00:20:33.140
into the managers, but I
was with you up until

321
00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.140
then. So let's think a
little bit more about this

322
00:20:36.140 --> 00:20:37.790
so that there are people's
brains might be different. They

323
00:20:37.790 --> 00:20:39.500
may be, they may have
things that caused them to

324
00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:41.690
want to punish, but you,
you had a number of

325
00:20:41.690 --> 00:20:44.690
reasons. You had an enumeration
of reasons why one might

326
00:20:44.690 --> 00:20:49.090
punish. So yeah, that there
are reasons why people might

327
00:20:49.090 --> 00:20:52.150
want to punish other people.
So one of them is

328
00:20:52.150 --> 00:20:56.020
to stop that person doing
the same thing again. So

329
00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.900
if that's your reason for
punishing, then it has to

330
00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:02.290
be that it was their
choice to do it so

331
00:21:02.290 --> 00:21:05.830
that you are stopping them
from doing that again. So

332
00:21:05.830 --> 00:21:12.330
something like a mistake. So
a malicious, some, some specific

333
00:21:12.330 --> 00:21:15.150
thing that they did to
sabotage, Or maybe they did

334
00:21:15.150 --> 00:21:18.780
something, not knowing that it
wasn't acceptable and then you

335
00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:21.540
punish them. And now they
know it's not acceptable. Won't

336
00:21:21.540 --> 00:21:24.360
do it again. Or maybe
they were just pushing at

337
00:21:24.360 --> 00:21:28.770
the edges. The next reason
is to stop other people

338
00:21:28.980 --> 00:21:38.490
from doing so if you
punish somebody very, so let's

339
00:21:38.490 --> 00:21:41.970
say they make a mistake.
It's in life. They get

340
00:21:41.970 --> 00:21:47.430
their salary dog. Everybody else
knows that's happened. Then they

341
00:21:47.430 --> 00:21:49.820
won't do that. No one
else is gonna do that

342
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:53.760
again. That seems that people
are choosing to do that

343
00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:58.950
thing. And that it isn't
just a mistake. The third

344
00:21:58.950 --> 00:22:03.570
one is just for retribution
because it feels good person

345
00:22:03.570 --> 00:22:07.440
doing the punishing. It feels
like and deserves to be

346
00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:14.130
punished and I'm punishing. And
the final one is where

347
00:22:14.130 --> 00:22:17.640
you have something that's actually
affected an individual. You might

348
00:22:17.670 --> 00:22:20.670
punish somebody in order to
compensate victims and you might

349
00:22:20.670 --> 00:22:24.300
find somebody and give the
money to the person who

350
00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:28.440
actually had the bad effect
of whatever the activity box.

351
00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.800
I would argue that the
vast majority of the time

352
00:22:31.800 --> 00:22:34.770
in the workplace, when people
punish you, it's actually for

353
00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:38.970
reasons of retribution, because it
feels like a good thing

354
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:43.080
to do rather than to
change the behavior, to look

355
00:22:43.350 --> 00:22:48.600
why those situations happened and
how it can avoid. So

356
00:22:48.930 --> 00:22:53.370
thinking about how to avoid
having things happen. Again, I

357
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:57.000
hope that people who are
listening are thinking that they've

358
00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:59.670
either maybe worked at a
company like this before, or

359
00:22:59.670 --> 00:23:02.550
maybe, you know, God forbid
they are in a company

360
00:23:02.550 --> 00:23:05.370
like that. Right now, I
wrote about fear-driven development a

361
00:23:05.370 --> 00:23:07.440
while back. And it resonated
with a lot of people.

362
00:23:07.830 --> 00:23:10.440
I think when we, we,
we find that, wait a

363
00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:14.940
second, she's she's talking about
my organization. What do we

364
00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:17.820
do, though? If we are
downstream, how do you, if

365
00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:20.520
you're living in a fear-driven
or punishment driven environment, how

366
00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:25.260
do you, how do you
save yourself? Other than, I

367
00:23:25.290 --> 00:23:27.930
don't know that there is
an easy way to do

368
00:23:27.930 --> 00:23:30.240
that. I think maybe quitting
is the way to go

369
00:23:37.410 --> 00:23:40.590
in the organization. I mean,
the thing that makes the

370
00:23:40.650 --> 00:23:45.620
biggest difference is the fact
that the CIO is very

371
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:50.930
people oriented. So the previous
CIO mostly not, was far

372
00:23:50.930 --> 00:23:54.080
less search for the currency.
I was very people oriented

373
00:23:54.410 --> 00:23:57.830
and he wants to make
this change in culture. And

374
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:01.370
that means that anybody lowers
stream, who also wants to

375
00:24:01.370 --> 00:24:06.620
make that changing culture has
a champion and can say

376
00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:08.390
to people, I don't think
we should be doing it

377
00:24:08.390 --> 00:24:13.640
this way, because there's support
higher level. But without that

378
00:24:13.640 --> 00:24:17.510
support, higher level is an
incredibly difficult thing to do.

379
00:24:17.990 --> 00:24:20.860
Yeah. Yeah. The way that
we phrase it at my

380
00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:24.640
company is we call it
executive air cover. If you're

381
00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:27.790
going into, you know, to
a fight, do you have

382
00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:30.370
air cover at the, at
some level that is reasonably

383
00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:32.410
high, especially if it's a
policy type of a change,

384
00:24:32.410 --> 00:24:36.550
you really need a champion,
don't you? Yeah, definitely. You

385
00:24:36.550 --> 00:24:39.070
know, at the end of
the day, you have to

386
00:24:39.070 --> 00:24:42.490
look at organizations, ask, do
they fit you in who

387
00:24:42.490 --> 00:24:45.820
you are as an individual?
I'm part of that is

388
00:24:45.820 --> 00:24:48.190
how do you look to
be treated? How do you

389
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:52.300
deserve to be treated? And
do they treat you that

390
00:24:52.300 --> 00:24:54.880
way? And when they don't,
can you have a reasonable

391
00:24:54.880 --> 00:25:00.120
conversation with them about, and
do they treat other people

392
00:25:00.130 --> 00:25:04.840
that way? That matters to
me. So I have values

393
00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:12.490
around people being respected around
openness and honesty. If I'm

394
00:25:12.490 --> 00:25:14.710
in a management chain and
I'm asked to keep something

395
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:20.110
secret for anything other than
that, doesn't sound like a

396
00:25:20.110 --> 00:25:22.300
good reason. If they can't
give me a reason to

397
00:25:22.300 --> 00:25:26.710
keep it secret, then I
looked absolutely challenged because it

398
00:25:26.710 --> 00:25:31.030
goes against what I think.
And if I was working

399
00:25:31.030 --> 00:25:33.280
at an organization where that
was happening all the time,

400
00:25:33.490 --> 00:25:36.460
I would leave because my
core values would not be

401
00:25:36.820 --> 00:25:41.770
in sync. Hmm. So when
we talk about fit and

402
00:25:41.890 --> 00:25:45.370
culture fit and company fit,
it really is about values.

403
00:25:45.430 --> 00:25:47.590
More than anything like that.
Those are the reasons to

404
00:25:47.590 --> 00:25:51.190
join a company and to
quit a company. Absolutely. If

405
00:25:51.190 --> 00:25:55.700
I go for an interview
and organization, I have lots

406
00:25:55.700 --> 00:25:58.420
and lots of questions because
I want to know, is

407
00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:01.990
this an organization I want
to work? And the older

408
00:26:01.990 --> 00:26:05.320
I get, the more it
matters to me. I think

409
00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:09.310
maybe the more choice I
have about, but when I

410
00:26:09.310 --> 00:26:11.090
was younger, it was just,
yay. I've been offered a

411
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:15.100
job. Now it's very much
do I want to work?

412
00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.660
Is this somewhere where I
can make a difference where

413
00:26:20.530 --> 00:26:24.280
I'm going to feel comfortable,
where they do something that

414
00:26:24.290 --> 00:26:28.180
I care about? So the
organization I worked for right

415
00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:32.710
now is mutual. It's owned
by its customers. There aren't

416
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.850
any shareholders. And that is
really important to me. And

417
00:26:36.850 --> 00:26:42.280
it's one of the things
that makes me engaged. And

418
00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:44.340
it was one of the
I was looking for when

419
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:52.760
I left was that level
of caring. And as such,

420
00:26:52.790 --> 00:26:56.540
you, you, you, as a
manager now are not driving

421
00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.480
development through punishment. What is
your motivator for, for your

422
00:26:59.540 --> 00:27:02.750
people who work for you?
I guess it's still PDD,

423
00:27:02.750 --> 00:27:07.220
but it's people That's a
PDD week. I think we

424
00:27:07.220 --> 00:27:15.020
can, we can do it.
It's totally empowerment is totally,

425
00:27:16.610 --> 00:27:20.000
you know, this is an
organization where, when I joined

426
00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:26.900
more than 10 years, really
unusual scenario, I've not seen

427
00:27:26.900 --> 00:27:31.130
it elsewhere in my career.
And it was very inward.

428
00:27:31.600 --> 00:27:35.810
So there are a number
of things that weren't done

429
00:27:35.810 --> 00:27:39.260
that are pretty standard in
the industry now. So things

430
00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:44.540
like continuous integration, anything that
they did automate automated testing

431
00:27:45.590 --> 00:27:50.540
that they did. And we
do those things now, and

432
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:57.080
we've moved on and doing
those through people, getting engaged

433
00:27:57.080 --> 00:28:00.770
and understanding, wanting to do
those things rather than through

434
00:28:00.770 --> 00:28:04.980
dictate of you will do
these things. It's more of

435
00:28:06.380 --> 00:28:08.810
getting people excited around it.
One of the things I

436
00:28:08.810 --> 00:28:11.720
love about where I work
at the moment, it says

437
00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:16.400
some little resistance to change.
People have done something this

438
00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.010
way for so long, but
they love a better way

439
00:28:19.010 --> 00:28:22.460
of doing it. You know,
I am sitting here doing

440
00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:25.490
my job. I can make
so much difference. And that's

441
00:28:25.490 --> 00:28:29.690
because of the people who
work the culture and the

442
00:28:29.690 --> 00:28:32.390
fact that they really want
to do things as best

443
00:28:32.390 --> 00:28:36.020
as they can for the
members of the organization. And,

444
00:28:36.080 --> 00:28:41.360
you know, it's, it's such
an enabling culture. Yeah. That

445
00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:44.330
sounds like, like power driven
development in the context of

446
00:28:44.330 --> 00:28:47.480
empowerment. You like that you
can have that one for

447
00:28:47.480 --> 00:28:50.660
free. Well, thank you so
much for chatting with me

448
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.560
today. Thank you. I've thoroughly
enjoyed it, Louise Elliot. And

449
00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.590
you can find her online
and talking about punishment driven

450
00:28:57.590 --> 00:29:01.190
development. This has been another
episode of Hanselminutes and we'll

451
00:29:01.190 --> 00:29:02.300
see you again next week.
