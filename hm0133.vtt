this episode, Scott talks to
machine translation with head of

10
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:04.410
SEO Rivera. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman, and this is

11
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:06.810
another episode of Hansel minutes
and I'm sitting in building

12
00:01:06.810 --> 00:01:10.200
99, the fabled building 99
here at Microsoft campus in

13
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.880
Redmond. This is the home
of Microsoft research. This is

14
00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:15.990
an amazing building. Then I'll
have to point you to

15
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.750
pictures online. And I'm sitting
here with a test lead

16
00:01:18.750 --> 00:01:22.920
for machine translation, a healthy
SEO Rivera. I sure appreciate

17
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.180
you taking the time to
sit down and talk to

18
00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:27.660
me, not a problem. So
I added some translation stuff

19
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:29.670
on my site a while
back, and I know that

20
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:33.720
people have seen things like
Babblefish for years, but something

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:35.370
that you wrote really caught
my eye and I knew

22
00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.230
I had to come and
visit you. And it was

23
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:39.720
T bot. Is that what
we're calling? I'm calling teapot.

24
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:42.990
Yeah, that's the name T
bot or a translation bot

25
00:01:42.990 --> 00:01:45.300
for messenger. And so how
does bot work? What is

26
00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:48.390
the experience like for teapot?
T bots is an end

27
00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:52.080
point for messenger that acts
like a human, right? So

28
00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.650
for all it matters, a
messenger thinks that it's relative

29
00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:59.280
messages to a human. And
what the bot does basically

30
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:01.800
is that it sits in
the middle of a conversation

31
00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:05.130
between two humans that don't
speak the same language. So

32
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:07.830
the assumptions that someone wants
to talk to someone else

33
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.470
that doesn't speak the same
language and therefore he or

34
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:17.040
she invites T bot to
start a conversation, T bot

35
00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.160
will prompt you to select
basically what translation do you

36
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:23.190
want to perform? And once
you're done with the basic

37
00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:25.620
selection, you can then invite
someone else to join you

38
00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:29.610
in a conference. So whatever
you type is going to

39
00:02:29.610 --> 00:02:32.820
be translated from one language
to the other, and once

40
00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.760
your friend on the other
hand type something else, it's

41
00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:38.400
going to reverse the translation.
So it's pretty much acts

42
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.550
like an interpreter in the
middle of a conversation. So

43
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:43.830
there's three of us in
the conversation. There's me, the

44
00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:46.800
other person. And then teapot
that's right. If they say

45
00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:49.920
hello there that's right. Teapot
bot is going to echo

46
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:54.410
what they said or whatever.
Let's just imagine that I'm,

47
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:57.960
I'm, I'm speaking Portuguese, my
native language, and I don't

48
00:02:57.960 --> 00:03:01.180
speak English for, for whatever
reason. So in my case,

49
00:03:01.180 --> 00:03:03.430
I would invite T butts
and say, Hey, T-ball translate

50
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.280
everything from Portuguese to English.
And then I would invite

51
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:10.120
you. Right? So anything I
type would be translated from

52
00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:13.060
Portuguese to English would show
up in the literal conversation,

53
00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:16.870
Portuguese. Yes you do. Okay.
Which is also something that

54
00:03:16.870 --> 00:03:20.890
helps a lot because machine
translation by nature is not

55
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:25.420
perfect. So human beings are
able to infer when the

56
00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:29.410
translation is really bad and
understand the differences. So it's

57
00:03:29.410 --> 00:03:32.890
really important to show the
original sentence and the translated

58
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:36.420
sentence at the same time,
It's like people give machine

59
00:03:36.420 --> 00:03:40.380
translation a hard time. People
just laugh and laugh and

60
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:43.110
laugh. I've seen people have
a there's the, there's an

61
00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:46.110
old joke from a television
show called news radio. I

62
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:47.550
don't know how long you've
been in the States, but

63
00:03:47.550 --> 00:03:49.950
the show is called news
radio. I remember. So are

64
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:54.120
you familiar with super karate
monkey death car? So Jimmy

65
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:57.930
James, the owner of the
radio station wrote his biography

66
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.100
and had it translated professionally
into Japanese. And then the

67
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.700
Japanese took that translation and
had it translated back into

68
00:04:05.730 --> 00:04:10.650
English and then sold it
and it got completely twisted

69
00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:13.200
around. And one of the
chapters became called super karate

70
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.870
monkey death car. And there's
no idea where that came

71
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.460
from or how it happened,
but that's just one of

72
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:20.550
those things that happens in
people really enjoy translating things

73
00:04:20.550 --> 00:04:23.850
back and forth. I think
that the naysayers might say,

74
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:28.130
you know, why bother? We're
just talking pigeon English at

75
00:04:28.140 --> 00:04:30.780
the end, ultimately anyway. Yeah.
I, it's not that bad.

76
00:04:31.110 --> 00:04:35.070
I can definitely tell you
that, you know, it's used

77
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.650
to be really, really bad.
And, and now the new

78
00:04:38.190 --> 00:04:43.890
research on statistical translation definitely
have improved the quality of,

79
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:46.560
of, of what you get.
Now, there are a couple

80
00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:49.140
of different things that you
have to consider when taking,

81
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:52.650
you know, when, when talking
about either a chat or

82
00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.790
I am conversation, first of
all, there's always retries. So

83
00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:01.050
people can actually try again
if the translated sentence makes

84
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:03.990
no sense. And another thing
that we have to keep

85
00:05:03.990 --> 00:05:06.210
in mind is that once
you have access to both

86
00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.390
the original and the translated,
most of the times you

87
00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:11.760
can infer what the person
was trying to say. Of

88
00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:15.330
course, in my case, I
speak no Japanese. So looking

89
00:05:15.330 --> 00:05:19.050
at the original sentence in
Japanese would make me no

90
00:05:19.050 --> 00:05:21.660
good at all. But at
the same time, there is

91
00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.530
a possibility that I can
ask again, I didn't understand.

92
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:27.750
Could you please read Pete
and not just repeat, but

93
00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:31.020
rephrase Exactly. And people do
that. So one of the

94
00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:33.570
things that I learned in
the very beginning of the

95
00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:36.990
project, while it was still
a prototype, was that people

96
00:05:37.020 --> 00:05:41.040
change the way they type
in others to get better

97
00:05:41.040 --> 00:05:43.920
translations. Yeah, it's funny. I
thought that I was kind

98
00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:46.050
of the only one that
did that because I speak

99
00:05:46.050 --> 00:05:48.720
a couple of languages and
I know, I feel like

100
00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.790
I'm gaming the system. Exactly,
Exactly. That's exactly it. So

101
00:05:54.090 --> 00:05:58.700
you start using less slangs.
You try to form sentences

102
00:05:58.700 --> 00:06:01.610
differently in order to get
the best translation because your

103
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:04.880
goal is actually to communicate,
right. It's not, you know,

104
00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:08.960
to get perfect translation it's
to send your message across.

105
00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:13.070
So you end up adapting
to whatever restriction you have.

106
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.470
So that's specific to either
multilanguage chat rooms or, or

107
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:23.030
I am conversations right now
with respect to documents. Well,

108
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:28.730
again, I think that the
Microsoft technology is such that,

109
00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:33.530
yeah, it's not perfect. And
most definitely we need to

110
00:06:33.530 --> 00:06:37.160
improve a lot in several
different aspects. But the fact

111
00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.490
that we have something called
the bilingual viewer for document

112
00:06:40.490 --> 00:06:45.110
translation is really, really effective.
So the bilingual viewer interface

113
00:06:45.530 --> 00:06:49.670
is something that presents you
with basically two frames, right?

114
00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:52.310
One with the source document,
the other one with the

115
00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:56.510
target document in translated in
whatever language you select and

116
00:06:56.540 --> 00:07:01.220
allows you to a select
sentences in both frames at

117
00:07:01.220 --> 00:07:04.730
the same time. So there's
highlighting that allows you to

118
00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:09.110
actually position the cursor and
read source and target, and

119
00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:14.150
you have a synchronized trolling.
So you always have your

120
00:07:14.150 --> 00:07:17.930
original page for your reference
and the translated page for

121
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:20.680
reading. Now, that seems like
that would make sense for

122
00:07:20.680 --> 00:07:24.310
people who speak a little
bit of either language. I

123
00:07:24.310 --> 00:07:27.160
mean, everyone speaks a little
bit of English, right? And

124
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:28.630
everyone speaks a little bit
of Spanish. I don't know

125
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:31.810
That that's true, but also
helps with a couple of

126
00:07:31.810 --> 00:07:35.140
very common mistakes that most
of the machine translation systems

127
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:40.290
make like translating addresses. For
example, that can throw you

128
00:07:40.330 --> 00:07:43.240
completely It'll will build a
whole sentence around on address,

129
00:07:43.270 --> 00:07:47.830
right? Or, you know, whenever
it gets the name wrong,

130
00:07:48.070 --> 00:07:51.790
it tries to translate to
someone name, for example. So

131
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:55.600
those mistakes are very common
and it's not just particular

132
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.350
to our system. Most of
you know, the, the translation

133
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:02.140
systems around the are based
on the same, you know,

134
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:07.060
principals. So they do try
to sometimes translate stuff that

135
00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.060
by, by default should not
be translated. So in those

136
00:08:10.060 --> 00:08:13.420
cases have the access to
the source and the target

137
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.810
frames is like essential to
figure out that you should

138
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.190
not bother basically veterans day.
Now you mentioned the innovations

139
00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:24.460
if I understand correctly, statistical
yes. Can you talk a

140
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.190
little bit more about that?
Just a little bit, because

141
00:08:27.190 --> 00:08:30.100
it's not my area of
expertise, but basically you can

142
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:35.710
think about this new generation
of systems as something that

143
00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:40.180
consumes a bunch of text,
right. Written in, in more

144
00:08:40.180 --> 00:08:44.170
than one language, we call
those parallel texts. So basically

145
00:08:44.170 --> 00:08:46.750
you have a document in
English and a document. We

146
00:08:46.750 --> 00:08:50.140
have the equivalent translation in
Portuguese, you feed the system

147
00:08:50.140 --> 00:08:54.100
with several millions of sentences
like that parallel data, right.

148
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:57.780
And the system, how to
translate from one language to

149
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:02.190
the other. So the quality
of your result directly the

150
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:04.950
pans on the amount of
parallel data you submit to

151
00:09:04.950 --> 00:09:07.770
the system. Now, if you
go back in time, like

152
00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.200
I would say five years
ago, the systems were a

153
00:09:13.200 --> 00:09:16.320
little different. You would actually
try to build a grammar

154
00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:22.020
describing how, you know, the
language was put yes, language

155
00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:24.960
wasn't met together. Yes we
did. And now we are

156
00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:28.050
trying to teach the systems
how to actually learn by

157
00:09:28.050 --> 00:09:30.600
themselves. So I think that,
you know, it, it will

158
00:09:30.600 --> 00:09:33.870
drastically improve the overall quality
of, of, of the results

159
00:09:33.870 --> 00:09:37.100
as we move forward. Interesting.
It seems like the data

160
00:09:37.100 --> 00:09:41.000
that humans create is not
pretty. And when someone tries

161
00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.370
to create a grammar or
an equation or some kind

162
00:09:43.370 --> 00:09:46.640
of thing, ultimately it comes
down to a well, you

163
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:49.760
know, it's like capture, right,
exactly. This is the equivalent,

164
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:51.860
you know, right. To humans
did a lot of work

165
00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:54.590
and we'll let the computer
figure it out, warts, warts,

166
00:09:54.590 --> 00:09:57.470
and all, as we say,
right. Which would be something

167
00:09:57.470 --> 00:09:59.540
I would never feed into
a translator. There you go.

168
00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:03.200
Because it wouldn't just, Yeah.
Yeah. That's, that's actually another

169
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.830
good point because I mean,
one of the problems that

170
00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:11.780
we are, well, at least
trying to solve, not with

171
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:15.500
the current generation of system,
but, but thinking ahead is

172
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:22.550
the fact that contextual translation
is heavily based on, well,

173
00:10:22.730 --> 00:10:26.540
your context, right? So if
by any chance you're translating

174
00:10:26.540 --> 00:10:29.120
in document that has a
bunch of insurance, you know,

175
00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.180
lingual on it. Well, guess
what, if you applied the

176
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.500
wrong contextual information, you're going
to get a bunch of

177
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:41.870
nonsense, right. But at the
same time, it's, it's vaguely

178
00:10:42.170 --> 00:10:45.020
possible that we are going
to be able to build

179
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:48.650
a system so flexible that
will understand every single possible

180
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:55.100
context. So there are thoughts
around having specialized versions of

181
00:10:55.100 --> 00:10:59.060
translation engines, right? And it's
not a secret that everyone

182
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:02.480
in the industry thinks about
it. And we haven't figured

183
00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.520
out the best way to
implement it yet, but you

184
00:11:04.520 --> 00:11:06.950
know, that's, that's another thing.
That's just the nature of

185
00:11:06.950 --> 00:11:10.100
language. I, I have bad,
bad hands, so I don't

186
00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:12.830
do a lot of typing.
So I use naturally speaking

187
00:11:12.830 --> 00:11:15.380
or voice command. And I
know that like on the

188
00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:18.290
dragon naturally speaking side, they
have the medical dictionary and

189
00:11:18.290 --> 00:11:21.230
the legal dictionary. So their
way of context is you

190
00:11:21.230 --> 00:11:24.320
tell me the words that
you're likely to do. So

191
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:26.240
over the years, I've had
to build my own dictionary

192
00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:31.250
with words like XML, serializer,
that, you know, the Scott

193
00:11:31.250 --> 00:11:34.610
Hanselman specific grammar, Right. That's,
that's a very similar, you

194
00:11:34.610 --> 00:11:38.180
know, problem that we're trying
to solve up to a

195
00:11:38.180 --> 00:11:40.850
couple of months ago, we
used to have a little

196
00:11:40.850 --> 00:11:45.320
checkbox on our landing page
that would allow people to

197
00:11:45.320 --> 00:11:48.890
actually decide whether the content
that they're trying to translate

198
00:11:48.890 --> 00:11:53.120
is computer related or not.
Right. Because if we could

199
00:11:54.010 --> 00:11:58.000
our own, you know, specific
rules for computer related content,

200
00:11:58.030 --> 00:12:01.570
we would provide better translations.
But that was proved to

201
00:12:01.570 --> 00:12:05.020
be too complicated. And the
average user would not understand

202
00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:08.200
what this little checkbox was
all about. So we are

203
00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.980
now back to a generic
domain, you know, solution where

204
00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:15.910
we are pretty much applying
the same rules across the

205
00:12:15.910 --> 00:12:19.980
board for any document that
you sent for translation. Do

206
00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:21.690
you know how to make
the possible out of the

207
00:12:21.690 --> 00:12:25.140
impossible while the dotnet ninjas
at Telerik? Do they just

208
00:12:25.140 --> 00:12:27.510
released a huge pack of
web controls, all built on

209
00:12:27.510 --> 00:12:31.110
top of ESPN at Ajax,
that'll help you build impossibly

210
00:12:31.110 --> 00:12:34.500
fast and interactive applications in
no time at all. They've

211
00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:38.550
made the impossible possible in
desktop development. If you think

212
00:12:38.550 --> 00:12:40.950
you can't have a carousel
component and wind forms, while

213
00:12:40.950 --> 00:12:44.430
you can. They're windows forms,
suite features a super powerful

214
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.340
grid view control, and 32
other crazy desktop components that

215
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.940
will give you a dazzling
WPF like features, but in

216
00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:53.850
wind farms, they do the
same thing in reporting solutions

217
00:12:53.850 --> 00:12:56.070
with a new design surface,
like nothing else looks just

218
00:12:56.070 --> 00:13:00.630
like graph paper, cause you
advanced page layout capabilities makes

219
00:13:00.630 --> 00:13:02.580
it feel more like a
graphic design software than a

220
00:13:02.580 --> 00:13:07.440
reporting solution. Go check them
out@telerikdotcomandbeat.net Ninja. And thanks for

221
00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:10.860
listening. Now, you're the test
lead for machine translation, but

222
00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.610
you wrote this, this bot,
this agent that's right. And

223
00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:16.290
did you write this from
scratch or is there an

224
00:13:16.290 --> 00:13:19.410
SDK that, can I write
one of these agents? Yes,

225
00:13:19.410 --> 00:13:21.780
you can. But in terms
of what I did one

226
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:25.050
year ago, when I started
thinking about the bot, I

227
00:13:25.050 --> 00:13:29.880
did not have access to
the SDK. I didn't actually

228
00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:34.950
know that Microsoft has an
SDK for writing bots called

229
00:13:34.950 --> 00:13:38.100
live agents. Right? So what
I did basically was to

230
00:13:38.100 --> 00:13:42.840
look around for C sharp
based, you know, interfaces. And

231
00:13:42.870 --> 00:13:45.420
I wrote my little prototype
that ran for about one

232
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:51.300
year based on very low
level protocol handshaking Gene's in

233
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.160
C sharp. So you just
wrote a service that just

234
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:57.240
talked on one end point.
Yes. Basically, like I said,

235
00:13:57.540 --> 00:14:01.410
the bot pretends to be
a human right for messenger.

236
00:14:01.650 --> 00:14:04.110
So it was a little
program that ran in my

237
00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:08.670
server at home that would
log into the messages server.

238
00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:12.060
Right. And I would just
sit down pretty right. So

239
00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:15.630
whenever people invited for a
conversation would reply, ask for

240
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:19.170
the languages and would start
providing translations in the middle.

241
00:14:19.710 --> 00:14:24.120
But, you know, once the
prototype proved to be something

242
00:14:24.120 --> 00:14:29.160
useful, it became clear that
there was an opportunity to

243
00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:31.530
build a real product, But
you did this on your

244
00:14:31.530 --> 00:14:33.630
own. Did the bosses immediately
see that this was a

245
00:14:33.630 --> 00:14:39.330
good idea? It took a
while, but finally this last

246
00:14:39.330 --> 00:14:43.860
September, September, I mean, you
know, we're talking February, February, 2008,

247
00:14:45.150 --> 00:14:48.990
I was invited to show
it on the research tech

248
00:14:48.990 --> 00:14:53.180
Fest. And then it got
the momentum and people start,

249
00:14:53.510 --> 00:14:56.570
you know, thinking about putting
a product that actually, you

250
00:14:56.570 --> 00:15:00.320
know, that does the same.
And this product then is

251
00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:03.860
based on a very reliable
infrastructure. Like I said, called

252
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:09.440
live agents. There's a whole
group supporting the framework. This

253
00:15:09.470 --> 00:15:13.130
product is written in, in
the live agents, scripting language

254
00:15:13.130 --> 00:15:16.000
it's called BuddyScript. Oh, really?
So this isn't like a

255
00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.280
file new window service and
then write the whole thing

256
00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:21.100
in C sharp. They do
it all for you. I

257
00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.280
mean they have, yeah, they
have a runtime. Basically what

258
00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.030
you have to do is,
you know, use their own

259
00:15:28.030 --> 00:15:32.200
scripting language. The runtime will
then on the fly, interpret

260
00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:35.500
this language and start executing
the steps. So it's pretty

261
00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:38.890
cool. And they have a
website that scribes, you know,

262
00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:46.420
how to interact with the
SDK. It's called dev.live.com/agents. And

263
00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:49.180
there's a bunch of documentation
on how to actually write

264
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:50.920
your own book. So where
does it live? It lived

265
00:15:50.920 --> 00:15:53.560
at your house before, where
is the agent now? And

266
00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:57.130
some data centers supported by
the live agents team. And

267
00:15:57.130 --> 00:15:58.870
it's a real thing. Yeah.
If I was going to

268
00:15:58.870 --> 00:16:00.640
write an agent, let's say,
for example, I get a

269
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.310
lot of people chatting me
and asking for help. Right.

270
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.160
If I was going to
make fake Scott Hanselman, right.

271
00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:08.320
That would just maybe send
them random links or tell

272
00:16:08.320 --> 00:16:10.660
them to go search Google
or leave me alone. I

273
00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:12.880
don't want to help you.
Right. How do I, how

274
00:16:12.880 --> 00:16:15.550
do I do this? I
believe that the right way

275
00:16:15.550 --> 00:16:18.640
to do it would be
to install the SDK, following

276
00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.930
the guidelines that they propose
in the documentation. Right. You

277
00:16:22.930 --> 00:16:25.270
can play around with it.
There is a little prototype

278
00:16:25.450 --> 00:16:29.080
module that you can play
around with like using local

279
00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:32.860
host. And once you have
your final version, then you

280
00:16:32.860 --> 00:16:37.960
submit this to their group.
And if they, they want

281
00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:41.570
to publish and, and you
know, there's a whole discussion

282
00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:43.540
on how to do it,
they will get in touch

283
00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:46.150
and COVID, this will be
hosted in the cloud by

284
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.940
them. Yes. So if I
were an ISV that wanted

285
00:16:48.940 --> 00:16:52.960
to provide support or access
to travel information or, or

286
00:16:52.960 --> 00:16:55.550
whatever, I remember years and
years ago, there was an

287
00:16:55.650 --> 00:16:57.520
a bot the very first
part that I ever saw

288
00:16:57.910 --> 00:17:01.810
it's called SmarterChild. Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. I think it

289
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.570
was AOL. And now it's
on live messenger also. Right?

290
00:17:04.870 --> 00:17:08.110
You, you, you probably have
heard about Wilma. Yeah. Yeah.

291
00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:12.010
So that's exactly the same
team that built Wilma. Oh,

292
00:17:12.010 --> 00:17:14.710
wow. So, okay. Pretty cool.
Yeah. This has been a,

293
00:17:14.710 --> 00:17:17.530
along for a long time.
So how do you go

294
00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:20.830
about testing something like machine
translation? I mean, I, you

295
00:17:20.830 --> 00:17:24.220
obviously speak more than one
language. Does that help? Well,

296
00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.280
it, it helps understand how
better of a job we

297
00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:31.840
do sometimes. Right? I mean,
yeah. I speak Portuguese and

298
00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:35.020
the little Spanish and try
to speak English most of

299
00:17:35.020 --> 00:17:39.370
the time. So yeah. I
can spot, you know, bad

300
00:17:39.370 --> 00:17:42.760
translations now. And then now
the statistical system is kind

301
00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.120
of tricky because actually what
you detect is something that

302
00:17:46.120 --> 00:17:51.120
happened way before. So fed
the system once upon a

303
00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:54.510
time and you generated a
model, you deployed this model

304
00:17:54.630 --> 00:17:57.510
to a test environment and
you start testing this model,

305
00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.890
right? So once you detect
a bad translation or something

306
00:18:01.890 --> 00:18:05.710
that is really, really awkward,
it probably means that that

307
00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:10.290
the training process injected something
bad. It doesn't mean that

308
00:18:10.290 --> 00:18:13.200
the model itself is perfect,
but mainly that the training

309
00:18:13.230 --> 00:18:17.130
data that you fed to
the system contains something awkward,

310
00:18:17.610 --> 00:18:21.450
right? So there are basically
two different angles for testing

311
00:18:21.450 --> 00:18:24.600
assistant like that. There is,
of course the basics, you

312
00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:27.090
know, it's a service, it
has to scale. It has

313
00:18:27.090 --> 00:18:29.790
to be reliable. It has
to be accessible, but there's

314
00:18:29.790 --> 00:18:34.950
also the little angle of
language translation quality, which is

315
00:18:34.950 --> 00:18:39.480
really, really complicated. Even though
there are some standard indicators

316
00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:43.890
like the blue scores, which
is a complicated formula for

317
00:18:43.890 --> 00:18:48.570
how to send, you know,
sentences through the system and

318
00:18:48.570 --> 00:18:54.020
try to identify how close
or You actually scored. Yes.

319
00:18:54.050 --> 00:18:57.950
It's part of the nicely
built to generate the blue

320
00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.290
scores and make sure that
we are not completely off

321
00:19:00.680 --> 00:19:03.470
in, in one language. Basically
you have, you know, what

322
00:19:03.470 --> 00:19:06.740
to expect from certain languages
and you, I mean, from

323
00:19:06.740 --> 00:19:09.980
certain sentences and you try
to identify how close or,

324
00:19:10.010 --> 00:19:13.130
or, or not close you
are from, from the, And

325
00:19:13.130 --> 00:19:17.060
other, the statistical models are
on a per language pair.

326
00:19:17.150 --> 00:19:20.060
So that's kind of a
cross product of pairs. Yep.

327
00:19:20.090 --> 00:19:23.550
So you would want to
find, you know, maybe a

328
00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.990
copy of Anne Boleyn written
in English and French, but

329
00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:29.840
also written in French and
Portuguese and you would have

330
00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:33.590
to compare you'd need actually
six translations to get that

331
00:19:33.590 --> 00:19:37.880
working English, French, French. Now
you'll get how complicated. Right.

332
00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:40.880
So the availability of parallel
data is critical for the

333
00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:44.900
system. Okay. And that's definitely
one of the bottlenecks we

334
00:19:44.900 --> 00:19:49.730
have right now, the, the
backend and the system architecture

335
00:19:49.730 --> 00:19:52.520
itself is quite flexible. I'm
not going to say that,

336
00:19:52.550 --> 00:19:55.220
you know, be naive and
say that once you have

337
00:19:55.220 --> 00:19:57.620
the data, you get the
model the next day, but

338
00:19:57.620 --> 00:20:02.780
definitely having good quantity of
parallel sentences is one of

339
00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:05.600
the biggest bottlenecks that we
have nowadays Now, as, as

340
00:20:05.600 --> 00:20:07.490
test lead, is that something
that's your responsibility to go

341
00:20:07.490 --> 00:20:09.170
looking for or who is
out there looking for the

342
00:20:09.170 --> 00:20:12.620
COVID? Oh, there's a bunch
of people looking, looking for

343
00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.900
the right data and also
making sure that we have

344
00:20:15.410 --> 00:20:19.130
the right to actually fetch
and use the data. Right.

345
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:22.670
Because they're two different things.
I mean, once the data

346
00:20:22.670 --> 00:20:25.280
is available, you have to
make sure that you can

347
00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:28.730
use this data, right. Otherwise,
you know, we're things can

348
00:20:28.730 --> 00:20:31.460
happen. It would seem to
me. And I'm just totally,

349
00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.930
I mean, I'm not familiar
with this field, so I'm

350
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.240
brainstorming here, but it seems
to me like the Bible

351
00:20:35.270 --> 00:20:37.580
would probably be a good
place to start in the

352
00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:40.670
sense of it's been translated
typically in any, in any

353
00:20:40.670 --> 00:20:43.250
new language that it's like,
quote unquote discovered whenever the

354
00:20:43.250 --> 00:20:46.430
Western, whenever Western civilization shows
up, the first thing they

355
00:20:46.430 --> 00:20:49.150
do is they try convert
the natives. So they'll write

356
00:20:49.150 --> 00:20:52.510
the Bible in that language.
So that typically represents the

357
00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.270
first biggest chunk of text
in a particular language. What

358
00:20:58.330 --> 00:21:01.590
are you using? Religious texts?
I, I honestly, I don't

359
00:21:01.590 --> 00:21:04.320
know. I know that we
have several different segments of

360
00:21:04.350 --> 00:21:09.810
data and there's a fair
amount of educational data, but

361
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.480
I wouldn't know about religion
at this point in time.

362
00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:13.590
Right. Well, I know you
don't have to, I'm not

363
00:21:13.590 --> 00:21:16.440
asking about religion specifically. I'm
just saying that there's a

364
00:21:16.440 --> 00:21:19.170
lot of Bibles that are
in the, in the public

365
00:21:19.170 --> 00:21:23.190
domain. Yeah. I just don't
know. Yeah. Do you get

366
00:21:23.190 --> 00:21:25.740
into kind of a, a
butterfly effect, like you were

367
00:21:25.740 --> 00:21:28.470
talking about how far back,
you know, butterfly flaps, its

368
00:21:28.470 --> 00:21:33.270
wings in Florida and suddenly
there's a hurricane in Rio.

369
00:21:33.330 --> 00:21:36.120
Do you have situations where
you just can't root cause

370
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.190
something or just go back
and you try to fix

371
00:21:38.190 --> 00:21:42.870
it it'll ruin everything else.
Yeah. Yes. So that's, that's

372
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.090
one of the trickiest part
of this whole thing, right?

373
00:21:45.090 --> 00:21:48.690
Because I mean, given that
it's statistical, I mean, how

374
00:21:48.690 --> 00:21:54.060
many sources of the same
bad translation have you had

375
00:21:54.060 --> 00:21:57.720
the chance to feed the
system to get this bad

376
00:21:57.810 --> 00:22:00.990
result going through? So a
good example to that would

377
00:22:00.990 --> 00:22:04.530
be, let's just assume that
in the future, we have

378
00:22:04.530 --> 00:22:08.310
this collaboration system, right. That
allows you and I to

379
00:22:08.310 --> 00:22:15.390
submit corrections to the documents.
We, we, we, we think

380
00:22:15.390 --> 00:22:21.210
are not properly translated. Right.
So, well, I see a

381
00:22:21.210 --> 00:22:24.480
bad Portuguese translation, right? Click
on the sentence. And I

382
00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.720
go like, no, this should
be the right translation. Okay.

383
00:22:27.750 --> 00:22:30.540
Well, that's great. Right. But
how can assist them? Trust

384
00:22:30.540 --> 00:22:35.970
me, there's no reputation. Absolutely
no reputation building. So, and

385
00:22:35.970 --> 00:22:38.460
it's really easy. I mean,
you can say, Oh yeah,

386
00:22:38.490 --> 00:22:41.340
if you just get one
feedback about this translation probably

387
00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:44.280
is bad, but he can
totally think about political or

388
00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:47.430
even other intentions. Right. That
would have a group of

389
00:22:47.430 --> 00:22:51.930
people translating or, or correcting
his sentence Purpose. Now I'm

390
00:22:51.930 --> 00:22:54.480
realizing that my question about
religious texts was probably a

391
00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:57.090
stupid one because if ever
there were something that could

392
00:22:57.090 --> 00:22:59.970
be argued well, yeah. It
would be religious translation. It's

393
00:22:59.970 --> 00:23:01.860
one of those things, right?
I mean, you have to

394
00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.020
be careful because you have
to build first a very

395
00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:07.410
reliable reputation system to be
able to allow those things,

396
00:23:07.410 --> 00:23:11.910
to, to affect the quality
of your translation Public stuff

397
00:23:11.910 --> 00:23:14.490
now allow you to vote
and have, I don't think

398
00:23:14.490 --> 00:23:16.710
this is right, right. Yes
it does. And you do

399
00:23:16.710 --> 00:23:21.120
take that crowdsourcing that's right,
Right. Yes. It's, it's a

400
00:23:21.120 --> 00:23:23.820
good indication that something is
really bad, but we haven't

401
00:23:23.820 --> 00:23:28.920
developed the reputation system yet
to allow people to actually

402
00:23:29.010 --> 00:23:33.270
enter their corrections. It's something
that, you know, it's, it's

403
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.680
probably going to come in
the near future, but it's,

404
00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:40.680
it's an interesting challenge. Let's
put it this way. It's

405
00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:44.190
not a technical challenge, in
my opinion is more like,

406
00:23:44.190 --> 00:23:51.020
okay, a social and experimental
challenge because you have to

407
00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:53.210
trust humans one way or
the other. And how do

408
00:23:53.210 --> 00:23:55.640
you do that? Well, this,
that, that, that word. I

409
00:23:55.640 --> 00:24:00.250
love that word Outsourcing rather
than outsourcing we're crowdsourcing. Recently

410
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.490
I was on Facebook and
I noticed that Facebook is

411
00:24:04.240 --> 00:24:06.460
trying to translate their site
into every language in the

412
00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:09.730
universe. Just like, just like
Google did, and they're doing

413
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.800
it on a reputation system.
So I went in and

414
00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:14.410
I said, well, I want
to see a Facebook in

415
00:24:14.590 --> 00:24:19.510
Zulu. Right. My wife's language.
So I started translating and

416
00:24:19.510 --> 00:24:21.640
picking different words and, you
know, I know some Zulu.

417
00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:24.250
So I started translating Facebook
into Zulu kind of figure

418
00:24:24.250 --> 00:24:26.710
out what the right Zulu
word for back button was

419
00:24:26.710 --> 00:24:28.480
and all sorts of stuff.
That's cool. And then notice

420
00:24:28.480 --> 00:24:32.860
that that people vote up
or down, but then of

421
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:35.350
course, do we trust those
votes? Are there real people?

422
00:24:35.620 --> 00:24:37.870
Exactly. You have to follow
that all the way back

423
00:24:38.830 --> 00:24:43.270
and I could have huge
statistical ramifications downstream. Absolutely. And

424
00:24:43.270 --> 00:24:46.690
it's much easier for someone
like me or you to

425
00:24:46.690 --> 00:24:48.820
put together something like that
and go like, Hey, help

426
00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:52.060
me translate that. Actually, I
went through a similar process

427
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:56.710
when I first wrote my
little prototype because the whole

428
00:24:56.710 --> 00:25:00.490
dialogue in between the bot
and the human that invoked

429
00:25:00.490 --> 00:25:03.670
the translation was based on
some sentences. Right. So I

430
00:25:03.670 --> 00:25:07.240
would have yourself, you would
have to translate those sentences

431
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.120
to be able to, you
know, start a conversation with

432
00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:12.820
someone in Japan. Right. So
I had to go and

433
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:17.590
crowdsource my first in his
license. And interestingly enough, some,

434
00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.680
some people were actually volunteered
through my little blog. Right.

435
00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.360
I asked for help and
people volunteered their time and,

436
00:25:24.360 --> 00:25:27.340
and, and answer some translations.
I, I try to double

437
00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.120
check if something was really
bad, but you know, it's

438
00:25:31.130 --> 00:25:33.760
worked, but I'm quite sure
that it's one thing to

439
00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:37.510
have a small little pet
project I'm taking this route.

440
00:25:37.510 --> 00:25:40.860
And it's completely different. When
you think about a, a

441
00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.290
product from a big company
like Microsoft or Google or

442
00:25:44.290 --> 00:25:49.330
Apple, there's a lot that
may influence that. You know,

443
00:25:49.330 --> 00:25:53.680
it's not necessarily technical Now
right now, messenger doesn't know

444
00:25:53.680 --> 00:25:56.860
about this because it's just
a fake person out there

445
00:25:56.890 --> 00:26:01.690
with, I presume unlimited friends,
right? The live agents framework

446
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.150
takes care of that. Would
you like to see this

447
00:26:04.150 --> 00:26:07.810
kind of pushed into a
messenger itself? Or is that,

448
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:10.030
is that a goal to
maybe build this into live

449
00:26:10.030 --> 00:26:11.680
messenger so I could click
a button and it would

450
00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:14.860
be a different UI. Love
it. I mean, we should

451
00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:16.840
go talk to those guys.
That would be cool. Absolutely.

452
00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.970
I'm one of those guys
that think that, you know,

453
00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:21.670
machine translation is a cool
feature to have in any

454
00:26:21.670 --> 00:26:26.860
product whatsoever. Right. So I'm,
I'm a firm believer again,

455
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:30.340
that, that broken translation is
way better than no translation

456
00:26:30.340 --> 00:26:34.030
whatsoever. Right. So, and my
example is always the same.

457
00:26:34.030 --> 00:26:36.520
I mean, if I go
to Japan and I'm lost

458
00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.980
and I only have my
cell phone, I guess what

459
00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:41.680
I'm going to use T
bot to ask for help.

460
00:26:41.710 --> 00:26:44.190
Right. Have you ever found
yourself that situation yet? Not

461
00:26:44.190 --> 00:26:47.040
yet. I never went to
Japan. You should go somewhere

462
00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:49.650
and just force that to
happen. Yeah. Yeah. But you

463
00:26:49.650 --> 00:26:52.650
know what? My Spanish is
not so good. And sometimes

464
00:26:52.650 --> 00:26:57.480
I, I joke around with,
with, you know, translations to

465
00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:01.350
Spanish and it does pretty
well. Yeah, yeah. Yeah. I

466
00:27:01.650 --> 00:27:06.540
there's a, there's a comedian
named Eddie Izzard who said

467
00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:08.940
that he doesn't speak, he
speaks French, but the joke

468
00:27:08.940 --> 00:27:11.730
was that he's, he learned
French, but he only learned

469
00:27:11.730 --> 00:27:14.010
a few phrases, you know?
And like, one of them

470
00:27:14.010 --> 00:27:16.470
was like, the cat is
under the table. Right. And

471
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.530
the monkey is in the
branch. Right. So, and he's

472
00:27:19.530 --> 00:27:22.680
like, you know, he learns
<inaudible>, but he has nowhere

473
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:25.260
to use that. So he
goes out into the woods

474
00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.970
and he rents a monkey
and he puts it into

475
00:27:26.970 --> 00:27:30.000
the, just waiting for anyone
who speaks French to walk

476
00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:32.730
by so that he could
find the opportunity to use

477
00:27:32.730 --> 00:27:34.380
it. So I feel like
I'm going to go and

478
00:27:34.650 --> 00:27:36.750
hunt for people who don't
speak English so that I

479
00:27:36.750 --> 00:27:39.630
might be able to talk
to them. Yeah, absolutely. And

480
00:27:39.630 --> 00:27:43.170
this whole mobile solution thing
is, is another, you know,

481
00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:48.150
I think good example of
how the technology is, has

482
00:27:48.150 --> 00:27:51.450
a potential to grow. And,
and I'm not specifically talking

483
00:27:51.450 --> 00:27:55.410
about tea bot, but more
like portable translators. Right. You

484
00:27:55.410 --> 00:27:59.880
know, the possibility of translating
a sentence and maybe adding

485
00:27:59.910 --> 00:28:02.760
TTS text to speech to
it. Right. Right. So the

486
00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:06.720
prototype had text to speech
and when we released the

487
00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:10.200
product, we would choose not
to implement it yet, simply

488
00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:13.470
because of some complexities that,
that have to do with,

489
00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:17.520
how do you actually generate
the audio files, but that's,

490
00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:19.170
you know, one of those
things that are go like,

491
00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.200
well, yeah, if I have
a little mobile thing and

492
00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:24.990
I can press a button
and it, it speaks something

493
00:28:25.140 --> 00:28:28.410
that I, you know, I
need yeah. I'll try it.

494
00:28:28.650 --> 00:28:31.170
It doesn't really matter if
it's perfect or not. Perfect.

495
00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:33.780
I'm quite sure I will
get what I want. Yeah.

496
00:28:33.810 --> 00:28:35.820
Right. Yeah. The only thing
that's keeping us from that

497
00:28:35.820 --> 00:28:39.030
is, is, is really ubiquitous
wireless, you know, do you

498
00:28:39.030 --> 00:28:42.570
have connectivity when you need
exactly. You need connectivity. Exactly.

499
00:28:42.690 --> 00:28:45.420
Interesting. Well, thank you very
much. I've asked you Roberto,
