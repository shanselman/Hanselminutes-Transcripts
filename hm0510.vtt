00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.800
com. It's Hansel minutes, a
weekly discussion with web developer

9
00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.750
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

10
00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.180
514. In this episode, Scott
talks with Dana Lewis about

11
00:01:02.180 --> 00:01:05.180
the open artificial pancreas system
that she and her husband

12
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.320
created. Hi, this is Scott
Hanselman. This is another episode

13
00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.320
of Hansel minutes today. I'm
chatting with Dana Lewis, who

14
00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.830
along with her husband are
a part of open APS

15
00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:22.220
and artificial pancreas system. That
is a open source. And

16
00:01:22.820 --> 00:01:24.320
I think it's so great
that here we are two

17
00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:27.110
diabetics and we're managing our,
our blood sugar in our

18
00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:30.650
diabetes with technology. Thanks for
having me today. No, it's

19
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:35.060
absolutely my pleasure. So let
me start. You're going to

20
00:01:35.060 --> 00:01:37.370
talk 90% of the podcast,
but I wanted to just

21
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:39.470
set a little bit of
a level set for people

22
00:01:39.470 --> 00:01:42.770
who are listening. We are
both type one diabetics, which

23
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:45.320
means we don't make any
insulin as opposed to type

24
00:01:45.320 --> 00:01:49.130
two diabetics or what used
to be called adult onset.

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:53.270
But for us, there's no,
no amount of yoga or

26
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:57.200
green tea or cinnamon. I
mean, you've had people, I

27
00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:59.570
assume, I assume after this
podcast, everyone is gonna say,

28
00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:01.790
Oh, I'm so sorry. I
heard you're diabetic here. Try

29
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:04.160
some yoga and green tea.
That's not going to solve

30
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:08.390
this for us. Is it
right? And that's no disrespect

31
00:02:08.390 --> 00:02:10.460
to our very well meaning
listeners who may want to

32
00:02:10.460 --> 00:02:13.490
give us some other system
what's different about our diabetes

33
00:02:13.790 --> 00:02:16.940
than, than the kind that
maybe a little yoga and

34
00:02:16.940 --> 00:02:20.060
a little green tea could
help with. Well, the big

35
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:23.180
difference is no insulin means
that you have to check

36
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:25.700
your blood sugar and then
also give yourself insulin. And

37
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.530
that could be through shots
that could be using an

38
00:02:27.530 --> 00:02:31.130
insulin pump. And it means
constant measurement of everything, what

39
00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:33.680
you eat when you exercise
and everything else that goes

40
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.170
along with life. Right? And
when the, when our, I

41
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:38.270
mean, when we say our
pancreas is don't do anything,

42
00:02:38.630 --> 00:02:40.550
this is why, you know,
green tea might give us

43
00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:42.980
other health benefits or yoga
or whatever. These could all

44
00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:46.310
improve things, but it doesn't
solve the underlying problem with,

45
00:02:46.940 --> 00:02:49.190
with our pancreas, which is
it's not doing any work.

46
00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:53.300
So that's what we talk
about artificial pancreas. Exactly. And

47
00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:55.340
that's one of the confusions.
When we talk about artificial

48
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.820
pancreas, we're not implanting an
Oregon. We are not doing

49
00:02:58.820 --> 00:03:00.910
that. What we were trying
to do is replicate some

50
00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.400
of the same function, which
is moderating the amount of

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:06.240
insulin in response to the
glucose in our body. I

52
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:09.180
see. So this isn't a,
a perfect replication. It's not

53
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:14.040
an implanted Oregon. It's not
even a hundred percent simulacrum

54
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:17.190
of a pancreas. It's just
doing the kind of like

55
00:03:17.190 --> 00:03:20.460
I've been diabetic 23 years.
You've been diabetic. How long?

56
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.640
14 years, so many, many,
many years you were doing

57
00:03:23.640 --> 00:03:26.100
these calculations yourself. You know,
you look at some food

58
00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.630
and you go, wow, it
looks like about this much

59
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:30.720
insulin. You weigh at this,
all these different ways. It's

60
00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.050
a constant measurement, not once
a day, but five, six

61
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.660
times a day, you're doing
this. I actually heard an

62
00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:40.230
interesting number that is 300
plus decisions a day that

63
00:03:40.230 --> 00:03:42.450
impact your diabetes. So I
don't know if that sounds

64
00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:44.670
or feels more like what
you experienced, but that's more

65
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:47.220
aligned with my experience. Yeah,
that's a good, that's an

66
00:03:47.220 --> 00:03:48.810
interesting way to put it.
So like, when I say

67
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:50.850
five, seven times a day,
I'm thinking about like major

68
00:03:50.850 --> 00:03:54.150
meals, snacks, those are all
decision points. But you know,

69
00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:58.350
actually back in 2007, when
Twitter started, I tweeted my

70
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.870
blood sugar for a day
and I didn't just tweet,

71
00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:03.060
Hey, here's my blood sugar.
What I decided I would

72
00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:06.360
do is every decision point
I would tweet about like,

73
00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:08.430
Oh, I want a cookie,
but I can't have one

74
00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:10.830
or, Oh, I'm going to
go for a walk, but

75
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:13.350
I'm having a low blood
sugar. So it was, I

76
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:15.660
think it would have ended
up being about 176. Yeah,

77
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.700
that sounds about right. And
so that's exactly the point

78
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:20.070
of open APS is it
takes some of the mental

79
00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:22.560
math out of the picture.
And it says, you're doing

80
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:24.390
this math over and over
again. And if you're paying

81
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.820
attention great, but if you
want to focus on work

82
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:28.740
or you want to watch
a football game or you

83
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:31.440
want to sleep, you know,
that's not something you want

84
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.390
to do constantly throughout the
day. So the point of

85
00:04:33.390 --> 00:04:36.990
open APS is it takes
the data. It inter-operates between

86
00:04:36.990 --> 00:04:40.020
medical devices that were previously
incompatible and you couldn't talk

87
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:43.320
to each other, does that
math. And then actually since

88
00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.170
the decision in an ax,
a command into the system,

89
00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:47.970
reads the data back and
does it over and over

90
00:04:47.970 --> 00:04:50.670
again, we humans get tired
of those hundreds of decisions

91
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:52.890
a day. And that's why
you start to stop making

92
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:54.960
as many decisions. If you
have a bad day or

93
00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:57.360
you're tired or you're sick.
But the system, when it

94
00:04:57.360 --> 00:04:59.760
runs just keeps going every
five minutes or every three

95
00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.520
minutes, however you program it,
it's going to keep reading

96
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:05.610
the data, making decision, reading,
the data, making a decision.

97
00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.630
Yeah. One of the things
that's absolutely a repeated when

98
00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:12.300
you talk to diabetics is
there's this fatigue, there's this

99
00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:16.650
decision fatigue. And some people
hit it 20, 30 years

100
00:05:16.650 --> 00:05:18.270
into their diabetes. And some
people hit it a few

101
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:20.280
months into it. And I've,
I've, I've met a number

102
00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:22.800
of folks that have just
basically, can I just given

103
00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:24.060
up and I'm like, you
know, this is as good

104
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:25.620
as it's going to get
from my blood sugar. I'm

105
00:05:25.620 --> 00:05:28.350
just so tired every single
day. I just want one

106
00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:31.500
day off. Does this give
you a day off? It

107
00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.120
doesn't give me a day
off and know with the

108
00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.610
system. And I'd love to
explain to people exactly what

109
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.560
it is. Cause people probably
have some question marks over

110
00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:40.950
their head, but to answer
your question first, it's still

111
00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:43.950
work. I still wear an
insulin pump. I still wear

112
00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.950
a continuous glucose monitor. I
still calibrate test my blood

113
00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.530
sugar with finger sticks multiple
times a day. I still

114
00:05:49.530 --> 00:05:52.260
count the carbs and what
I eat to figure out

115
00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.600
what my meal dose is.
But this fills in the

116
00:05:54.600 --> 00:05:58.310
gaps. It softens the edges
on any human errors that

117
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:01.220
I might make. And it
kind of rounds off the

118
00:06:01.220 --> 00:06:03.710
errors of, of life and
the things that affect your

119
00:06:03.710 --> 00:06:06.830
blood sugar, which is really
amazing. So I was explaining

120
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:09.860
to somebody yesterday that it's
still work. It's not a

121
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.890
cure. I still have diabetes,
but it's less work and

122
00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:15.770
less burden and causes less
fatigue than if I didn't

123
00:06:15.770 --> 00:06:18.430
have the system at all.
Okay. So let me do

124
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.230
my analogy and we'll go
from there and you can

125
00:06:20.230 --> 00:06:22.600
explain exactly how this works
and how, how you've closed

126
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.240
the loop. I always use
the analogy of an airplane

127
00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:27.550
flying from one side of
the country, to the other,

128
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.220
and in a world of
finger sticks where you check

129
00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.970
your blood sugar with a
finger stick and manual injections,

130
00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:37.930
the finger stick is like
checking your altitude. And the

131
00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:41.800
injection is adjusting your altitude
with the stick. And you

132
00:06:41.800 --> 00:06:44.590
only get to check your
fingers, your altitude five or

133
00:06:44.590 --> 00:06:47.260
10 times, and you only
get to give yourself manual

134
00:06:47.260 --> 00:06:50.530
injections five or 10 times.
So wouldn't that be a

135
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:56.320
jerky flight from LA to
New York? And you're adjusting your

136
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:59.800
altitude with continuous glucose meters.
Like the one that we

137
00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:03.190
both wear, I'm getting hundreds
of data values and with

138
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:06.580
a pump, I can make
little tiny adjustments. So it's

139
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:10.570
really an issue of resolution.
Isn't it? Exactly. And that's

140
00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:13.930
the thing is that CGM
and pumps are better than

141
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:17.170
finger sticks and, you know,
manual injections for a lot

142
00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:18.880
of people, a lot of
people choose to wear these

143
00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:22.480
devices, but you still have
to constantly check between what

144
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.970
is device aid doing and
what his device be doing.

145
00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:27.730
And if you choose to
get these devices from different

146
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:30.940
manufacturers, it's even harder to
go between the two devices.

147
00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.310
And again, do that mental
calculation in your head about

148
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:35.650
what needs to be done.
And that's where, you know,

149
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:38.620
not paying attention or fatigue
starts to come into play.

150
00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:41.200
And it's more easy for
somebody to not do the

151
00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:44.560
really precise mathematical count calculation
and round up or down

152
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.020
based on what's easiest for
what they're doing at that

153
00:07:47.020 --> 00:07:49.960
moment. Right? And even a
little bit of not paying

154
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:52.720
attention just as well in
an airplane, you can find

155
00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:57.100
yourself off course, a real
world example just literally an

156
00:07:57.100 --> 00:07:59.530
hour ago, before I got
on the phone with you.

157
00:08:00.230 --> 00:08:02.260
I noticed that my blood
sugar, I'm looking at my

158
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:04.900
CGM right here and it
just slowly ever so slowly

159
00:08:04.900 --> 00:08:08.410
over a period of two
hours creeped up and it's

160
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.730
not bad right now, but
it's not great. And it,

161
00:08:12.850 --> 00:08:15.910
it just happened because for
two hours, I didn't look

162
00:08:15.910 --> 00:08:20.470
at my, my meter. That's
an example of like, Oh

163
00:08:20.470 --> 00:08:23.050
wow, wait, I'm 3000 feet
higher than I should be.

164
00:08:23.050 --> 00:08:25.330
Where's the mountain I've lost.
And then I suddenly I

165
00:08:25.330 --> 00:08:27.580
have to make a correction.
And now I'm on a

166
00:08:27.580 --> 00:08:31.630
roller coaster bouncing up and
down in my altitude, smoothing

167
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.090
that out would be wonderful.
Well, the other thing that's

168
00:08:34.090 --> 00:08:36.820
challenging that I don't think
a lot of people understand

169
00:08:36.820 --> 00:08:39.610
is that you're constantly playing
catch up because the insulin

170
00:08:39.820 --> 00:08:42.910
doesn't work immediately. You might
give yourself a dose to

171
00:08:42.910 --> 00:08:45.550
adjust to the number, but
that insulin, depending on your

172
00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:47.380
body and the type of
insulin may not peak in

173
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:50.350
your body for 60 minutes
to beyond that. So you

174
00:08:50.350 --> 00:08:52.900
have to make a decision
looking ahead that says, what

175
00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.470
am I right now? Where
is my trend heading? Am

176
00:08:55.470 --> 00:08:57.900
I going up or down?
What am I going to

177
00:08:57.900 --> 00:08:59.940
be doing in an hour?
Because for example, if I'm

178
00:08:59.940 --> 00:09:01.440
going to go for a
run in an hour, maybe

179
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.810
I don't want to correct.
If I'm slowly rising, I

180
00:09:03.810 --> 00:09:05.610
want it to be a
little bit higher, but if

181
00:09:05.610 --> 00:09:07.650
I'm getting ready to go
eat, wow, I need that

182
00:09:07.650 --> 00:09:09.510
insulin now. So that when
I go into the meal,

183
00:09:09.810 --> 00:09:11.520
I'm in a better place
than I am right now.

184
00:09:11.670 --> 00:09:13.050
And you don't always know
what you're going to be

185
00:09:13.050 --> 00:09:15.690
doing. And you don't know
if you're on finger sticks,

186
00:09:15.690 --> 00:09:17.850
which way your blood sugar's
heading. And that's kind of

187
00:09:17.850 --> 00:09:20.640
the challenge is it's a
lot of snap in time

188
00:09:21.030 --> 00:09:23.790
decision making, but it's also,
you're trying to prepare for

189
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:26.430
one hour ahead or three
hours ahead. And sometimes that's

190
00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:27.900
impossible and you just have
to do the best you

191
00:09:27.900 --> 00:09:32.600
can, but it's really fun.
So applying your very important

192
00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:36.530
point about lag, they taking
insulin and having can take

193
00:09:36.530 --> 00:09:38.630
a while or looking at
your blood sugar and having

194
00:09:38.630 --> 00:09:41.360
it, not reflect reality. Applying
that to the analogy around

195
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:44.690
an airplane. When I look
at the altimeter, it's really

196
00:09:44.690 --> 00:09:48.050
not. Now it's 15, 20
minutes ago. And when I

197
00:09:48.050 --> 00:09:50.270
suddenly go, Oh no, pull
up, pull up or push

198
00:09:50.270 --> 00:09:52.250
down, push down. I pull
on the stick to adjust

199
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:56.630
my altitude. Nothing happens for
an hour. Exactly. So now

200
00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.400
have a smooth flight and
suddenly you see it. It's

201
00:09:58.400 --> 00:09:59.810
a lot more, it's like,
you know, controlling a Mars

202
00:09:59.810 --> 00:10:01.610
Lander. It's like you move
the joystick and you wait

203
00:10:01.610 --> 00:10:04.940
eight minutes for the thing
to do anything All while

204
00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:07.040
again, trying to live your
life, doing whatever it is

205
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:10.100
you do, making a living
enjoying yourself. So it's not

206
00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:12.500
like people want to constantly
be doing this decision making.

207
00:10:12.710 --> 00:10:14.960
It's not like the flight
where you have, you know,

208
00:10:14.960 --> 00:10:16.790
you get on the plane
and you're going to fly

209
00:10:16.790 --> 00:10:19.820
from point a to point
B life it's day in

210
00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.620
and day out. It's every
single day over and over

211
00:10:21.620 --> 00:10:23.600
again. There's not that start
and stop point. You don't

212
00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:26.420
turn diabetes off. And I
think that's the big frustration

213
00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:27.980
is people just want a
break. They want a day

214
00:10:27.980 --> 00:10:31.970
off, but it's a 24,
seven, three 65 constant flight

215
00:10:31.970 --> 00:10:35.690
adjustment Is now why is
it that people who, you

216
00:10:35.690 --> 00:10:39.440
know what I call the
normal sugared? Why do the

217
00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:42.230
normals hear about these things?
And they go, well, why

218
00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:45.230
don't you just do this?
And why don't you just

219
00:10:45.230 --> 00:10:47.360
do that? It seems like
the word just always gets

220
00:10:47.360 --> 00:10:51.020
applied diabetes. Like surely they've
solved this by now. Or

221
00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:52.400
they see that you're wearing
a pump and they go,

222
00:10:52.430 --> 00:10:54.050
Oh, well, it just takes
care of it for you.

223
00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:56.540
It seems to be like
a way of coping with

224
00:10:56.540 --> 00:10:59.120
the fact that it really
isn't easy, but they really

225
00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.750
want it to be. I'm
laughing here thinking back to

226
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:06.560
experience. Most people with diabetes
have when they meet somebody

227
00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.230
new, a new friend, somebody
who becomes their significant other,

228
00:11:09.590 --> 00:11:13.010
everybody's like, Oh, well, doesn't
device a toxic to device

229
00:11:13.010 --> 00:11:16.220
B. Well, like of course
my iPhone talks to my

230
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.500
computer. I can get my
data off my camera onto

231
00:11:18.500 --> 00:11:22.520
my computer or this idea
of interoperability, healthcare and medical

232
00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:26.870
devices in particular are very
behind. It's very different than

233
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:28.940
anything else that you can
imagine. So for somebody who

234
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:32.390
doesn't work in healthcare and
doesn't have somebody they know

235
00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:35.780
with a chronic illness, diabetes,
or otherwise, it's very hard

236
00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:38.660
to fathom until they get
some of these insights and

237
00:11:38.660 --> 00:11:40.160
kind of see some of
the data. And here's some

238
00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:42.500
of the stories. So as
we talk about open APS,

239
00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.380
that's one of the reasons
I'm very avid about sharing

240
00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:49.670
my experience because it helps
people start to understand what

241
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:52.460
are the true challenges of
living with something like this?

242
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.960
Why are we thousands of
hours trying to solve this

243
00:11:55.960 --> 00:11:59.560
problem? It's because, well, it's
not just that easy for

244
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.330
anybody. It requires a lot
of work and a lot

245
00:12:01.330 --> 00:12:04.060
of effort. And until we
have a cure, we've got

246
00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:07.120
to do better. And I
believe that we're not moving

247
00:12:07.120 --> 00:12:09.100
fast enough in terms of
the healthcare industry. And we've

248
00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:11.290
got to fill that gap.
So that's, that's what we're

249
00:12:11.290 --> 00:12:13.810
doing. But I imagine we'll
still hear a lot of

250
00:12:13.810 --> 00:12:16.540
responses to this podcast of,
Oh, well, what about X,

251
00:12:16.540 --> 00:12:18.910
Y, Z? Why don't you
just do this? And the

252
00:12:18.910 --> 00:12:20.410
other point I'd like to
make is that for every

253
00:12:20.410 --> 00:12:24.970
single person with diabetes, their
diabetes may vary. It's different

254
00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.600
based on, you know, their
body, their health, what they

255
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:30.550
talk about with their doctor,
their lifestyle, and what they

256
00:12:30.550 --> 00:12:34.060
decide is important. That whole
thing will help them figure

257
00:12:34.060 --> 00:12:35.800
out what they need to
do. There's no one right

258
00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:38.080
thing for everybody. What works
for me? Doesn't work for

259
00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:40.930
you, Scott, what works for
you, doesn't work for, you

260
00:12:40.930 --> 00:12:42.820
know, the other person we
know with type one diabetes

261
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.280
or type two diabetes, everybody's
really, really different. And so

262
00:12:45.280 --> 00:12:47.050
that's one of the things
I think is cool is

263
00:12:47.380 --> 00:12:49.660
we're working to build options
so that if you have,

264
00:12:50.020 --> 00:12:53.260
you know, pumping CGMB, you
can make these things work

265
00:12:53.260 --> 00:12:56.260
together. But if you have
different devices or maybe you

266
00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.210
don't choose to have a
pump, maybe you like multiple

267
00:12:58.210 --> 00:13:01.120
daily injections, you know, that
you could find something to

268
00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:04.330
learn from this technology use
that applies to you and

269
00:13:04.330 --> 00:13:05.740
helps you. And I think
that's one of the cool

270
00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:08.920
things we're starting to see
is this respect for everybody's

271
00:13:08.920 --> 00:13:11.620
individual choices, but taking what
we can learn from each

272
00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:15.130
other's experiences and this different
pieces of technology and just

273
00:13:15.130 --> 00:13:17.260
gain a better understanding of
diabetes and how it works

274
00:13:17.260 --> 00:13:22.200
for each of us. This
episode of Hansel minutes is

275
00:13:22.200 --> 00:13:26.250

So let's, let's take an

289
00:14:21.660 --> 00:14:25.460
inventory of the things that
you need and what, what

290
00:14:25.570 --> 00:14:27.930
we talk about the closed
loop. Let's talk about this

291
00:14:27.930 --> 00:14:31.140
loop. So you need a
monitor, something to tell you

292
00:14:31.140 --> 00:14:33.270
what your blood sugar is
now, and you need a

293
00:14:33.270 --> 00:14:37.500
delivery thing. So you talked
about pumps, which deliver pumps.

294
00:14:37.650 --> 00:14:41.370
Don't usually look at your
blood sugar. They deliver, they

295
00:14:41.370 --> 00:14:45.600
are they're they're they're the
right solution, right? W R

296
00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:49.290
I T E well, a
CGM, a continuous glucose meter

297
00:14:49.290 --> 00:14:52.610
is the Reed. And we
tend to have ones with

298
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:55.010
different brands, right? Like mine
are different brand. Yours are

299
00:14:55.010 --> 00:14:59.750
also different brands, totally different
companies that don't presumably talk

300
00:14:59.750 --> 00:15:01.910
to each other. There's no
standard. Like I can go

301
00:15:01.910 --> 00:15:04.190
to my car, plug my
Bluetooth in and Hey, look,

302
00:15:04.190 --> 00:15:06.800
it works. They've never talked
to each other. There is

303
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:08.450
not yet a standard for
that kind of stuff. It's

304
00:15:08.450 --> 00:15:12.200
coming someday. But like you
said, we're years behind. So

305
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.380
you have these two devices.
Where's the loop here. What's

306
00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.110
how do you decide, like
you, you look at one

307
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:19.880
and you think, and you
make a decision and then

308
00:15:19.880 --> 00:15:22.930
you push a button on
the other. Yeah. So historically

309
00:15:22.930 --> 00:15:24.790
for those without diabetes, what
you would do is you

310
00:15:24.790 --> 00:15:26.500
would either do a finger
stick or look at your

311
00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:29.170
continuous glucose monitor and see
what your blood sugar is.

312
00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:32.100
And then again, do this
decision based on your body,

313
00:15:32.470 --> 00:15:35.350
your ratios, and say, I
need more insulin. I need

314
00:15:35.350 --> 00:15:37.720
less insulin. I need to
eat. If it applies to

315
00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.970
insulin, I need more or
less. You would look at

316
00:15:39.970 --> 00:15:42.310
your pump and say, okay,
I'm going to put this

317
00:15:42.310 --> 00:15:44.920
into my pump. More insulin,
less insulin. It would deliver

318
00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.290
again with the lag time,
you wouldn't see it go

319
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:50.830
into impact immediately, but then
60 minutes later, you would

320
00:15:50.830 --> 00:15:53.260
look at your blood sugar
again and say, okay, more

321
00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:56.080
or less, et cetera. But
again, your body, your brain

322
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:59.500
is that decision maker and
that button pusher. So with

323
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:02.380
a closed loop, what we're
talking about is some kind

324
00:16:02.380 --> 00:16:04.870
of computer system that will
read the data from the

325
00:16:04.870 --> 00:16:08.110
CGM, do some kind of
calculation that your brain normally

326
00:16:08.110 --> 00:16:11.050
would do, and then send
a command to the pump.

327
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:14.350
Now, ideally, this would be
an all in one single

328
00:16:14.350 --> 00:16:17.500
system that is coming on
the market. And we could

329
00:16:17.500 --> 00:16:20.170
talk about what commercial options
look like. But the key

330
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:23.710
point here, it's not available
today. It was not available

331
00:16:23.710 --> 00:16:26.020
two years ago, 10 years
ago when a lot of

332
00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:28.570
us wanted it. So we
started figuring out, you know,

333
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:32.050
if we could get the
data off the device, which

334
00:16:32.260 --> 00:16:34.180
again was a struggle many,
many years ago, but as

335
00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:36.990
of two or three years
ago, with Nightscout, Dexcom share

336
00:16:37.010 --> 00:16:38.950
mini med connect, that's becoming
easier to get the data

337
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.260
off the CGM so that
you can get a quicker,

338
00:16:41.260 --> 00:16:43.780
real time view of your
glucose data, because we can

339
00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:46.030
get the data off more
easily. You're able to add

340
00:16:46.030 --> 00:16:48.280
other data to it. Like,
what is the pump doing?

341
00:16:48.580 --> 00:16:50.470
What are you eating? And
as a result of all

342
00:16:50.470 --> 00:16:53.710
this data, you can actually
basically build a prediction engine

343
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:56.590
that says, because this is
the trend. This is what

344
00:16:56.590 --> 00:16:59.110
your altitude is because of
the weather conditions, because of

345
00:16:59.110 --> 00:17:02.020
all the things going on,
we expect that you're going

346
00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.480
to the plane is going
to lower where your blood

347
00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:06.670
sugar is going to lower.
And as a result, we

348
00:17:06.670 --> 00:17:09.760
need to adjust by giving
you less insulin to help

349
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:12.520
you blood sugar level off
the plane level off. And

350
00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.130
so that's exactly what the
system is doing now in

351
00:17:15.130 --> 00:17:17.890
terms of what is that
piece of hardware? Again, we

352
00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:20.260
don't have an all in
one system. And as of

353
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:22.150
a week ago, I would
have told you there's one

354
00:17:22.150 --> 00:17:24.490
working solution. But as of
this week, we've actually got

355
00:17:24.790 --> 00:17:27.220
three different hardware options that'll
work. But the point is

356
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:30.430
you need a small computer
and you need something that

357
00:17:30.430 --> 00:17:33.700
will talk to the device.
The first set of option

358
00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:35.710
that we made work over
a year ago is a

359
00:17:35.710 --> 00:17:39.190
raspberry pie, which is a
small mini computer that a

360
00:17:39.190 --> 00:17:41.380
lot of people listening to
this podcast are probably familiar

361
00:17:41.380 --> 00:17:43.870
with. And that kind of
became the brain of the

362
00:17:43.870 --> 00:17:46.540
system. And the other thing
we used for the longest

363
00:17:46.540 --> 00:17:49.380
time is a CareLink USB
stick, which is actually made

364
00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:52.470
by the pump manufacturer to
read data off the pump.

365
00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:56.280
But we found that there
was a little security hole

366
00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.730
that everybody freaked out about
years ago. There's this big

367
00:17:59.730 --> 00:18:03.000
cybersecurity scare of, Oh no.
Somebody, if they had your

368
00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:05.520
serial number of your pump,
they had this CareLink stick

369
00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:07.920
and they were within three
feet of you. They could

370
00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:11.160
push insulin to your pump
without you knowing it, remember

371
00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:14.940
that. And so everybody freaked
out the FDA decided that

372
00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:18.330
Medtronic needed to change that.
And so Medtronic would swap

373
00:18:18.330 --> 00:18:20.700
out the firmwares pumps came
back and all feature pumps

374
00:18:20.970 --> 00:18:23.070
did not have this feature
enabled. So that's why you'll

375
00:18:23.070 --> 00:18:26.220
hear us talking about older
generation Medtronic pumps for the

376
00:18:26.230 --> 00:18:31.430
system that still have the
security option enabled. So to

377
00:18:31.430 --> 00:18:33.530
put this in layman's terms
is this kind of like

378
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.020
rooting your iPhone. And then
they came up with a

379
00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:39.230
newer version and now you
can't route it. Okay. So

380
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.020
then to, to, to give
the pump a command to

381
00:18:42.020 --> 00:18:44.960
say, give me this much
insulin, I need an older

382
00:18:44.960 --> 00:18:47.180
one that doesn't have that,
that I'm actually using the

383
00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:50.660
security hole. So you, I
just got a new pump

384
00:18:50.690 --> 00:18:53.630
last week because mine was
out of warranty. I have

385
00:18:53.630 --> 00:18:56.870
version three, you have an
older one and you'll have

386
00:18:56.870 --> 00:18:59.360
to stay on that one
forever until there's a standard

387
00:18:59.360 --> 00:19:03.050
for, for delivering insulin. No,
but will choose to in

388
00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.870
order to work with open
APS. Absolutely. So I, to

389
00:19:05.870 --> 00:19:08.540
have a more modern pump
that does not have this

390
00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:11.780
feature enabled, that was my
in warranty pump. And I

391
00:19:11.780 --> 00:19:13.490
stopped using it about a
year and a half ago

392
00:19:13.490 --> 00:19:16.400
because I found one that
worked with this closed loop

393
00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:19.460
system. And I want to
talk a little bit more

394
00:19:19.460 --> 00:19:22.040
about the, the security of
this before we talk about

395
00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.200
the hardware, because a lot
of people say, Oh gosh,

396
00:19:24.230 --> 00:19:26.360
I would never, why are
you doing that? That's so

397
00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:29.090
insecure, et cetera, et cetera.
And this is where we

398
00:19:29.090 --> 00:19:31.070
get to talk about the
limitations of the physical hardware

399
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:33.440
system. Like I mentioned, you
have to have the exact

400
00:19:33.500 --> 00:19:35.720
serial number of the pump.
It's actually kind of hard

401
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:38.660
to get because the pump
is attached to your body

402
00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.910
with pump tubing. And most
people have a clip over

403
00:19:40.910 --> 00:19:42.770
the back. And a serial
number is hidden on the

404
00:19:42.770 --> 00:19:44.390
back end of the clip.
So you would have to

405
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:47.540
be a very good friend
or family member of somebody

406
00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:49.520
to get ahold of their
pump. Without them noticing it,

407
00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.050
get the serial number, plug
it into a system, build

408
00:19:54.050 --> 00:19:57.170
it, be able to test
it without them knowing and

409
00:19:57.170 --> 00:19:59.120
be able to issue a
command. The pump has a

410
00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:02.120
bunch of hardware, safety things
built in. That's a really

411
00:20:02.120 --> 00:20:05.240
great, like when you do
insulin delivery, it'll buzz or

412
00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.640
beep based on your settings.
So if somebody did something

413
00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:09.590
to your pump, without you
noticing it, you would get

414
00:20:09.590 --> 00:20:12.650
a buzzer. Beep additionally, you
have the backup feature of

415
00:20:12.950 --> 00:20:15.590
tracking your blood sugar. So
if you suddenly started dropping,

416
00:20:15.710 --> 00:20:17.690
you would check your pump
and say, what did I

417
00:20:17.690 --> 00:20:20.120
do an hour ago? That's
making me drop now. And

418
00:20:20.120 --> 00:20:22.280
you would look and say,
huh? I don't remember that.

419
00:20:22.970 --> 00:20:24.890
Usually it's because you did
something in your sleep. Like

420
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:26.660
you woke up, gave yourself
a bolus, cause you thought

421
00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:28.190
it was a good idea
at the time and you

422
00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:30.440
get back to sleep. But
in the rear case that

423
00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:33.650
somebody was maliciously trying to
deliver insulin to you. There's

424
00:20:33.650 --> 00:20:36.020
a lot of work and
effort and a lot of

425
00:20:36.230 --> 00:20:38.610
frequency dances that would have
to happen for it to

426
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:41.210
Well, and it also has
a maximum amount that it

427
00:20:41.210 --> 00:20:43.610
will give you in a
certain period of time and

428
00:20:43.910 --> 00:20:46.550
it's a dangerous amount, but
it's not like deathly dangerous

429
00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:48.970
and you set it yourself.
Like 10 units is an

430
00:20:48.970 --> 00:20:50.860
amount of insulin that my
pump is set to be

431
00:20:50.860 --> 00:20:52.870
the max. It would give
me a bad day, but

432
00:20:52.870 --> 00:20:57.150
it wouldn't kill me. I
notice it. Right. And you

433
00:20:57.150 --> 00:20:59.370
would probably notice it before
it got to a very

434
00:20:59.370 --> 00:21:02.400
severe point. Okay. I'd likely
feel it going in as

435
00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:04.590
well. That's a lot of
insulin And again, the beeping,

436
00:21:04.620 --> 00:21:06.840
and you would have to
notice somebody within three feet

437
00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.930
of you with this device
And you can't exactly pick

438
00:21:09.930 --> 00:21:12.150
pockets. Something when it's literally
has a two foot cord

439
00:21:12.570 --> 00:21:16.230
attached to your body, it
hurts. And so I just,

440
00:21:16.260 --> 00:21:17.730
I just want to kind
of set that out of

441
00:21:17.730 --> 00:21:19.650
the way. So as we
move forward, talking about open

442
00:21:19.650 --> 00:21:22.080
APS, say, yes, we are
using this kind of quote

443
00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.960
security hack, but it's, it's
not what people think when

444
00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:27.560
they hear that we quote
hat. So this is a

445
00:21:27.570 --> 00:21:31.320
really, really great point. We,
you you're, you're using the

446
00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:33.810
pump and the features that
it had available to it.

447
00:21:33.870 --> 00:21:37.080
There's no, there's no maliciousness.
It's a hack for good,

448
00:21:37.140 --> 00:21:42.360
at best, but wouldn't that
then imply that the company

449
00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.920
that makes the pump and
the companies that make the

450
00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:46.560
TJ could have done what
you all have done themselves,

451
00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.590
but maybe haven't chose to
because of either regulations or

452
00:21:50.190 --> 00:21:53.430
potential fear of being sued.
Yeah. So the companies that

453
00:21:53.430 --> 00:21:56.850
we're talking about are working
on closed loop systems, but

454
00:21:56.850 --> 00:22:00.750
because they are big traditional
institutions because they are working

455
00:22:00.750 --> 00:22:04.470
through traditional clinical trials and
regulatory pathways, they are working

456
00:22:04.470 --> 00:22:06.000
on a closed loop system,
but it's not going to

457
00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:09.180
come to market until 2017
at the earliest. And that's

458
00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:12.180
the whole point with open
APS is there are closed

459
00:22:12.180 --> 00:22:16.320
lips coming, but because we
have the technology available and

460
00:22:16.620 --> 00:22:18.630
we have the community of
people, who've helped us figure

461
00:22:18.630 --> 00:22:20.100
out how to do this
and how to make it

462
00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:23.340
better and better in terms
of hardware and software, because

463
00:22:23.340 --> 00:22:24.990
we believe we can do
it safely. We don't think

464
00:22:24.990 --> 00:22:27.120
there's a reason for us
individually to choose to wait.

465
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:28.800
If we want the system,
we can build it and

466
00:22:28.800 --> 00:22:31.020
do it. And that's kind
of the core of open

467
00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.130
APS. It's about, there's a
reference design. There's this implementation.

468
00:22:35.130 --> 00:22:37.880
That's open source. We're not
forcing it on anybody, but

469
00:22:38.250 --> 00:22:40.200
if you want to build
it yourself, if you don't

470
00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:42.150
want to wait and you
think this would help you,

471
00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:46.020
whether it's for overnight or,
you know, everyday use, then

472
00:22:46.020 --> 00:22:48.030
you know, it's there for
you to, for you to

473
00:22:48.030 --> 00:22:51.900
build it. The manufacturers have
a different approach and process,

474
00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:54.900
and it obviously takes a
lot more time, you know,

475
00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:57.270
to get a system through
FDA approval. Our thing is

476
00:22:57.270 --> 00:23:00.840
not FDA approved. It likely
won't be. But again, it's

477
00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:02.820
the open source approach of
if you want to use

478
00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:05.430
it, you can, and there's
a community to support. But

479
00:23:05.730 --> 00:23:08.100
the reason we emphasize DIY
a lot, if you look

480
00:23:08.100 --> 00:23:10.380
at the open APS documentation
online, you'll see a blog

481
00:23:10.380 --> 00:23:12.930
post. I wrote that I
linked to. That's why the

482
00:23:12.930 --> 00:23:16.110
DIY is important because when
something breaks and it will

483
00:23:16.110 --> 00:23:19.320
break, you have to know
how to fix it, where

484
00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:20.940
you have to know that
it's broken and you have

485
00:23:20.940 --> 00:23:23.400
to be OK with it.
It's not a, Oh my,

486
00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.010
you know, something physically broke
off, but it's well, it's

487
00:23:26.010 --> 00:23:28.170
no longer reading from this
device where it's no longer

488
00:23:28.170 --> 00:23:31.110
writing to the pump or
I don't, I'm not quite

489
00:23:31.110 --> 00:23:33.750
sure what's happening in Y.
So it's up to you

490
00:23:33.750 --> 00:23:35.970
as the individual using the
system to be able to

491
00:23:35.970 --> 00:23:38.610
troubleshoot and put the pieces
back together or get back

492
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:40.860
in range of the device
or whatever it is that

493
00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.800
you need to do. But
because of all this, the

494
00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:48.590
open APS design is actually
designed for failure. We don't

495
00:23:48.590 --> 00:23:51.200
do boluses, which is like
a big burst of insulin.

496
00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.710
Like we've talked about. We
only do micro adjustments called

497
00:23:54.740 --> 00:23:59.740
temp, basal rates. I see.
Okay. So you're not taking

498
00:23:59.740 --> 00:24:02.080
care of lunch for me.
You're taking care of like

499
00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:04.360
the example that I gave
at the very beginning where

500
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.270
I wasn't paying attention for
two hours and my altitude,

501
00:24:07.300 --> 00:24:10.150
my blood sugar slowly creeped
up to the point where

502
00:24:10.150 --> 00:24:13.450
it was actionable. Would that
be like, is a good

503
00:24:13.450 --> 00:24:16.360
analogy saying my car was
kind of slowly creeping out

504
00:24:16.360 --> 00:24:18.370
of its lane on the
freeway. And if someone were

505
00:24:18.370 --> 00:24:20.320
just watching the lines, they
could have kept me in

506
00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.050
the like, it's not a
self driving car, but it

507
00:24:23.050 --> 00:24:25.090
certainly would be nice to
just automatically stay in the

508
00:24:25.090 --> 00:24:27.130
lanes. Well, I would think
about it. Yeah. Or you

509
00:24:27.130 --> 00:24:28.630
could also think about it
more about speed. Like you

510
00:24:28.630 --> 00:24:31.450
really want to maintain 60
miles per hour or 30

511
00:24:31.450 --> 00:24:33.550
miles per hour. Yeah. It's
more like cruise control of,

512
00:24:33.550 --> 00:24:35.830
wow. Your foot came off
the gas, you started slowing

513
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:38.350
down. We need to speed
you back up or you're

514
00:24:38.350 --> 00:24:40.450
going too fast. We need
to tap on the brakes.

515
00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:43.540
Gently, not a full stop,
but just, let's just slow

516
00:24:43.540 --> 00:24:45.940
you down incrementally and that's
right. That's a great analogy.

517
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.490
Cause that's, that's, that's very
clear. Like we all know

518
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:52.360
what adaptive cruise control is,
right? It keeps distance between

519
00:24:52.360 --> 00:24:54.130
the car and the car
in front of you, but

520
00:24:54.130 --> 00:24:56.500
it is not a self
driving car. Right. And that's

521
00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.680
exactly what this does because
if your blood sugar rises

522
00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:02.110
slowly, like your example, you
need a little bit more

523
00:25:02.110 --> 00:25:05.230
insulin over time. And if
your blood sugar slowly drops

524
00:25:05.230 --> 00:25:08.500
and you're not paying attention,
you need less insulin. And

525
00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:10.960
so that's what the system
does is it says you

526
00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:13.780
have these preprogrammed basal rates
on your pump. Let's say

527
00:25:13.780 --> 00:25:16.000
an average might be one
unit per day in the

528
00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:20.740
morning. Now in the afternoon,
one unit per hour, I'm

529
00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.780
starting in the morning and
the afternoon, it might be

530
00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:25.900
1.3. And then in the
evening, before you go to

531
00:25:25.900 --> 00:25:29.320
bed, it might drop to
0.8 units per hour. So

532
00:25:29.350 --> 00:25:32.830
just little micro adjustments based
on your body, your schedule

533
00:25:32.830 --> 00:25:35.860
and what you know works.
But on Monday you go

534
00:25:35.860 --> 00:25:38.260
to the gym in the
afternoon, whereas Tuesday you don't.

535
00:25:38.470 --> 00:25:41.650
So on Monday you might
need less insulin. So most

536
00:25:41.650 --> 00:25:44.380
people will manually start hours
ahead saying, I'm going to

537
00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:46.450
the gym. I'm going to
eat my snack, do my

538
00:25:46.450 --> 00:25:50.620
protein shake, reduce my insulin,
yada, yada, yada, all these

539
00:25:50.620 --> 00:25:54.670
different tweaks in order to
have good or better blood

540
00:25:54.670 --> 00:25:58.690
sugars or better reaction to
that experience. But you can't,

541
00:25:58.840 --> 00:26:01.570
it's really hard to constantly
change your basal rate throughout

542
00:26:01.570 --> 00:26:03.160
the day. If you're manually
doing this, you can do

543
00:26:03.160 --> 00:26:05.530
it. But just like everything
else, it's really exhausting. So

544
00:26:05.530 --> 00:26:07.360
the point of this Forget,
right? It's like putting your

545
00:26:07.360 --> 00:26:08.710
phone on. I'm just trying
to give the analogy is

546
00:26:08.710 --> 00:26:10.570
for people who are normal
people to it's like putting

547
00:26:10.570 --> 00:26:12.850
your phone on silent, you
know? Yeah. And then one

548
00:26:12.850 --> 00:26:14.410
day you don't and then
your phone goes off in

549
00:26:14.410 --> 00:26:16.870
church or whatever. Like it's
just, at some point you

550
00:26:16.870 --> 00:26:20.380
just get tired and, and
it's exhausting. And the thing

551
00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:23.530
that's so bad about diabetes
is that, you know, people

552
00:26:23.530 --> 00:26:26.470
will ask you or I,
how are we doing? And

553
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:28.480
we don't know. I'll let
you know when we're 60

554
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:30.940
and we're not dead. Well,
the other analogy that I

555
00:26:30.940 --> 00:26:32.860
think about that I think
people could relate to is

556
00:26:32.860 --> 00:26:35.290
this idea of geolocation. Like,
wouldn't it be great if

557
00:26:35.710 --> 00:26:38.140
when you got to work
or when you left work,

558
00:26:38.350 --> 00:26:40.420
your phone noticed that you
left work instead of text

559
00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:42.730
your spouse. That said, I'm
on my way home. I'll

560
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:46.050
be, I'll be home in
20 minutes. And the spouse

561
00:26:46.050 --> 00:26:47.580
or partner who needed to
know it for whatever reason

562
00:26:47.580 --> 00:26:50.220
could put dinner in or
take dinner out or get

563
00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:51.990
the kids ready or whatever
it is that you needed

564
00:26:51.990 --> 00:26:55.200
to do. That's the same
idea of this system is

565
00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:57.900
we start to notice a
change in your location, a

566
00:26:57.900 --> 00:27:00.540
blood sugar. So you, you
walked out the door, your

567
00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:02.820
blood sugar started dropping. We
don't know if you walked

568
00:27:02.820 --> 00:27:04.770
for coffee or your walk,
or you got in the

569
00:27:04.770 --> 00:27:06.900
car to come home, but
we're going to, we're going

570
00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:09.030
to change something as a
result. And if we need

571
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:11.160
to we'll change back. If
you go back into the

572
00:27:11.160 --> 00:27:12.810
building and you go back
to work, cause you just

573
00:27:12.810 --> 00:27:15.030
went for coffee for five
minutes, no big deal. But

574
00:27:15.030 --> 00:27:16.500
if we know you end
up getting more than three

575
00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:19.140
blocks away, that probably means
you're going home. So we'll

576
00:27:19.140 --> 00:27:21.870
send the text. And the
same thing with the system

577
00:27:21.870 --> 00:27:25.710
is if you have one
data point that's really extreme,

578
00:27:26.100 --> 00:27:28.650
it will react and respond
with a high or a

579
00:27:28.650 --> 00:27:31.260
low temp as we call
it. But if they've been

580
00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:33.840
resumed back, wow, that was
just a really fluky data

581
00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:36.480
point. Because just for whatever
reason, you had this one

582
00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.730
weird data point, we're not
relying on that single data

583
00:27:38.730 --> 00:27:43.140
point. We're relying on an
average and the deviation on

584
00:27:43.140 --> 00:27:46.140
the trend line. Exactly. And
we can respond to that.

585
00:27:46.200 --> 00:27:48.930
But if you really did
go straight up or straight

586
00:27:48.930 --> 00:27:51.030
down, it is the safest
thing to do to respond

587
00:27:51.030 --> 00:27:54.750
to that. So the system
is taking into account all

588
00:27:54.750 --> 00:27:57.570
of these things. But what
I was talking about in

589
00:27:57.570 --> 00:28:00.360
terms of designing for failure,
because we've got these temporary

590
00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.700
basal rates, we have them
enacted for 30 minutes at

591
00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:04.860
a time, which means if
you walk out of range

592
00:28:04.860 --> 00:28:07.680
of system, the minute that
command is issued, it's gonna

593
00:28:07.680 --> 00:28:10.440
be the safest possible thing
to do for 30 minutes

594
00:28:10.620 --> 00:28:12.780
based on the data available.
And at the end of

595
00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:14.730
that, if you're still at
a range of the system,

596
00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.880
it reverts back to your
standard. Basal rates is preprogrammed

597
00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:20.640
insulin. So when we talk
about, okay, what happens if

598
00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:22.500
it fails? What happens if
it breaks? If you go

599
00:28:22.500 --> 00:28:24.570
out of range, it goes
back to what we call

600
00:28:24.570 --> 00:28:27.030
quote, standard of care, which
is your pump just continues,

601
00:28:27.030 --> 00:28:29.880
issuing the insulin. It's not
the greatest setup. We would

602
00:28:29.880 --> 00:28:32.130
love to have it auto
reading all the time. But

603
00:28:32.130 --> 00:28:34.050
for the average person walking
around without a closed loop

604
00:28:34.050 --> 00:28:36.750
system, that's what they do
every day. The pump, regardless

605
00:28:36.750 --> 00:28:39.960
of the situation, especially overnight,
regardless of what your blood

606
00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.830
sugar is, it issues that
standard preprogrammed insulin rate and

607
00:28:43.830 --> 00:28:45.930
with the system, our system
does is if it's in

608
00:28:45.930 --> 00:28:48.660
range, it reads, it says
you need more or less

609
00:28:49.080 --> 00:28:52.260
it enacts. It reads back
that that happened, adjusted the

610
00:28:52.260 --> 00:28:54.930
data reads again and does
it over and over and

611
00:28:54.930 --> 00:28:56.940
over again. But again, if
you walk away from it,

612
00:28:56.940 --> 00:29:00.510
something breaks for whatever reason,
it's, it's okay. It reverts

613
00:29:00.510 --> 00:29:03.300
back to the standard. It's
not like we're taking basic

614
00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:05.450
insulin away from you. One
of the things that I

615
00:29:05.450 --> 00:29:08.120
like about the open source
approach and about the open

616
00:29:08.210 --> 00:29:13.580
APS approach versus whatever the
big corporations will do is

617
00:29:13.580 --> 00:29:17.210
while they're all well-meaning, while
there are often diabetics involved

618
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:21.860
here, you've got diabetics building
software for diabetics, which really

619
00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:24.470
gets to this idea of
user centered design, right? You're

620
00:29:24.470 --> 00:29:27.350
building in features that matter
to you because you're wearing

621
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:30.440
the thing 24 hours a
day, like you're living this,

622
00:29:30.830 --> 00:29:33.860
of course, it's going to
be what you want. Well,

623
00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:35.600
who knows if the thing
that you said might come

624
00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.520
out in 2017, it's going
to be what we want

625
00:29:37.550 --> 00:29:39.860
or if it will be
a shadow. Yeah. And that's,

626
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.090
that's something that's interesting to
me because when we first

627
00:29:43.090 --> 00:29:46.420
quote, close the loop, I
did it for myself based

628
00:29:46.420 --> 00:29:48.790
off of a previous kind
of alert and algorithm system

629
00:29:48.790 --> 00:29:50.800
I had built that was
manual. You know, it gave

630
00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:52.660
me an alert and said,
you need to take action.

631
00:29:52.690 --> 00:29:54.850
We recommend this much, but
I, as a human would

632
00:29:54.850 --> 00:29:57.310
press the button. What we
basically did is use this

633
00:29:57.580 --> 00:30:00.550
physical hardware setup to close
the loop and communicate between

634
00:30:00.550 --> 00:30:02.470
the devices to create this
close loop. So it was

635
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:04.840
easier than we thought it
would be to actually close

636
00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:07.600
the loop because we had
been building and testing this

637
00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:12.310
recommendation engine for about a
year, but everybody said, well,

638
00:30:12.580 --> 00:30:14.920
you're in of one. It's
just you. How do we

639
00:30:14.920 --> 00:30:16.810
know what's going to work
for anybody else? We said,

640
00:30:16.810 --> 00:30:20.140
well, maybe it won't, but
we believe it will help

641
00:30:20.140 --> 00:30:21.820
other people. And we want
to find a way to

642
00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:24.370
make it open source and
find a way so that

643
00:30:24.370 --> 00:30:26.710
somebody else who wants to
build their own, doesn't have

644
00:30:26.710 --> 00:30:29.560
to spend two years building
the system like we did.

645
00:30:29.830 --> 00:30:32.650
And so that's how it
became open APS and this

646
00:30:32.650 --> 00:30:36.190
open source movement around, we
can't give it to you

647
00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.930
because of FDA regulations of
distributing classroom medical, right? You're

648
00:30:39.930 --> 00:30:43.860
not in it. You're not
selling the Distributing, but the

649
00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:47.370
reference design is online and
open aps.org. There is documentation

650
00:30:47.370 --> 00:30:49.800
on GitHub. There is code
available for you to review

651
00:30:49.800 --> 00:30:53.940
and potentially implement based on
get hub. And we, and

652
00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:56.550
we did that because we
wanted people to be able

653
00:30:56.550 --> 00:30:58.890
to do that. And what's
been really cool is seeing

654
00:30:58.890 --> 00:31:02.430
in the past calendar year,
we have gone from one

655
00:31:02.430 --> 00:31:06.330
person to now, 30 people
using the system and using

656
00:31:06.330 --> 00:31:09.120
it overnight. And it's not
just adults. It's also kids,

657
00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:11.280
parents who built it for
their kids. We have 17

658
00:31:11.670 --> 00:31:15.390
adults, I believe, and 12
kids using the system. And

659
00:31:15.390 --> 00:31:17.910
it's pretty amazing that it
works for people of all

660
00:31:17.910 --> 00:31:21.300
ages, all sizes, all links
of times of experience with

661
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:24.660
diabetes. So in the remaining
minute or two that we've

662
00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:26.880
got on the podcast here,
let's look forward in the

663
00:31:26.880 --> 00:31:30.120
future a little bit because
you've built effectively a bridge

664
00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.360
between API APIs. Like, you
know, this is very interesting

665
00:31:33.360 --> 00:31:34.920
for people who might be
listening, who may have built

666
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.800
bridges between API APIs, except
that what's so interesting about

667
00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.190
this. As we have these
bridges to APIs that are

668
00:31:41.190 --> 00:31:43.680
our own bodies, right? We
are affecting ourselves. Like you

669
00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:47.040
have a personal area network
effectively where you have an

670
00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:49.470
API to get your blood
sugar and an API to

671
00:31:49.830 --> 00:31:53.070
deliver insulin. But we also
have things like Fitbits. And

672
00:31:53.070 --> 00:31:56.700
you mentioned geolocation, I've got
a Microsoft band. I did

673
00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.280
a demo at build where
I integrated those. Is it

674
00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.130
possible that we could do
things like, Oh, she's going

675
00:32:02.130 --> 00:32:04.530
for a run. I'll go
into going for a run

676
00:32:04.530 --> 00:32:08.310
mode because I can see
that from this personal area

677
00:32:08.310 --> 00:32:10.830
network that she's wearing. And
the thing that people will

678
00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:12.330
I get asked the most
is what about a heart

679
00:32:12.330 --> 00:32:15.090
rate monitor? People are very
interested in incorporating heart rate

680
00:32:15.090 --> 00:32:19.230
monitors, but all these features
are possible. Absolutely possible. You,

681
00:32:19.250 --> 00:32:21.360
you leave the school, you
know, it's time for PE

682
00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.030
you know, you, your system
needs to do XYZ. So

683
00:32:24.030 --> 00:32:27.870
some of that predictive alerts
versus just reactive. So that's

684
00:32:27.870 --> 00:32:31.080
definitely in the future. It's
definitely possible. And as more

685
00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.480
people come on board, it'll
be interesting to see what

686
00:32:33.480 --> 00:32:35.280
happens. And I think the
other cool thing is thinking

687
00:32:35.280 --> 00:32:38.160
about how this open source
community is going to affect

688
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:41.720
the manufacturers and the traditional
products that'll come to market.

689
00:32:41.810 --> 00:32:44.570
I think we're learning some
important things about how people

690
00:32:45.110 --> 00:32:49.070
use these systems, what things
are important, like it's okay

691
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.170
for the user to do
meal bowls. The system does

692
00:32:51.170 --> 00:32:53.540
good enough picking up and
rounding the edges of the

693
00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:57.200
user error. What's more important
is, you know, X, Y,

694
00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.150
Z, and that kind of
thing. And I think that's,

695
00:32:59.150 --> 00:33:02.060
what's really neat about this
project is because we are

696
00:33:02.060 --> 00:33:05.090
kind of closing the gap
and bridging also between the

697
00:33:05.090 --> 00:33:08.480
stakeholders. So the traditional manufacturers
who are doing clinical trials

698
00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:10.820
with devices, as well as
the FDA and bringing that

699
00:33:10.820 --> 00:33:13.340
user centered design approach to
say, we've got a system

700
00:33:13.340 --> 00:33:16.490
that is basic, safe and
ineffective and more so than

701
00:33:16.490 --> 00:33:19.010
standard of care, you know,
how is your system going

702
00:33:19.010 --> 00:33:20.450
to compare to that? And
what do we need to

703
00:33:20.450 --> 00:33:22.370
do to make your thing
better so that when it

704
00:33:22.370 --> 00:33:24.170
does come out and people
do want an all in

705
00:33:24.170 --> 00:33:26.810
one device, they can purchase
it and understand how it

706
00:33:26.810 --> 00:33:30.820
works and use it. Absolutely.
Very cool. So last question.

707
00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:32.980
Where can people go to
get involved, to learn about

708
00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:36.850
open APS, Open aps.org. That'll
link you to our docs.

709
00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.640
It'll link you to our
open source code and it'll

710
00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.500
link you to us if
you need to get a

711
00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:44.500
hold of us and ask
us Very cool. Dana M

712
00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:46.480
Lewis. Thanks so much for
chatting with me today. Thank

713
00:33:46.480 --> 00:33:49.570
you so much. This has
been another episode of Hansel

714
00:33:49.570 --> 00:33:59.290
minutes and we'll see you
again. Next time. <inaudible>.
