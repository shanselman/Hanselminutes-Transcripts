00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:51.110
com. It's Hansel minutes, a
weekly discussion with web developer

9
00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:56.180
and technologist Scott Hanselman. This
is Lawrence Ryan announcing show number

10
00:00:56.180 --> 00:01:00.950
566. In this episode, Scott
talks with laser and Walker

11
00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:04.760
about the current state of
STEM science, technology, engineering, and

12
00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:12.920
math Learning. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman. This is another

13
00:01:12.920 --> 00:01:16.180
episode of Hansel minutes today.
I'm talking with Lauren Walker. He

14
00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:19.730
is a technology entrepreneur and
Atlanta native. It's got some

15
00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.670
amazing stuff he's working on
right now around STEM. How

16
00:01:22.670 --> 00:01:25.490
are you sir? Doing well?
How about yourself, Scott? I'm

17
00:01:25.490 --> 00:01:27.680
pretty excited to be talking
to you. I'm feeling good.

18
00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.030
My, my eight year old
actually he's nine now. And

19
00:01:32.030 --> 00:01:34.100
I, you know, are, do
a lot of, you know,

20
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.460
kind of STEM and steam
science, technology engineering, and math

21
00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:41.450
type stuff. Yesterday. He asked
that he wanted a, an

22
00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:44.960
Alexa like an echo in
his, in his room. Like,

23
00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.670
why do you want this?
Why, why do you need

24
00:01:46.670 --> 00:01:49.010
this in your life? And
it's because he wanted to

25
00:01:49.010 --> 00:01:51.710
play music. So I didn't
want to, I didn't want

26
00:01:51.710 --> 00:01:54.350
to give him that. I
feel that it's too, it's

27
00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:57.380
too immediate. They're too late.
It's, there's a laziness factor

28
00:01:57.380 --> 00:01:59.390
there. You know, they want
the sum total of all

29
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.320
human knowledge available like that.
So I said, if you

30
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.330
want a radio like that
in your room, then you

31
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:07.010
have to build it. So
then we went off and

32
00:02:07.010 --> 00:02:10.430
we've got a raspberry pie.
We went to Goodwill, we

33
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:14.730
built, we built a little
streaming internet radio. I wanted

34
00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.750
to make it more real.
And I know that's something

35
00:02:17.750 --> 00:02:20.150
that you really care about.
And that's a big part

36
00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.680
of what we do, man.
Cause they're just like yourself.

37
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:24.050
I guess I was like,
you're saying years ago. And

38
00:02:24.260 --> 00:02:27.140
so I went down the
path of engineering school and

39
00:02:27.140 --> 00:02:29.870
to come and let you
engineer undergraduate graduate school. But

40
00:02:29.870 --> 00:02:31.910
one of the things I
realized when I got farther

41
00:02:31.910 --> 00:02:34.430
along is that a lot
of my peers, they, they

42
00:02:34.460 --> 00:02:36.170
came in ready to go.
And if you look at

43
00:02:36.170 --> 00:02:39.080
their experiences, a lot of
those guys or girls, they

44
00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:41.780
had access to things when
they were growing up. And

45
00:02:42.140 --> 00:02:44.150
when you look at that,
a lot of kids now

46
00:02:44.150 --> 00:02:46.490
don't get that exposure. So
in our companies, what we

47
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.710
focus on is how do
you find a way to

48
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.560
make sure that education is
engaged and accessible and affordable.

49
00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:55.040
And so spend a lot
of our time creating tool

50
00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:57.410
sets to make that possible.
And so I can, our

51
00:02:57.410 --> 00:02:59.530
three D printing business is
just like your, we have

52
00:02:59.530 --> 00:03:03.460
a company Called my STEM
kits.com. And with that particular

53
00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:05.860
business, we realized that the
three D printers is an

54
00:03:05.860 --> 00:03:09.280
amazing tool that is being
severely under utilized in schools.

55
00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.190
And so we went out
and created a library of

56
00:03:12.190 --> 00:03:14.710
over 140 different things that
you can three D print

57
00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:18.940
plug and play that were
aligned to the education standards,

58
00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.760
but let people like your,
your son get access to

59
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:24.250
tools and manipulatives that they
can use that were aligned

60
00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.810
to their, what they were
doing in school, but also

61
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:28.030
find it engaging. And so
that's a really big part

62
00:03:28.030 --> 00:03:29.800
of what we do. And
it's good to hear that

63
00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:30.910
story and what you've done
with your son at home,

64
00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.280
because a lot of parents
don't have that ability to

65
00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:35.500
make that happen. And the
ones that do want to

66
00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.210
make it happen, don't have
access to resources to do

67
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.130
that. Yeah, I think that,
that, that, that's really, that's

68
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:42.750
really the essence of what
we want to talk about

69
00:03:42.750 --> 00:03:45.930
today because I've, I've my,
my son goes to a

70
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:49.290
local public school as a
charter school. And when we

71
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:52.200
go in there, you know,
they they'll get a, they'll

72
00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:53.880
get a grant. Someone will
give him a three D

73
00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:55.500
printer or they'll get a
grant and they'll get a

74
00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:58.560
box of Arduinos. And they'll,
you know, they'll poke at

75
00:03:58.560 --> 00:04:00.450
it for awhile, but I
don't really feel like the

76
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.820
teachers have the resources to
understand why this is why

77
00:04:02.820 --> 00:04:05.100
this is useful. Like they'll
spend a day, they'll get

78
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:08.700
the led to blink. And
then it just sits in

79
00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:11.520
the corner. And frankly, the
three D printer until like,

80
00:04:11.550 --> 00:04:14.760
until I kind of came
along and wanted to start

81
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:16.710
acting, it'd be more practical.
It just kind of been

82
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.860
sitting there. Yeah. And not
only that, like you said,

83
00:04:19.860 --> 00:04:21.840
they, they want to get
engaged. But as an example,

84
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:23.400
we're doing some work down
in Florida now where we're

85
00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:25.530
combining some of the work
with three D printing. In

86
00:04:25.530 --> 00:04:27.750
addition to the work that
we're doing with sensors, where

87
00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.660
a lot of times the
science teachers are the ones

88
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:34.140
responsible for teaching computing and
things along those lines. And

89
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:36.360
they're not very motivated with
going out to, like, in

90
00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.400
my case last week, I
was looking at trying to

91
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.140
do some things with an
adrenal. So I went out

92
00:04:40.140 --> 00:04:41.910
and I think I got
like a spark fund kit.

93
00:04:41.910 --> 00:04:44.640
Right. And I played with
it. All those particular lessons

94
00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:46.950
are focused very heavily on
how do you program what

95
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:50.460
an Adreno, none of those
lessons or telling a science

96
00:04:50.460 --> 00:04:53.070
or math teacher, how programming
is a Draino is going

97
00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:55.260
to help your kid learn
what their most important mission

98
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:58.320
is or most important goals
are. And so being able

99
00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.620
to take those lessons and
build out solutions that are

100
00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:04.110
focused on the standard, which
is what a teacher wants

101
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:06.780
to teach, helps them really
embrace that. So as an

102
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.240
example, this summer, one of
the progress that we're pushing

103
00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.840
out is it's a series
of lessons that take hardware,

104
00:05:13.060 --> 00:05:16.530
IOT devices that we create
three D printable kits. And

105
00:05:16.530 --> 00:05:19.080
we're going through an entire
set of lessons that start

106
00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:22.650
from the math and science
and computer science standards. We're

107
00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:26.550
teaching kids how to program
scratch I'm focused on the

108
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:29.460
standard itself. And by the
way, it just happens to

109
00:05:29.460 --> 00:05:32.160
include computing with it as
well. And so that will

110
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.580
allow for that science teacher
to get behind it, expose

111
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:38.220
it, not be intimidated by
it, but also get that

112
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:40.440
kid to play with devices
and hardware, which is what

113
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.090
they want to do as
well. So trying to close

114
00:05:42.090 --> 00:05:44.910
that ecosystem, I think will
really help solve some of

115
00:05:44.910 --> 00:05:47.070
the problems that you were
seeing and your own scenario.

116
00:05:47.880 --> 00:05:50.070
Yeah. I mean, it's asking
a lot of a teacher

117
00:05:50.310 --> 00:05:52.350
to learn how to do
deal with the three D

118
00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:57.560
printer and then, you know,
be, be creative and come

119
00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:00.500
up with the bridge between
whatever they're teaching, whatever standard

120
00:06:00.500 --> 00:06:03.500
that they're teaching and what
they can imagine that they

121
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:06.140
could create. You know, I
don't want this to be

122
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:08.300
an advertisement for my STEM
kits, but I will tell

123
00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.220
you that the reason that
I reached out to you

124
00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.710
to do the podcast is
that I saw you're on

125
00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:15.170
your Twitter account. I would
recommend that people who are

126
00:06:15.170 --> 00:06:17.660
listening to the show, go
check it out. It's my

127
00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.610
S T E M kits
and go to the, the

128
00:06:20.720 --> 00:06:24.020
photos section. Like, I'll give
you like an example, right?

129
00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:26.870
Like we all did like
potential energy and kinetic energy,

130
00:06:26.870 --> 00:06:30.980
like in school, you know?
And it's usually like, you

131
00:06:30.980 --> 00:06:34.070
know, taking a hot wheels
car down a ramp, you

132
00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:35.570
know what I mean? And
then there's value in that.

133
00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.570
But you know, you created
like an energy roller coaster

134
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:44.450
kit, very specific curve to
show how energy moves from

135
00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:47.330
place to place. And you
print everything out from scratch.

136
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.560
The, the, the, the creativity
in the three D printing

137
00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.930
stuff and the imagination there
is what you're kind of

138
00:06:53.930 --> 00:06:55.940
like, what's, you're paying for,
I don't know who you

139
00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:58.460
got to do that, but
it's amazing. It's this is

140
00:06:58.610 --> 00:07:01.400
hundreds and hundreds of kits
that I wish I had

141
00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.030
in school when I was
coming up. And that's, what's

142
00:07:04.030 --> 00:07:07.240
fun about it as well.
In that particular initiative. Also,

143
00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.980
we work a lot with
some creative people down at

144
00:07:08.980 --> 00:07:11.770
Florida state university, where there's
an entire team of just

145
00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:15.010
educators and teachers and master
teachers that have taught in

146
00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:17.290
the classroom. So every kid
you see out there, not

147
00:07:17.290 --> 00:07:20.230
only was it created to
allow for that experience to

148
00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:22.600
be it's important teacher to
use the printer. They also

149
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:25.900
were, they've been testing and
using the classroom. So every

150
00:07:25.900 --> 00:07:28.990
kid has gone through multiple
iterations. So by the time

151
00:07:28.990 --> 00:07:31.570
he gets to our portal,
they've been used and for

152
00:07:31.570 --> 00:07:34.660
each potential, each kid that's
out there, we have one

153
00:07:34.660 --> 00:07:36.640
or more lessons assigned to
it. So if you're a

154
00:07:36.640 --> 00:07:39.160
fifth grade teacher who wants
to teach that potential energy

155
00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:41.380
scenario, you could go and
just go to this map

156
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.230
section and say, give me
a five grade five example,

157
00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:46.000
and it will show you
less than it will show

158
00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:49.360
you standards aligned curriculum that
you can use. And the

159
00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:51.490
idea for this is very
simple is how can you

160
00:07:51.490 --> 00:07:56.230
create the biggest and most
robust library of STEM aligned

161
00:07:56.230 --> 00:07:59.470
manipulatives that can be used
that are relevant. And in

162
00:07:59.470 --> 00:08:03.040
some cases, a value proposition,
just scenarios that, and we

163
00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.880
have examples as an example
where a lot of anatomy

164
00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:09.190
type classes or things along
those lines have allergy lessons,

165
00:08:09.550 --> 00:08:11.380
they have bird skulls and
things. And I always tell

166
00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:13.150
people to think that, like,
if you wanted to go

167
00:08:13.160 --> 00:08:14.950
and do something in your
classroom with a skull, a

168
00:08:14.950 --> 00:08:17.770
bird has to die, right?
So those things are very

169
00:08:17.770 --> 00:08:20.660
expensive. So, or in some
cases, maybe it's an example

170
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.320
on anatomy where it's a
small species, so like a

171
00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:25.300
pigeon skull or something, and
you don't want to kindergarten

172
00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:27.670
working with that small fragile
thing. And so a lot

173
00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:30.670
of cases, we have kits
that we've created that can't

174
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:34.240
necessarily purchase a bot, so
they can, they're very expensive

175
00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:36.280
to produce. But in other
cases, there are things that

176
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:38.830
you just can't manufacture a
mold. And so it opens

177
00:08:38.830 --> 00:08:42.160
up the possibilities there. And
the third thing that we

178
00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.570
do there is that a
lot of times three D

179
00:08:43.570 --> 00:08:45.940
printing is not as a
lot of people assume that

180
00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:48.670
three D printing really is
about just scanning a pitcher

181
00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:51.370
and printing something out. And
that experience of design and

182
00:08:51.370 --> 00:08:53.530
a model, you know, putting
it on an SD card,

183
00:08:53.680 --> 00:08:56.160
popping it into a computer
and it becomes very kind

184
00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.560
of cumbersome. And so in
our use case, what we've

185
00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.540
done is that we built
out a platform to where

186
00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:03.630
you can onboard pretty much
any major printer in the

187
00:09:03.630 --> 00:09:06.990
market and directly stream to
the printer. So within a

188
00:09:06.990 --> 00:09:10.080
classroom, a teacher can log
in browse, a collection of

189
00:09:10.080 --> 00:09:13.080
files. They want segmented by
standard and grade and hit

190
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.360
the print button. And when
they do that, it literally

191
00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.090
starts to stream to their
printer instead of making demystifying

192
00:09:18.090 --> 00:09:20.550
that three D printing experience,
but making it relevant has

193
00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.890
been a big part of
our focus. And we were

194
00:09:22.890 --> 00:09:24.510
getting a lot of good
reception around that. And we're

195
00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:26.790
hopeful that with this current
approach, we can reach more

196
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.820
kids. And again, back to
the model before making it

197
00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.000
engaging, accessible, and affordable so
that anybody who has this

198
00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.740
can kind of get engaged.
That's a really big part

199
00:09:34.740 --> 00:09:37.920
of my passion, the mission
these days. Yeah. That, that

200
00:09:37.940 --> 00:09:41.210
aspect of things is so
important because you as a

201
00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.490
three D printer person myself,
I would have to say

202
00:09:43.490 --> 00:09:47.180
that probably 60% of my
time is thinking about how

203
00:09:47.180 --> 00:09:48.950
to get the thing to
print the thing, you know,

204
00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:51.200
like laying it out on
the, on the, you know,

205
00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:53.600
when you get the model,
someone hands you the model,

206
00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:56.000
and typically it's, it's public
domain. It's a model that

207
00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.030
you find on Thingiverse. You
have to place it on

208
00:09:59.030 --> 00:10:03.860
the, on the, on the
print surface oriented, appropriately set

209
00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:08.030
up the supports correctly. You
have to think like, imagine

210
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.370
if someone gave you a
word document and you had

211
00:10:10.370 --> 00:10:12.470
to figure out the right
size, the right margins, the

212
00:10:12.470 --> 00:10:16.460
right fonts, none of that
was included. That's all barriers

213
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.850
to prevent me or a
teacher from, from just success.

214
00:10:20.930 --> 00:10:22.610
Yeah, it is. Yeah. And
so in our case, you

215
00:10:22.610 --> 00:10:25.430
mentioned, what does that, so
Hannah Olson is that people go

216
00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:27.080
and they go and look
at Twitter, they'll see Hannah

217
00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:29.030
out there. And she, I
call it a STEM goddess.

218
00:10:29.030 --> 00:10:32.180
Like she is an amazing
person. And her particular case

219
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.400
has a background in modeling
with the school for doing

220
00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.530
that. And so having that
type of person on our

221
00:10:36.530 --> 00:10:39.110
team, that's able to go
through and got our team

222
00:10:39.110 --> 00:10:42.260
of modelers to build these
things out and not just

223
00:10:42.260 --> 00:10:45.110
assemble it as you mentioned,
but setting specific settings per

224
00:10:45.110 --> 00:10:47.690
printer. So in some cases,
that's an example. We always

225
00:10:47.690 --> 00:10:49.490
show, we have an example
of a kit, which is

226
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:51.860
a density cubes kit. And
it's nice because the three

227
00:10:51.860 --> 00:10:53.060
D printing, and one of
the things that you can

228
00:10:53.060 --> 00:10:55.760
control is the density of
the shape you're presenting that

229
00:10:55.760 --> 00:10:58.520
you're making. And so you
build out these density accused

230
00:10:58.520 --> 00:11:00.530
with different densities and you
can drop them in a

231
00:11:00.530 --> 00:11:03.230
pool of water. And so
showing a kid that, you

232
00:11:03.230 --> 00:11:05.030
know, things that are more
dense or will sink and

233
00:11:05.030 --> 00:11:08.840
things that don't arise is
critical. We also have scenarios

234
00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:10.520
of this Teeter totter. And
I use this on my

235
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:12.350
kids. You mentioned you have
a young son. So I

236
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.890
have seven year old twins,
a boy and girl, and

237
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:19.070
they always say things like,
you know, it's a thousand

238
00:11:19.070 --> 00:11:22.730
percent. So they understand magnitude,
but not really kind of,

239
00:11:22.910 --> 00:11:25.070
you know what it really
means like a hundred versus

240
00:11:25.070 --> 00:11:26.870
a million. They didn't really
know the difference. So one

241
00:11:26.870 --> 00:11:29.510
of the kids that we
have is a weight at

242
00:11:29.510 --> 00:11:32.690
scale. So you print this
scale out and you can

243
00:11:32.690 --> 00:11:35.300
print out these little squares
at different densities. And the

244
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:38.150
squares can be things like
let's say coins is one

245
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.310
example. So it has a
dollar piece, a nickel piece

246
00:11:40.310 --> 00:11:43.040
of dime piece. And as
you stack them on the

247
00:11:43.050 --> 00:11:46.130
scale, it balances itself. So
I was able to take

248
00:11:46.130 --> 00:11:48.140
that particular kit home for
dinner one day and just

249
00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:50.210
give my kids these things.
And I didn't even explain

250
00:11:50.210 --> 00:11:52.460
what I was doing. And
by the time we finished

251
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:55.360
dinner, they knew four quarters
equals $1, and they were

252
00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.280
able to make those kinds
of determinations of justice by

253
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:00.380
simply playing with plastics, you
know, and it's something that

254
00:12:00.390 --> 00:12:03.130
I've been trying forever figuring
out forever how to explain

255
00:12:03.130 --> 00:12:04.810
that. And I couldn't. And
so these kids said able,

256
00:12:04.810 --> 00:12:06.370
things like that, and it's,
so it's exciting when you

257
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:08.500
get in the classroom, you
see a kid at a

258
00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:10.900
conference playing with it or
in a classroom playing with

259
00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.760
it, and you can see
how man his printer was,

260
00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:16.060
was simply before just a
random thing now has become

261
00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:18.430
a supply factory that really
can cane and change people's

262
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:22.490
perceptions on education. So let's,
let's back up and partial

263
00:12:22.500 --> 00:12:26.370
word that you've been throwing
around. Like, it's obvious because

264
00:12:26.370 --> 00:12:30.630
this is your business. You
said, manipulatives, what are you

265
00:12:30.630 --> 00:12:33.180
manipulative? That makes me feel
like it's the stuff that

266
00:12:33.180 --> 00:12:35.790
you touch and feel. And
that's when, when the learning,

267
00:12:36.420 --> 00:12:39.180
Yeah, manipulative would be an
asset or an object that

268
00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.760
you're using in the classroom
to aid in instruction. So

269
00:12:42.480 --> 00:12:45.420
a ruler, right? If you're
teaching how to measure length

270
00:12:45.420 --> 00:12:48.690
and precision, the ruler itself
will be the manipulative. And

271
00:12:48.690 --> 00:12:51.210
so in our case, if
you look through the, my

272
00:12:51.210 --> 00:12:56.100
STEM kits portfolio of projects,
we're building things like catapults,

273
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:01.560
rocket lunchers DNA kits, the
scales were building cars. So

274
00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:04.680
all of these are assets
that a teacher, typically, as

275
00:13:04.680 --> 00:13:06.660
you've mentioned, we'll be doing
in the classroom. So you

276
00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.630
mentioned the potential energy scenario
as well. Through that example,

277
00:13:09.630 --> 00:13:12.000
when I was in school,
you had this sign, you

278
00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:13.890
saw the sign wave type
of thing. And it was

279
00:13:13.890 --> 00:13:15.060
like, we you're at the
top. You're at your highest

280
00:13:15.060 --> 00:13:17.100
potential. When you wrapped at
the bottom, you lost potential.

281
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.860
And you're trying to explain
this abstract concept. And let's

282
00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:21.900
fast forward that back to
how my STEM kids would

283
00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.320
approach that. We realized that
in most classrooms, that when

284
00:13:25.320 --> 00:13:27.570
they're trying to buy ramp
kits, they're very expensive. On

285
00:13:27.570 --> 00:13:31.020
average schools are spending 150,
$200 plus to go out

286
00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:33.390
and buy a kit just
to do one particular experiment.

287
00:13:33.750 --> 00:13:35.280
So in our case, we
said, well, great. Let's go

288
00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.080
and design a ramp kit
where we're going to use

289
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:39.990
pencils and rulers. So we
produced it three D printed

290
00:13:39.990 --> 00:13:43.530
parts that you print out
and you combine these with

291
00:13:43.530 --> 00:13:46.350
the pencils and rulers to
make a ramp you're manipulative.

292
00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:49.080
And now you're trying to
teach kids well, potential and

293
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.270
kinetic energy. So we do
is we have a car

294
00:13:51.870 --> 00:13:55.110
and then one of our
partners is a company called

295
00:13:55.230 --> 00:13:58.200
science, which manufacturer sensors. So
we take this car and

296
00:13:58.200 --> 00:14:00.060
we put a force and
motion sensor on it. So

297
00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:03.060
this is an IOT Bluetooth
device where you can put

298
00:14:03.060 --> 00:14:05.820
it on the cart, run
an experiment. And in real

299
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:10.200
time via an app, you're
able to collect data. The

300
00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:14.250
data includes the position, the
velocity acceleration, and then dependent

301
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:15.990
upon where you are, whether
you're a younger kid or

302
00:14:15.990 --> 00:14:19.040
an older kid, you can
take real time data and

303
00:14:19.080 --> 00:14:21.600
be able to explain that
phenomenon. So instead of going

304
00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.700
and drawing it graph and
chart and trying to make

305
00:14:23.700 --> 00:14:25.950
this abstract notion catch with
a kid who maybe is

306
00:14:25.950 --> 00:14:29.820
not interested, they're out in
the classroom using real, using

307
00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.460
their hands with these manipulatives
to get that concept. And

308
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:35.010
I think that that's the
difference that taking these abstract

309
00:14:35.010 --> 00:14:38.010
concepts, making them very hands
on and engaging, I think

310
00:14:38.010 --> 00:14:42.720
is what model motivates this,
these, this challenge generation. And

311
00:14:42.720 --> 00:14:44.850
I think that the, one
of the root and things

312
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:48.120
I'm hearing when we talk
about next generation STEM is

313
00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:52.760
also that the technology may
be in the, it may

314
00:14:52.760 --> 00:14:55.070
just be in different sections
of the room, the Arduino,

315
00:14:55.070 --> 00:14:56.960
or the sensor, or the
IOT device that they were

316
00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:00.500
given is in a drawer
somewhere on used, you know,

317
00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.900
the three D printer was
fun for a week or

318
00:15:02.900 --> 00:15:04.730
two. We couldn't figure out
what to print. We couldn't

319
00:15:04.730 --> 00:15:07.910
get prints. So it's in
the corner on used, you

320
00:15:07.910 --> 00:15:11.840
know, or everyone has an
iPhone or an Android phone,

321
00:15:12.650 --> 00:15:14.420
but you know, other than
some apps, what are we

322
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:18.680
using for it? Another great
example is that you made

323
00:15:18.680 --> 00:15:23.120
a microscope phone adapter, right?
So you've got a microscope

324
00:15:23.120 --> 00:15:25.310
in the green, in the
classroom. Everyone's got an iPhone

325
00:15:26.060 --> 00:15:29.090
and with some rubber bands
and some really clever three

326
00:15:29.090 --> 00:15:31.310
D printed parts that are
all part of this, this

327
00:15:31.310 --> 00:15:35.390
kit now you've, you've basically
jacked your iPhone into the

328
00:15:35.390 --> 00:15:39.590
microscope. And now you're taking
video of what's happening on

329
00:15:39.590 --> 00:15:43.370
cells on the, you know,
live right there. But you,

330
00:15:43.430 --> 00:15:46.280
but you're not doing it
with an expensive adapter or

331
00:15:46.280 --> 00:15:48.650
some thing that you bought.
That's just for that skill,

332
00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.940
right? You printed that plastic
out yourself. And I think

333
00:15:51.940 --> 00:15:53.770
people take that for granted.
What most people don't realize

334
00:15:53.770 --> 00:15:56.470
is that unless you have
an educator and your family,

335
00:15:56.830 --> 00:15:59.650
is that a lot of
those things you're mentioning are

336
00:15:59.800 --> 00:16:02.410
they're part of your supply
budget. And oftentimes the teachers,

337
00:16:02.410 --> 00:16:04.540
the personnel, making those things
happen. They're the one running

338
00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:06.610
around the hobby lobby and
different places trying to buy

339
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:10.240
stuff to do things right.
And so being able to

340
00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:14.110
have that resource available, but
it goes a step father,

341
00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.570
how do you know how
to sequence that? And they

342
00:16:16.570 --> 00:16:18.400
can find it when they
need it. And I think

343
00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.320
a lot of people kind
of get confused in this

344
00:16:20.380 --> 00:16:22.450
internet age, where we're so
used to going out and

345
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.880
tapping into our nearest browser.
I would never start changing

346
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.480
a keyword and finding a
result, but there's a lot

347
00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.040
of mess out there and
a lot of stuff that's,

348
00:16:30.130 --> 00:16:33.520
that's available. And so being
able to filter and index

349
00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.340
these different tools, present them
back when they're needed, and

350
00:16:36.340 --> 00:16:38.220
then making it easy for
those teachers to produce it

351
00:16:38.220 --> 00:16:40.210
and get access to it
is also a part of

352
00:16:40.210 --> 00:16:43.020
that. And the other piece
that is important as well

353
00:16:43.030 --> 00:16:45.190
as the professional development, because
as you mentioned, I was

354
00:16:45.190 --> 00:16:47.590
in a school last week
here in Atlanta, and it

355
00:16:47.590 --> 00:16:49.870
was a local STEM coordinator.
And I walked into the

356
00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:52.420
room and I saw every
robot. You can imagine every

357
00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:55.630
piece of hardware you can
imagine. And every, it was,

358
00:16:55.630 --> 00:16:58.090
it was crazy. It must've
been in that room, smart

359
00:16:58.090 --> 00:17:01.750
bores. And it probably was
$300,000 of stuff in that

360
00:17:01.750 --> 00:17:05.110
room, but that, but as
they're showing our solution than

361
00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.300
what it did, and they
saw value in it, and

362
00:17:07.390 --> 00:17:10.030
almost to the point to
where we asked a question

363
00:17:10.030 --> 00:17:11.680
and we talked about how
a lot of times different

364
00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:13.820
schools and people just buy
stuff because it was in

365
00:17:13.820 --> 00:17:16.540
a catalog somewhere. And the
teacher raised their hand, said,

366
00:17:16.540 --> 00:17:19.210
I'm guilty of that. They're
buying what they're being presented

367
00:17:19.240 --> 00:17:21.880
by people who market it
best, but nobody's making it

368
00:17:21.910 --> 00:17:23.650
integrate it so that people
can really use it and

369
00:17:23.650 --> 00:17:25.660
add value. And that's a
really big problem in industry

370
00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:28.570
right now. And in particular
in education. Yeah. You know,

371
00:17:29.540 --> 00:17:32.650
I'm Like that those schools
exist, right? Like for every

372
00:17:32.650 --> 00:17:35.770
school that has, you know,
hundreds of thousands of dollars

373
00:17:35.770 --> 00:17:40.330
of stuff like that. There's
other schools like mine that

374
00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.160
are, that are we're on,
you know, 70% of the

375
00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.490
local budget and we're, you
know, run by volunteers. Yeah.

376
00:17:46.030 --> 00:17:47.500
Yes. I haven't had an
answer. I used to think

377
00:17:47.500 --> 00:17:49.650
as well. I used to
think so to, it comes

378
00:17:49.650 --> 00:17:51.630
in two falls. We, and
that's a real part of

379
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:54.090
what we focus on as
well. Is that in one

380
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:55.710
sense, it's like they have
not. So we don't have

381
00:17:55.710 --> 00:17:58.200
access to resources, but on
the other side is the

382
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.290
people who have resources, but
they're underexposed. And so being

383
00:18:01.290 --> 00:18:03.840
able to pull these things
together in a coherent way

384
00:18:03.840 --> 00:18:07.830
that they understand and making
a technology seamless is also

385
00:18:07.830 --> 00:18:09.120
a big piece of what
it's going to take to

386
00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.200
be able to get this
stuff out there to the

387
00:18:10.200 --> 00:18:13.190
masses. So the key is
truly can benefit One of

388
00:18:13.190 --> 00:18:16.160
the things that I've found
from a creativity perspective that

389
00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.530
is really impressive about the
design of the different 3d

390
00:18:18.530 --> 00:18:20.750
things that you're doing helped
me be a better three

391
00:18:20.750 --> 00:18:23.270
D printer was, and this
is going to sound obvious,

392
00:18:23.270 --> 00:18:27.320
but the reminder that the
thing that you're building, doesn't

393
00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:28.970
just have to be made
out of three D printed

394
00:18:28.970 --> 00:18:32.450
parts. Like for example, a
catapult, you shouldn't build that

395
00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.550
with only stuff you can
print. You're going to hit

396
00:18:34.550 --> 00:18:37.130
a wall really quickly. And
while it might seem obvious

397
00:18:37.130 --> 00:18:39.830
to you to like add
rubber bands or add a

398
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:43.370
coin or some ball bearings
or whatever, it took me

399
00:18:43.370 --> 00:18:45.920
probably six months of three
D printing before I realized

400
00:18:45.920 --> 00:18:48.020
that I could go and
just take some screws from

401
00:18:48.020 --> 00:18:51.140
home Depot and screw them
into the thing. And then

402
00:18:51.350 --> 00:18:53.540
things got interesting. And that
was the whole point though,

403
00:18:53.540 --> 00:18:56.450
the entire point of my
STEM kiss was leveraging stuff

404
00:18:56.450 --> 00:18:59.510
in the classroom to enable
more stuff. Right. So we

405
00:18:59.510 --> 00:19:02.150
built out, we have an
example of this, like science

406
00:19:02.150 --> 00:19:05.690
experimenters kit. It does things
like, you know, you have,

407
00:19:05.690 --> 00:19:07.160
you seen a set up
where you have like the,

408
00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:10.430
the light flashing, you measuring
temperature over distance, and you

409
00:19:10.430 --> 00:19:12.410
have three or four different
test tubes where you're measuring

410
00:19:12.410 --> 00:19:15.950
different liquids. Like those apparatus,
again, you may go and

411
00:19:15.950 --> 00:19:18.710
spend in a science, a
typical science catalog, you know,

412
00:19:19.010 --> 00:19:21.860
thousand dollars. And so you
take five rulers, a couple

413
00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:24.020
of pencils and some common
stuff, and you have this

414
00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.050
thing done with $5 in
plastics. And so that's a

415
00:19:27.050 --> 00:19:29.690
really, so having teachers in
the classroom, normally they have

416
00:19:29.690 --> 00:19:32.300
access to and thinking about
how you can take that

417
00:19:32.300 --> 00:19:34.040
and make it something greater.
Like a sum of the

418
00:19:34.050 --> 00:19:37.140
parts is truly, you know,
a big hole as is

419
00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:38.480
a big focus of what
we're doing now. So people

420
00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.480
get very excited by that.
Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I've

421
00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:44.360
got a dry one. I
have a dremmel brand printer.

422
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.520
I've found that to be
a real workhorse. Like I've

423
00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:47.780
got a couple of the
three D printers, but the

424
00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:50.450
dremmel just worked. No, we
love drum. We'll actually, that's

425
00:19:50.450 --> 00:19:53.840
one of our strategic partners.
So dremmel currently when you

426
00:19:53.930 --> 00:19:57.950
purchased their education skewed printer,
it actually comes bundled with

427
00:19:57.950 --> 00:20:02.210
10 of the, my STEM
kits kits directly on the

428
00:20:02.210 --> 00:20:05.000
SD card. And we're soon
to roll out a new

429
00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:08.270
printer. They'll be an education
skewed focused printer to where,

430
00:20:08.600 --> 00:20:11.000
when you get that particular
printer, it'll come bundled with

431
00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.370
four months of my STEM
kits. So we, we like

432
00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.230
to rumble and we focus
in on those guys. One

433
00:20:15.230 --> 00:20:17.810
because the quality it works,
it works very well to,

434
00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:20.840
for the class. And for
the size of printer they

435
00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:22.760
have is actually one of
the best values you'll find

436
00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:25.040
in the market. And so
we really wanted to find

437
00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:27.050
something that you could go
into a school that was

438
00:20:27.050 --> 00:20:30.410
enclosed. That just works. And
more importantly, if there's an

439
00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.690
issue you can call one
800, give me help. And

440
00:20:32.690 --> 00:20:34.880
somebody answers a phone. So
we like those guys in

441
00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:37.940
there. They're one of our
procedure partners. Yeah. I actually

442
00:20:38.210 --> 00:20:40.160
funded, this is a true
story. And again, like, we're

443
00:20:40.190 --> 00:20:41.960
sounding like we're gushing, but
we are because when you

444
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.610
find a good product, you
got a little bit, you

445
00:20:43.610 --> 00:20:47.200
know, I got the dremmel
and then one day I

446
00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:49.000
stepped away from a little
while and it got, it

447
00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:52.120
got kinda crooked because it
got a clog. So I

448
00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.640
called support and, you know,
I had low expectations of

449
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.740
support, you know what I
mean? I have, I generally

450
00:20:56.740 --> 00:21:01.240
have low expectations and I
could hear something in the

451
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:05.320
background. The, the person on
the support was printing. Interesting.

452
00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.660
So I just figured it
would be somebody reading from

453
00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.440
a script. Right. But the
individual not only was printing,

454
00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:13.930
but actually knew the number
of thousands of hours that

455
00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:16.120
they had in printing experience.
So he's like, Oh no,

456
00:21:16.120 --> 00:21:20.620
I've been printing for like
1,850 hours. So this person

457
00:21:20.620 --> 00:21:23.860
helped me disassemble the head
of the, of the dremmel

458
00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.350
and unclog it and then
reassemble it. And it was

459
00:21:26.350 --> 00:21:28.120
not nearly as hard as
I thought, but it was

460
00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:29.890
such a joy to talk
to someone on support that

461
00:21:29.890 --> 00:21:32.710
actually was using the product,
which I thought was kind

462
00:21:32.710 --> 00:21:34.650
of cool. Yeah. And that's
really important for education man.

463
00:21:34.650 --> 00:21:36.990
Cause people will be surprised
for some of the leaders

464
00:21:36.990 --> 00:21:39.210
in the market. The model
hidden pass has been women.

465
00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:42.300
When schools buy printers, they
don't even come with support

466
00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.900
supporters like an add on
and more. And even some

467
00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:48.150
of the major printers that
were there were being sold

468
00:21:48.150 --> 00:21:50.790
to schools, mandate added a
box. And in some cases

469
00:21:50.790 --> 00:21:54.240
have like, you know, 30,
40% failure rates. And so

470
00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:56.430
what happens in that case
is that even with a

471
00:21:56.430 --> 00:21:58.650
product like ours, which we
believe kind of enables an

472
00:21:58.770 --> 00:22:01.680
entire wave of innovation, people
start to get this disdain

473
00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:04.340
on the industry. And so
is holding, you know, holding

474
00:22:04.350 --> 00:22:06.960
back innovation. So yeah, definitely.
We're excited about those guys

475
00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.150
and we hope that in
our case that we can

476
00:22:09.150 --> 00:22:11.400
continue to add content over
time. As an example, we

477
00:22:11.400 --> 00:22:14.670
pushed out, I think this
past month alone, we pushed

478
00:22:14.670 --> 00:22:17.970
out an additional 40 kits
and there are another 30

479
00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.090
or 40 in the backlog.
And outside of that curriculum,

480
00:22:21.090 --> 00:22:23.790
it's being written every day.
So we hope that if

481
00:22:23.790 --> 00:22:25.770
you are out there now,
when you think the library

482
00:22:25.770 --> 00:22:28.080
is amazing, you know, just
continue to check and it'll

483
00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:29.580
continue to grow and grow
and add more value over

484
00:22:29.580 --> 00:22:33.780
time. So we've gushed about
three D printers and you

485
00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:36.660
touched a little bit on
sensors, but I know that,

486
00:22:37.050 --> 00:22:39.510
that we both feel that
there's a lot of hardware

487
00:22:39.510 --> 00:22:42.120
that is in drawers. There's
a lot of Arduinos that

488
00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:44.310
have had LEDs blink, and
then they've been put away,

489
00:22:45.150 --> 00:22:48.090
you know, how do we
go from the, the abstract

490
00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:50.520
to the, you know, the,
the kinesthetic to the physical

491
00:22:50.520 --> 00:22:52.680
and may and put these
things to work. Yeah. We

492
00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:55.740
start in that again, my
background is electrical engineering and,

493
00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.500
you know, being hands on
your lap, like your son

494
00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:00.810
with that example of things,
Blinken has always been intriguing

495
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:03.810
to me. And so we've
spoken on that as well.

496
00:23:03.810 --> 00:23:07.590
So if you take a
look at mantis, open stem.com,

497
00:23:07.590 --> 00:23:12.000
mantis like the spider OPN,
S T m.com there, you'll

498
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.570
see one of our strategic
partners we work with. And

499
00:23:15.630 --> 00:23:17.280
the idea here was that,
how do you create an

500
00:23:17.310 --> 00:23:23.370
ecosystem of, again, open, engaged,
and accessible sensors that allow

501
00:23:23.370 --> 00:23:25.770
for people to get engaged?
So out there, as an

502
00:23:25.770 --> 00:23:29.250
example, one of my STEM
kits kits is imagine you're

503
00:23:29.250 --> 00:23:33.510
trying to teach kids about
light intensity, right? So there's

504
00:23:33.510 --> 00:23:35.640
a, my STEM kits kit
that uses pencils and rulers

505
00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:38.820
to build his temperature tower.
And what happens is that

506
00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:41.400
on a temperature tower, they
Mount one of the senses,

507
00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:43.470
which is a climate sensor.
And this sensor is able

508
00:23:43.470 --> 00:23:47.540
to measure things like light,
intensity, humidity, barometric pressure, et

509
00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:50.990
cetera. And they're all wireless
sensors. So in one example,

510
00:23:50.990 --> 00:23:53.180
the kid has a cell
phone. Again, like you said

511
00:23:53.180 --> 00:23:55.460
earlier, that's already in the
classroom. They have a piece

512
00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:58.130
of paper and they shine
light from the cell phone

513
00:23:58.130 --> 00:24:00.230
through the paper. And what
we do is that you

514
00:24:00.230 --> 00:24:02.570
change out that dead material.
And you're able to show

515
00:24:02.570 --> 00:24:05.360
key is in real time
through an app that different

516
00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:09.020
surfaces have different intensities or
they reflect different amounts of

517
00:24:09.020 --> 00:24:12.620
light. And so again, taking
common classroom things, bringing it

518
00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:14.450
out T space into it
to make an open and

519
00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.890
engaging is interesting. There we
also, one of the projects

520
00:24:18.890 --> 00:24:22.490
I'm very excited about right
now is that you're familiar

521
00:24:22.490 --> 00:24:25.060
with scratch I'm swimming, right?
Yeah. Actually, my son is

522
00:24:25.060 --> 00:24:27.700
working on a scratch game
right now. Pretty abstract though.

523
00:24:27.700 --> 00:24:31.140
It's all just on the
screen. Exactly. So huge ecosystems

524
00:24:31.140 --> 00:24:33.220
like the guys at MIT
and that ecosystem is very

525
00:24:33.220 --> 00:24:35.860
nice. And a lot of
people of late have come

526
00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:38.290
out and started to put
in sensors that tie into

527
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:41.230
it. So, you know, Lego's
you name it. You can

528
00:24:41.230 --> 00:24:43.660
go in and connect with
those things. The challenge is

529
00:24:43.660 --> 00:24:46.540
that though, in most cases,
all you're doing is going

530
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:48.490
in connecting this and go
forward and go back. It's

531
00:24:48.490 --> 00:24:51.430
not really again, tap education.
So one of the projects

532
00:24:51.430 --> 00:24:54.190
that we're doing today in
that is that we're launching

533
00:24:54.310 --> 00:24:57.100
a version of scratch, which
is based on the current

534
00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:01.150
framework where it will actually
be able to connect to

535
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.700
each of the sensors that
are in the framework, but

536
00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:06.580
not just one on one
actual at the same time,

537
00:25:07.330 --> 00:25:11.020
but we're building out with
our partnership at FSU curriculum.

538
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:14.500
And that curriculum is tied
focus on the fourth to

539
00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:17.650
the kind of eighth grade,
middle school kind of group.

540
00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:21.280
And it'll teach you scratch.
It'll teach you computer science

541
00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.190
and also teach you to
standards, but it'll use scratch

542
00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:27.370
as interface to make that
happen. And so, and then

543
00:25:27.370 --> 00:25:29.440
beyond that, for people who
are in high school and

544
00:25:29.440 --> 00:25:33.100
beyond those same sensors, then
also have open API APIs

545
00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.930
where kids are learning how
to do things like unity.

546
00:25:34.930 --> 00:25:37.390
So I've been, I don't
play games a lot, but

547
00:25:37.390 --> 00:25:40.090
I'm very intrigued by gaming.
And so we have interns

548
00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.820
in the office now where
they're writing apps that are

549
00:25:43.060 --> 00:25:46.180
leveraging and taking Bluetooth and
IOT data and using things

550
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:48.820
like unity to write, to
write apps. So how do

551
00:25:48.820 --> 00:25:50.200
you meet people where they
are and take them where

552
00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:51.490
they want to go? So
if a person is an

553
00:25:51.490 --> 00:25:54.340
Android developer and his job
is to hit Java SDK,

554
00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:56.410
or somebody likes to write
in Microsoft, here's what you

555
00:25:56.410 --> 00:25:58.930
need to go and make
a windows universal app. But

556
00:25:58.930 --> 00:26:02.320
everything in that space needs
to be again, aligned back

557
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.420
to their standards. So these
teachers and schools can embrace

558
00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:06.400
that. And that's a really
big focus of what we're

559
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:11.110
doing. It seems like having
the, you know, these open

560
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.540
standards and have it be
kind of late the new

561
00:26:13.540 --> 00:26:16.150
IOT Lego pieces. I always
love to use Legos is

562
00:26:16.150 --> 00:26:19.150
that you don't want to
be locked into a platform.

563
00:26:19.330 --> 00:26:21.130
You wanna be able to
talk to things over Bluetooth

564
00:26:21.130 --> 00:26:24.940
or USB in a way
that is interchangeable. Yeah. Yeah.

565
00:26:24.940 --> 00:26:26.740
So that, I think that's
critical is the most of

566
00:26:26.740 --> 00:26:30.250
the devices out there now
in the IOT space and

567
00:26:30.250 --> 00:26:33.880
in the classrooms are typically
then not Bluetooth, the legacy

568
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:37.030
of Bluetooth or proprietary frameworks.
You could see a wave

569
00:26:37.030 --> 00:26:38.710
of new devices that are
starting to come on, come

570
00:26:38.710 --> 00:26:42.070
online now. But a lot
of people are really haven't

571
00:26:42.070 --> 00:26:43.950
been giving schools the access.
So that's an example of

572
00:26:43.950 --> 00:26:46.320
one of the major, what
they call program companies in

573
00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:48.540
the market today, I was
working with a school a

574
00:26:48.540 --> 00:26:50.970
couple of years ago. And
when you bought their product,

575
00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:52.620
if you want it to
go in their app as

576
00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:54.450
an example, and it puts
your own curriculum in it,

577
00:26:54.720 --> 00:26:56.250
you have to pay them
for that. And they were

578
00:26:56.250 --> 00:26:58.140
literally give you a PowerPoint
file and you have to

579
00:26:58.140 --> 00:26:59.820
go and change a few
words out. And they would

580
00:26:59.970 --> 00:27:02.700
basically take that curriculum, put
it aside of their app.

581
00:27:02.700 --> 00:27:04.680
And that's how you got
exposed to it. And so

582
00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:06.890
you're really locked into it.
And there were no API

583
00:27:06.890 --> 00:27:09.030
APIs to get your data.
You can extend it. So

584
00:27:09.030 --> 00:27:10.770
what they did, they have
a very nice sensor that

585
00:27:10.770 --> 00:27:12.840
can give you some data.
The kid has an app

586
00:27:12.840 --> 00:27:14.640
in their hand. They can
see the value change and

587
00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:16.980
they can hit save. But
since there wasn't an open

588
00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.620
standard, you couldn't take the
temperature sensor and the climate

589
00:27:19.620 --> 00:27:21.600
sensor and go combine it
in your own app to

590
00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:24.330
go make something for hydroponics.
So you limited the use

591
00:27:24.330 --> 00:27:26.550
case based on what they
wanted to expose because they

592
00:27:26.550 --> 00:27:29.190
didn't want their ecosystem was
very close. And I think

593
00:27:29.190 --> 00:27:33.210
that's a really big problem.
That's really stunting innovation and

594
00:27:33.210 --> 00:27:34.590
allow people to kind of
go where they want to

595
00:27:34.590 --> 00:27:37.980
go with it. And so
making an open, accessible, engaging,

596
00:27:38.070 --> 00:27:41.010
and thirdly taking the cost
out of it, there is

597
00:27:41.010 --> 00:27:44.210
no reason why it should
cost somebody, you know, a

598
00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.530
hundred dollars about a temperature
probe. That's not even digital.

599
00:27:47.340 --> 00:27:49.950
And, and that's that, that's
a really big pain point

600
00:27:49.950 --> 00:27:53.000
for me as well. How
do you, you're an entrepreneur

601
00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.100
though. You presumably want to
make business. How do you

602
00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.460
make things open and then
also make money? I think

603
00:27:58.460 --> 00:28:01.250
it's very simple, man. So
I always think about, and

604
00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:03.500
you would relate to this,
like you think about domain

605
00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.930
names back in the day,
right? You had to go

606
00:28:05.930 --> 00:28:08.330
to somewhere like register.com and
buy a domain name. And

607
00:28:08.330 --> 00:28:10.760
it was very expensive. And
then this GoDaddy company comes

608
00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:12.770
along and kind of cuts
the cost and everybody uses

609
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:14.900
them. Right. So I think
that if you found a

610
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:17.390
way to spread it out
to the masses, there's a

611
00:28:17.390 --> 00:28:19.250
way to kind of make
it happen. Because particularly if

612
00:28:19.250 --> 00:28:21.650
you look at hardware, one
of the driving costs for

613
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.350
hardware is the scale at
which you produce it. Right?

614
00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.310
And so finding ways to
extend the use cases and

615
00:28:28.310 --> 00:28:30.500
to broaden that ecosystem helps
you kind of keep those

616
00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:32.810
costs down. And also there
are a lot of other

617
00:28:32.810 --> 00:28:35.060
value added things that come
with that. So for instance,

618
00:28:35.090 --> 00:28:37.370
if you look at schools
today, a lot of schools

619
00:28:37.370 --> 00:28:40.670
or States have adopted laws
now where schools are moving

620
00:28:40.670 --> 00:28:43.640
away from ditch, from actual
physical textbooks. And so they're

621
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:47.750
moving toward digital, some schools,
there's some open standards, textbook

622
00:28:47.760 --> 00:28:50.000
standards where you can produce
digital textbooks. So some school

623
00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:52.250
districts actually go out and
they come back and on

624
00:28:52.250 --> 00:28:54.830
these resources and make digital
textbooks. And so if you

625
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.920
have an ecosystem that's out
there, that's relevant that people

626
00:28:57.920 --> 00:29:01.040
are connected with. Then there
are ways to look at

627
00:29:01.040 --> 00:29:04.430
content to make it happen,
or more importantly, a lot

628
00:29:04.430 --> 00:29:07.040
of device companies, or a
lot of major technology companies

629
00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:11.150
like devices. You mentioned Bluetooth,
a Bluetooth device has to

630
00:29:11.150 --> 00:29:14.570
connect to a computer, a
tablet or something else. I

631
00:29:14.570 --> 00:29:16.880
believe there's a unique opportunity
to connect with companies who

632
00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.300
are focused on STEM or
education to put together bundles

633
00:29:20.300 --> 00:29:23.150
and scenarios to where you
package these things together and

634
00:29:23.150 --> 00:29:25.610
make it happen a few
years ago. Well, yeah, maybe

635
00:29:25.610 --> 00:29:27.920
a couple of years back,
there was cases out in

636
00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:30.830
California where the districts invested
a lot of money and

637
00:29:31.070 --> 00:29:34.160
iPads, right. And that program
had a couple of issues.

638
00:29:34.520 --> 00:29:37.550
But imagine if they were
to have bundle an iPad

639
00:29:37.580 --> 00:29:40.970
with a sensor suite that
was useful across the entire

640
00:29:40.990 --> 00:29:43.840
district, but also relevant to
the standards. So I think

641
00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:45.850
it wasn't creative packaging and
the right partners. There's a

642
00:29:45.850 --> 00:29:47.560
way to make it happen
and have it women everywhere.

643
00:29:48.550 --> 00:29:54.520
Very cool. So if someone
has a, has a school

644
00:29:54.520 --> 00:29:57.910
or a private school or
homeschool, let's say a homeschool

645
00:29:57.910 --> 00:30:01.120
are these kinds of things
inaccessible to them financially, but

646
00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:03.400
or not. So in particular,
in the case of the,

647
00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.740
my STEM kits business, there
actually are two models. And

648
00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:09.190
there was one built for
homeschools where there's an enterprise

649
00:30:09.190 --> 00:30:12.640
model naturally where a school
district can go and subscribe

650
00:30:12.640 --> 00:30:14.380
based on the number of
kids in a class or

651
00:30:14.380 --> 00:30:18.640
a classroom set. But on
the consumer side, we actually

652
00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.710
treated it like the models
that a lot of the

653
00:30:20.710 --> 00:30:24.130
royalty image websites kind of
do where our kids have

654
00:30:24.130 --> 00:30:27.220
points, whether it's a basic
or an extended kit. And

655
00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:29.530
there are packages as low
as like a couple hundred

656
00:30:29.530 --> 00:30:33.220
dollars a year where you
can get in kind of

657
00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:35.530
get access to the library,
print out what you want

658
00:30:35.530 --> 00:30:38.800
on demand and be able
to get that curriculum. And

659
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:41.750
to your, to your question,
that also is a part

660
00:30:41.750 --> 00:30:44.260
of the business model. We
believe that just as we

661
00:30:44.260 --> 00:30:47.230
can be effective within schools,
that we can also become

662
00:30:47.590 --> 00:30:51.130
a resource for home schools,
private schools, after school programs

663
00:30:51.130 --> 00:30:54.070
and summer schools, I'll give
the example of my kids

664
00:30:54.070 --> 00:30:57.880
last summer. And we had,
we were looking for a

665
00:30:58.150 --> 00:31:02.830
really full, full summer full
lift summer program for six

666
00:31:02.830 --> 00:31:05.560
year olds that focused on
STEM and the most that

667
00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:07.720
we could find where these
little small one weeks in

668
00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.850
it programs that they could
go to, maybe some, a

669
00:31:09.850 --> 00:31:13.540
couple of weeks, they were
kinda not continuous. But the

670
00:31:13.540 --> 00:31:15.340
thing that got me the
most about that was I

671
00:31:15.340 --> 00:31:17.350
got my kids into a
program. They were very excited

672
00:31:17.350 --> 00:31:20.590
about it. They were learning
STEM based things, and my

673
00:31:20.590 --> 00:31:21.940
kid would come home. My
kids would come on the

674
00:31:21.940 --> 00:31:24.100
end of the day and
they would try to demonstrate

675
00:31:24.100 --> 00:31:25.690
to me what they had
learned in the camp that

676
00:31:25.690 --> 00:31:28.810
summer, that day, and when
they got home, everything they

677
00:31:28.810 --> 00:31:32.620
built was like, you know,
toilet paper, cardboard with some

678
00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:35.410
glue on it, with a
stick. And by the time

679
00:31:35.410 --> 00:31:38.380
they tried to show me
the example they broke. And

680
00:31:38.380 --> 00:31:41.950
so all of these organizations
are out there, engage with

681
00:31:41.950 --> 00:31:45.640
our kids and they're using
kind of lackluster resources. And

682
00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:47.830
I believe that in this,
my STEM kits use case,

683
00:31:47.830 --> 00:31:50.590
we can become their, their
tool set to leverage that

684
00:31:50.590 --> 00:31:53.470
gives them sturdy things that
are valuable to kind of

685
00:31:53.470 --> 00:31:56.220
prolong that experience. So that,
that again is something that

686
00:31:56.220 --> 00:31:59.020
I'm very excited about. Very
cool. Well, thanks so much

687
00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:01.450
for talking with me today.
I appreciate your time on,

688
00:32:01.450 --> 00:32:03.190
thank you for having me,
man. Anytime we can talk

689
00:32:03.190 --> 00:32:05.710
about stamina kids, it really
excites me. And I thank

690
00:32:05.710 --> 00:32:08.280
you for lending than a
year. I'm your community and

691
00:32:08.290 --> 00:32:10.480

doing is really much appreciated.

692
00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.420
Absolutely. And we'll be sure
to put links to all

693
00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.720
the things we talked about
in the show notes. This

694
00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:19.540
has been another episode of
Hanselminutes and we'll see you

695
00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:27.750
again. <inaudible>.
