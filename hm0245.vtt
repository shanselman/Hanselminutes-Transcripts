talks with John backdoor about

7
00:00:44.790 --> 00:00:50.460
moving from small companies to
large corporations. Hi, this is

8
00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:52.710
Scott Hanselman, and this is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

9
00:00:52.710 --> 00:00:54.420
And today I'm sitting down
with my good friend, John

10
00:00:54.420 --> 00:00:57.000
batt, Dorf in his home,
and John and I actually

11
00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.110
worked together in banking for
years and years. Did I,

12
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:03.570
did I hook you up
with the job he actually

13
00:01:03.570 --> 00:01:06.930
did. It was a kind
of a weird thing. I

14
00:01:06.930 --> 00:01:10.350
was leaving or working for
a small agency and you

15
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:13.830
know, it was rough economic
times and they said to

16
00:01:13.830 --> 00:01:16.230
me, one day, we're going
to let you go in

17
00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:19.620
a month. And I kind
of had already seen the

18
00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:22.200
writing on the wall. So
I'd been talking to you

19
00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:26.190
about finding a more stable
company. And the day that

20
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:28.380
I got laid off or
essentially told I was being

21
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:35.220
laid off, I got an
offer from which then got

22
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:39.000
bought by, which then got
bought by when I was,

23
00:01:40.470 --> 00:01:43.110
gosh, I started out there.
I want to say it

24
00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.390
was a couple of hundred
people by the time I

25
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:48.660
left, it was four or
500. Yeah, I think we

26
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:53.670
peaked around three 50 or
400 or so. What's it

27
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:56.640
like to go from a
company that's a couple hundred

28
00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:59.790
people to a couple of
tens of thousands of people?

29
00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.940
Well, what's funny is I've
always worked for small companies.

30
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.090
And when people listening to
this show here at small

31
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.490
companies, they probably think a
couple of hundred people, but

32
00:02:08.490 --> 00:02:12.180
I mean like 20 people,
small, like, like my day

33
00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.110
would be starting development. And
then, Oh my gosh, something

34
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.540
would happen to the servers
and the development would get

35
00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:20.340
put on a hold. And
even though we had a

36
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:24.170
system administrator, it was like,
the developers would get involved

37
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:27.570
in. And maybe even the
person that's like second in

38
00:02:27.570 --> 00:02:31.080
charge would be running in
to put their 2 cents in

39
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.500
and say what's going on.
But at a bigger company,

40
00:02:34.530 --> 00:02:38.400
even 300 people, which still
pretty small, it's not like

41
00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.460
that. And then when you
scale up to even bigger,

42
00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:44.670
it's less and less like
you're further removed from those

43
00:02:44.670 --> 00:02:48.480
kinds of things. Is that
because the bigger, the bigger

44
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:50.430
you get, the more people
there are to have a

45
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:54.270
specific job or anything like
of a small company, everyone

46
00:02:54.270 --> 00:02:57.510
owns everything. There's that notion
like an agile and agile

47
00:02:57.510 --> 00:03:00.430
methodology of collective ownership. Like
we all own The code.

48
00:03:00.430 --> 00:03:03.250
We all own the system.
And in a small company,

49
00:03:03.430 --> 00:03:06.250
you know, you have access
to the passwords on the

50
00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.050
production machine and you can
run in there and save

51
00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.190
it just as much as
the CTO can. Totally. And,

52
00:03:11.190 --> 00:03:15.360
and that's, that's like a
hard transition to make to

53
00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:21.030
when you leave that kind
of small entrepreneurial spirit, you

54
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:24.060
know, you can really affect
change, you know, about in

55
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:26.490
a small company, you know,
Oh, we're pitching this client.

56
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:29.790
And if our company gets
us, it means maybe it

57
00:03:29.790 --> 00:03:32.100
means new servers for everybody
or a new desktop machine

58
00:03:32.100 --> 00:03:35.910
or, or better benefits or,
or something really tangible to

59
00:03:35.910 --> 00:03:38.850
you. So you're really vested
to get it. But once

60
00:03:38.850 --> 00:03:42.150
you move to a bigger
company, you don't really it's

61
00:03:42.150 --> 00:03:44.790
like stuff just kind of
comes down to you. Oh,

62
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.500
you know, you're going to
be working on this project

63
00:03:46.500 --> 00:03:49.980
for the next six months.
And you don't really, I

64
00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:52.590
mean, press releases are kind
of like one of the

65
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:55.260
ways I hear about things
as bad as that sounds,

66
00:03:55.260 --> 00:03:57.360
but you know, it's not,
it's just the culture. It's

67
00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.100
just the way it is.
It's not necessarily a negative

68
00:03:59.100 --> 00:04:05.520
thing, but yeah, you don't
really, you're not exposed to

69
00:04:06.540 --> 00:04:09.660
things the way you are
in a smaller company. Before,

70
00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.820
before I worked at Microsoft,
I think I was like

71
00:04:11.820 --> 00:04:16.080
employee number 25, small what
I like to call boutique

72
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:20.370
consultancy. And what I liked
about that company so much

73
00:04:20.370 --> 00:04:22.740
was it was two guys
on the company and they

74
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:25.680
were 50 50 and we
would have company meetings and

75
00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:28.080
we'd go over the balance
sheet. Like, let me think

76
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.690
about that. Right. We would
have a company meeting and

77
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:33.510
you could literally everyone in
the company could basically know

78
00:04:33.510 --> 00:04:36.330
the finances and you'd say,
yeah, we just got, we

79
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.640
just got the Acme website
job and that's going to

80
00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.700
bring in $50,000 to the
company. And like you just

81
00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:43.650
said, and we'll all be
able to get new desks.

82
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.610
And it was totally visible.
So everything not just from,

83
00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:52.380
from development through testing to
production, but from the sales

84
00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:56.070
pipeline, like any employee could
log into the sales pipeline

85
00:04:56.070 --> 00:04:57.780
and see what was going
on. And we could see

86
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.400
that we really need to
get this to hit the

87
00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:02.550
rent this month, et cetera,
et cetera. I worked at

88
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:05.130
a place in Seattle. That
was probably, it was my

89
00:05:05.130 --> 00:05:07.620
first job out of college.
And it was a little

90
00:05:07.620 --> 00:05:12.780
tiny. I think 30 person
company called site works. They

91
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:16.230
were bought up by conglomerate
probably about three or four

92
00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:21.240
years after I worked there
or left. But day one

93
00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:24.870
was my first day was
all right, put your desk

94
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:29.370
together and build your computer.
And my desk was literally

95
00:05:29.370 --> 00:05:32.610
a door with four Ikea
legs and it was cool.

96
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:35.610
And there was no cubicles.
There was no walls. There

97
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:38.910
was dogs running around the
office. And one of the

98
00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:43.080
big things I remember was
when we got a really

99
00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:45.870
huge, it was on Microsoft,
I think windows, media, player

100
00:05:45.870 --> 00:05:48.660
account, or something, doing some
of the corporate marketing for

101
00:05:48.660 --> 00:05:51.810
them was that everybody got
air on chairs and that

102
00:05:51.810 --> 00:05:57.260
was like a huge deal.
So the other really funny

103
00:05:57.260 --> 00:06:00.950
thing about that company was
day one coming in, fresh

104
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:03.110
out of college. I mean,
I'd done some web development

105
00:06:03.110 --> 00:06:07.190
in college for the university
and for various offices at

106
00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.280
the university, they asked me
to sent me and this

107
00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.380
other guy down who I'm
actually still friends with. And

108
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.420
they said to me, looked
at me and said, which

109
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:16.350
project would you like to
work on? We have the

110
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:20.660
Warehouser corporate website or YouTube
world pop Mart to our

111
00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:26.520
website. That's a really hard
decision. Yeah. So When you

112
00:06:26.530 --> 00:06:29.410
describe the putting together of
the desk, I was over

113
00:06:29.410 --> 00:06:32.860
talking to Alex Payne who works
on thanks simple. And they're

114
00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:36.850
at a, an incubator downtown
Portland and incubator is basically

115
00:06:37.190 --> 00:06:40.150
a big warehouse where a
bunch of companies all go

116
00:06:40.150 --> 00:06:41.500
together. So like, if you
and I were going to

117
00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:44.200
go and spin off our
own company, we would call

118
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.150
them up and we'd say,
you know, get the hookup

119
00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.610
pay four or 500 bucks
a month. They give us

120
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:52.720
like a big wood door
and two saw horses. That's

121
00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.780
hilarious. And that would be
your desk. And I think

122
00:06:55.780 --> 00:06:59.290
that they do that, not
just because they're, they're trying

123
00:06:59.290 --> 00:07:02.770
to be, be inexpensive, but
there's just something about the

124
00:07:02.770 --> 00:07:06.370
legend of a startup. And
the two saw horses and

125
00:07:06.370 --> 00:07:10.090
the big door for a
desk that gets people like

126
00:07:10.120 --> 00:07:12.790
let's keep it fast and
lean and focus. You know

127
00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:15.910
what I mean? It's cool.
And it's, it's funny. Cause

128
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.910
I wouldn't have imagined that
would be the first thing

129
00:07:18.910 --> 00:07:22.330
I was doing at my
first job. But looking back

130
00:07:22.330 --> 00:07:24.970
over the years, that's probably
one of the favorite places

131
00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.230
that I've worked at over
the last 10, 15 years.

132
00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.170
I think it was, it
was, I, I think I

133
00:07:32.170 --> 00:07:35.020
was still at step around
nine. Let me see, what

134
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:38.500
is this? 2010. I want
to say 95, 96, we

135
00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:43.060
were working on this website
called eight hundred.com. I remember

136
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:47.530
that, Oh yeah. Eight hundred.com.
It was like pre, amazon.com.

137
00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:50.410
They were, they did this
deal once about three DVDs

138
00:07:50.410 --> 00:07:53.980
for a dollar and we
didn't actually have a space.

139
00:07:53.980 --> 00:07:56.620
So we were borrowing space
from someone else. And there

140
00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.360
was a time where some
of us were literally sitting

141
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.750
on the stairs because there
were no desks. So we

142
00:08:01.750 --> 00:08:04.810
had like, you know, walk
to the left because everyone's

143
00:08:04.810 --> 00:08:07.840
on the right side of
the staircase spiral staircase. And

144
00:08:07.840 --> 00:08:11.590
we're all just kind of
sitting there. Wow. And being,

145
00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:13.990
you know, using conference rooms
as war rooms, just because

146
00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:16.420
that's the only space that
you can have. One of

147
00:08:16.420 --> 00:08:18.940
the things that I've noticed
about a little company to

148
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.670
big company transitions is whether
or not you have control

149
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:27.700
of your own computer. Oh
yeah. That that's constantly a

150
00:08:27.940 --> 00:08:31.540
point of contention. That's a
very politically correct way of

151
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.640
putting it. So, So at
the company I work at

152
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:36.610
now, I mean the majority
of the company is still

153
00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:42.310
on XP. So yeah. There's
lots of people that would

154
00:08:42.310 --> 00:08:45.640
prefer to be on a
newer operating system and have

155
00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:50.890
newer software. But sometimes that's
kind of, one of the

156
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:53.170
things that you trade off
working for a big company

157
00:08:53.170 --> 00:08:57.540
is that the it people
who are completely awesome. And

158
00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:01.440
the two it guys we
have are probably the best

159
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:04.380
it guys I've worked with.
And it's not necessarily their

160
00:09:04.380 --> 00:09:08.490
decision, but as a company,
you know, they're, this is

161
00:09:08.490 --> 00:09:11.220
our direction. This is what
we're saying. And obviously I

162
00:09:11.220 --> 00:09:14.490
think they're, they're making strides
to move forward with that,

163
00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:18.030
but that kind of change
doesn't happen overnight. Whereas a

164
00:09:18.030 --> 00:09:22.050
small company it's like, you
can say, Hey, the beta

165
00:09:22.050 --> 00:09:24.110
for windows seven is out.
I put on my machine

166
00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:27.510
and the response would be,
yeah, but you're responding. If

167
00:09:27.510 --> 00:09:29.550
it doesn't work out, you've
got to put whatever else

168
00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:32.400
was back on there. And
if you're up til three

169
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.470
in the morning doing it,
that's kind of your deal.

170
00:09:34.910 --> 00:09:36.830
Yeah. I recognize that controls
have to be put in

171
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.450
place for, you know, corporate
governance and laws and Federalists

172
00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:44.480
and that. But I remember
that one of the most

173
00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:47.630
uncomfortable transitions between the small
boutique consultancy and what was

174
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.740
then called was that I
couldn't add a machine to

175
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.490
the domain without filling out
a form. So like if

176
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:57.230
I brought a machine in,
I would have to go

177
00:09:57.230 --> 00:09:59.780
and ask permission and I
have to get the it

178
00:09:59.780 --> 00:10:02.570
guy to walk over to
my desk as I'm, you

179
00:10:02.570 --> 00:10:05.270
know, installing windows and type
in his password. So he

180
00:10:05.270 --> 00:10:08.150
could add machines to the
domain. But it seems though

181
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:10.940
that there's a, there's kind
of this, this hump, if

182
00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.790
you imagine on the, on
the far left of a

183
00:10:13.790 --> 00:10:16.460
graph, you've got 20 people
in the room and you

184
00:10:16.460 --> 00:10:19.040
can point across the room
and see the domain controller

185
00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:22.040
you go like, yeah, that's
the server right there. And

186
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.690
then you, as you get
bigger and bigger, you can

187
00:10:23.690 --> 00:10:26.180
say, well, that closet is
where the servers are. Right.

188
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:27.470
And you get bigger and
bigger, then you say, well,

189
00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.200
that room is where the
servers are. At some point

190
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:32.660
you're like, I have no
idea where the server is,

191
00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.240
What it's even called. But
see, what's interesting is that

192
00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:38.180
you actually know your it
guys, like you've seen them.

193
00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:41.150
Yeah. I've worked at Microsoft
three years and I have

194
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:43.850
never seen an it guy.
Like I know that they're

195
00:10:43.850 --> 00:10:47.810
there. I've never seen one
in person, but I have

196
00:10:47.810 --> 00:10:50.750
the ability to add a
machine to the domain. So

197
00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:52.970
it's like, there's this, there's
this hump that you could

198
00:10:52.970 --> 00:10:55.820
over where it's like at
a certain size, maybe 500

199
00:10:55.820 --> 00:11:00.950
people. It's the most restrictive,
like they're super, super paranoid

200
00:11:00.950 --> 00:11:02.420
and they've grown up in
the only way that they

201
00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:04.400
know how. And the only
thing that they know how

202
00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:09.800
to do is increased control
by clamping down and allowing

203
00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:14.570
you to do effectively nothing.
Microsoft figures that their network

204
00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:18.170
infrastructures set up so well,
and there's not much damage

205
00:11:18.170 --> 00:11:22.130
you can do adding a
PC. What they've done is

206
00:11:22.130 --> 00:11:26.450
because they're so big, they,
they have scaled the automation.

207
00:11:26.930 --> 00:11:30.560
It's so incredibly automated that
they'll prevent you from hurting

208
00:11:30.560 --> 00:11:32.300
yourself. So for example, if
I add a machine to

209
00:11:32.310 --> 00:11:35.990
the domain right away, that
machine is controlled by the

210
00:11:35.990 --> 00:11:38.990
group policy, right? So, you
know, it has to, it

211
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:41.570
won't be allowed on the
internet without, or even on

212
00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:45.500
the intranet without all of
these appropriate firewalls and antivirus.

213
00:11:45.500 --> 00:11:49.880
So tools and things that
get pushed down automatically, you

214
00:11:49.880 --> 00:11:52.460
have constant kind of security
checks and compliance. It's so

215
00:11:52.460 --> 00:11:56.020
automated. It's actually automated so
well that it doesn't hurt

216
00:11:56.020 --> 00:11:58.450
so bad. Like it might
sound difficult. But I got

217
00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:01.060
an email actually a couple
of days ago that there's

218
00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.390
a patch for some Adobe
flash thing that I didn't

219
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:06.520
know, I didn't have on
one of my machines I'd

220
00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:11.020
forgotten about. So it's like,
it's very, very clean, formal

221
00:12:11.020 --> 00:12:13.690
email. You were the owner
of this machine and we

222
00:12:13.690 --> 00:12:15.760
have detected that you do
not have this patch. You

223
00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:17.980
have two days to install
this patch or we'll take

224
00:12:17.980 --> 00:12:21.070
you off the network. Oh,
wow. So it's the kind

225
00:12:21.070 --> 00:12:23.200
of email that you would
probably get from one of

226
00:12:23.200 --> 00:12:26.620
your two guys except it's
automated. So I think what

227
00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.770
happens is after four or
500 people, when things are

228
00:12:29.770 --> 00:12:32.410
out there, most restrictive, somebody
says we need to automate

229
00:12:32.410 --> 00:12:36.540
this. Right. And then things
become slightly less restrictive To

230
00:12:36.540 --> 00:12:38.940
alleviate all the work they
have to do to, to

231
00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:42.030
make those kinds of things
happen. Yeah, Exactly. So being

232
00:12:42.030 --> 00:12:44.340
able to add a machine,
you know, someone decided, I

233
00:12:44.340 --> 00:12:46.800
presume at Microsoft that being
able to add a machine

234
00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:49.440
to the network is important,
but they tied it to

235
00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:51.720
you as an employee, such
that they know what I

236
00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.570
have. Like they have like
this automatic asset system, they

237
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:57.600
know what, what phones I
have, what computers I have.

238
00:12:57.810 --> 00:13:01.110
And as they, as they
move around, they can kind

239
00:13:01.110 --> 00:13:02.820
of shut you off the
network. And they can say,

240
00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:07.050
well, that's, that's, Hanselman's remote
cart, his remote video cart.

241
00:13:07.050 --> 00:13:08.910
And he doesn't have this
patch and we've warned him

242
00:13:08.910 --> 00:13:12.660
three times. So he's out,
But you're not out forever.

243
00:13:12.660 --> 00:13:15.360
It's you patch it. Yeah.
And then you're back on

244
00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:18.180
you go back and actually
they're there so fine grain.

245
00:13:18.180 --> 00:13:20.340
I remember. Do you remember
the code red virus? The

246
00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.800
whole, yeah. So years and
years ago, I was actually

247
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.620
as a vendor in, so
I was on campus at

248
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.770
Microsoft razzing into their network
and we were actually local.

249
00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:31.080
I was physically there and
I was there actually, I

250
00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:34.350
think it was, you've all
Lowery, who is a, he's

251
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:36.450
an MVP and a really
well known speaker and stuff.

252
00:13:36.450 --> 00:13:38.160
And you've all we were
in there for like SQL

253
00:13:38.160 --> 00:13:40.740
server, some kind of a,
of a design review. I

254
00:13:40.740 --> 00:13:42.570
don't remember what it was,
but what I remember distinctly

255
00:13:42.570 --> 00:13:45.330
was that suddenly we're sitting
in this conference room, we're

256
00:13:45.330 --> 00:13:50.160
having our meeting and the
network goes out and I'm

257
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.930
like, okay, I can't get
on the web. I have

258
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:54.330
no, I have no, I
have no email. This is

259
00:13:54.330 --> 00:13:57.270
like six, seven years ago,
whenever code red happened or

260
00:13:57.270 --> 00:14:02.130
Ninda. And then two guys
walk in the room and

261
00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:05.370
they say, someone in here
has a virus and we've

262
00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:09.330
shut access to this room.
Wow. Off. So we did,

263
00:14:09.390 --> 00:14:10.950
I thought that it went
out at the entire building

264
00:14:10.950 --> 00:14:13.540
or whatever, or the entire
internet went down. Right. Cause

265
00:14:13.540 --> 00:14:15.900
this that's what it feels
like, but they had a

266
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:19.920
granularity where they detected, you
know, evil. I just want

267
00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:21.750
to imagine there was like
this three D model that

268
00:14:21.750 --> 00:14:24.630
spun around and the room
lit up and flash red.

269
00:14:24.630 --> 00:14:27.720
And there was like this
voice that was like dispatched,

270
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:31.740
you know, security team, alpha
two sector four. It's exactly

271
00:14:31.980 --> 00:14:35.430
just like, like that, that
Jurassic park thing where the

272
00:14:35.430 --> 00:14:37.260
girls, like, this is a
Unix machine. I know how

273
00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.190
to use this. I know
this. Yeah. The two guys

274
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.320
walked in, they shut the
room off. So they actually

275
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:46.950
knew at the port level.
Wow. And that, that was

276
00:14:46.950 --> 00:14:49.380
actually the only time I'd
ever seen anyone. Actually, I

277
00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:51.950
was just thinking about that.
I had said before, I'd

278
00:14:51.950 --> 00:14:54.830
never seen an it guy.
That was one time. And

279
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.870
I haven't seen one since
they've always been kind of

280
00:14:56.870 --> 00:15:02.210
nameless, faceless aliases that I
talked to. I'm trying to

281
00:15:02.210 --> 00:15:05.210
get access for my video
conferencing system. And I've been

282
00:15:05.210 --> 00:15:07.550
having all these interactions with
all these different people, talking

283
00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:10.580
about a port, a specific
port that I need enabled

284
00:15:11.420 --> 00:15:14.720
on a specific physical port
on the wall. And there's

285
00:15:14.720 --> 00:15:17.450
a security review and dah,
dah, dah. And even though

286
00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:22.700
it's presence, the telepresence thing,
Damien Edwards, and I need

287
00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:26.030
to get access to a
specific TCP port. So I

288
00:15:26.030 --> 00:15:28.280
fill out a form it's
all automated. It goes to

289
00:15:28.280 --> 00:15:30.800
an automated system and then
a human gets involved. They

290
00:15:30.800 --> 00:15:34.220
did a security analysis and
it's not just for one

291
00:15:34.220 --> 00:15:36.590
machine to get access to
one port, but literally a

292
00:15:36.590 --> 00:15:39.410
port in the wall in
my office and building 42

293
00:15:39.410 --> 00:15:42.620
is going to have access
to this particular port. And

294
00:15:43.220 --> 00:15:45.590
it's all very, very automated.
And apparently it's tied to

295
00:15:45.590 --> 00:15:49.670
my, my employment contract, such
that if I abused my

296
00:15:49.670 --> 00:15:53.690
privileges, having access to this,
this port, outside the firewall,

297
00:15:53.690 --> 00:15:57.620
then they can fire me.
Wow. Yeah. I wonder how

298
00:15:57.620 --> 00:16:01.370
that would happen. Like if
you're doing, if you're living

299
00:16:01.370 --> 00:16:02.630
in, if you're in a
small company, I mean, I

300
00:16:02.630 --> 00:16:04.460
just remembered saying, Hey, I
want that port open to

301
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:07.000
the internet. Right? Yeah. Nobody
would even really ask why.

302
00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:08.560
Right. They would just be
like, Oh yeah, I can

303
00:16:08.560 --> 00:16:11.860
do that. Yeah. But the
interesting thing is that that's

304
00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:14.320
when the companies get nailed,
right. It's right. At that

305
00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.380
point where they're starting to
grow. Right. That first company

306
00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:19.600
in Seattle, when we got
our T one, that was

307
00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:22.060
a big deal. And I
remember a couple of times

308
00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:25.030
of somebody going, Oh no,
I think we have a

309
00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.690
virus. And the solution was
run to this, run to

310
00:16:28.690 --> 00:16:33.400
the server room and unplugged
the internet. Yeah, exactly. I

311
00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:35.980
mean, wild West, right? We
didn't have firewalls. We didn't

312
00:16:35.980 --> 00:16:39.850
have Hi. This is Scott
coming to you from another

313
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:43.180
place in time. Are you
using agile practices to manage

314
00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:45.430
your software development? There's lots
of tools in the market

315
00:16:45.430 --> 00:16:47.440
that manage the steps of
a project, but most of

316
00:16:47.440 --> 00:16:50.680
them focus on individual roles,
get ready for a solution

317
00:16:50.680 --> 00:16:53.110
that caters for the success
of the whole team. Guys

318

R I K Keller. We
do appreciate it. There wouldn't

332
00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:47.050
be a Hansel minutes. If
there wasn't, Tellerik helping us

333
00:17:48.010 --> 00:17:50.070
well, what do you, how
do you that problem? Like,

334
00:17:50.070 --> 00:17:52.260
did you, did you get
an email from Gawker media

335
00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:54.650
this week? Yeah. Yes, no,
actually I didn't get an

336
00:17:54.650 --> 00:17:58.280
email, but I did. LinkedIn
was kind enough to say

337
00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.430
you might have used the
same password on LinkedIn that

338
00:18:01.430 --> 00:18:03.860
you had for comments. And
it, it got me to

339
00:18:03.860 --> 00:18:06.830
change my LinkedIn password. Right.
And I couldn't remember if

340
00:18:06.830 --> 00:18:10.490
I'd ever signed up for,
I mean, I read life,

341
00:18:10.490 --> 00:18:14.470
hacker, Gizmodo, reading gadget. I
read all those, but I

342
00:18:14.510 --> 00:18:16.670
don't know if I've ever
made a comment. Exactly. I

343
00:18:16.670 --> 00:18:18.590
didn't even know I had
an account there. So for

344
00:18:18.590 --> 00:18:20.000
those of you who are
listening, I may not be

345
00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:24.860
familiar with this. A hacker
group hit a conglomerate, a

346
00:18:24.860 --> 00:18:29.660
company called Docker Gaw, K
E R Gawker media, who

347
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:32.090
is the owner of a
bunch of blogs, like life

348
00:18:32.090 --> 00:18:33.860
hacker and give motives cause
Moto. So they're kind of

349
00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.920
a holding company for blogs,
but they're not very big.

350
00:18:37.070 --> 00:18:40.400
Like they're, they're big in
the sense of, there's a

351
00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:43.910
lot of popular blogs that
with names you'd recognize, but

352
00:18:43.910 --> 00:18:46.310
they're, they're not big in
the sense that they obviously

353
00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.460
don't have a very large
it department. They're probably a

354
00:18:49.460 --> 00:18:51.590
pretty small company, you know,
I guess maybe a couple

355
00:18:51.590 --> 00:18:54.800
hundred people, if not less,
probably. So they got nailed

356
00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:57.500
this week by a hacker
group that literally stole a

357
00:18:57.500 --> 00:19:02.900
copy of their database and
actually coding horror. Jeff Atwood

358
00:19:02.900 --> 00:19:04.880
had a very good blog
post about all the things

359
00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.340
that were wrong with this,
but ultimately they posted all

360
00:19:07.340 --> 00:19:09.800
of our email addresses and
passwords. So they were literally

361
00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:14.180
storing our passwords in clear
text in their database. So

362
00:19:14.180 --> 00:19:16.730
you got an email from
LinkedIn. I got an email

363
00:19:16.730 --> 00:19:21.020
from Hulu, from Netflix saying,
we have detected that, you

364
00:19:21.020 --> 00:19:23.120
know, you used your email
address and set that up.

365
00:19:23.510 --> 00:19:27.290
So I went and changed
my passwords everywhere. Yeah. And

366
00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.290
I'm thinking I should probably
go changing that. Here's the

367
00:19:30.290 --> 00:19:32.090
part, here's the bad part
that I don't know what

368
00:19:32.090 --> 00:19:34.340
password I used it go
here. So I don't know

369
00:19:34.340 --> 00:19:36.890
if I should change my
passwords at 25 places. It

370
00:19:36.890 --> 00:19:39.080
certainly shows a big problem
with a number of things.

371
00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:42.890
Identity on the web is
broken. Everyone uses the same

372
00:19:42.890 --> 00:19:46.010
password, I guess like the
word monkey was in the

373
00:19:46.010 --> 00:19:48.380
top 10 passwords used. Yeah.
I think one, two, three,

374
00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:50.600
four, five, six was one
of the top ones. Yeah.

375
00:19:50.630 --> 00:19:53.660
Yeah. Password password with an
add sign for the a,

376
00:19:54.290 --> 00:19:55.820
I don't know why monkey
was in the top 10,

377
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:58.250
but so What about something
like, I mean, not to

378
00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:01.370
stray off topic here, but
what about something like last

379
00:20:01.370 --> 00:20:03.710
pass? W what are your
feelings on like totally use

380
00:20:03.710 --> 00:20:06.470
last pass? I do too,
but I still, I don't

381
00:20:06.590 --> 00:20:08.840
use it the way that
they probably want me to

382
00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:10.820
use it. Like they probably
want me to generate some

383
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:12.980
password that I don't even
know what it is Because

384
00:20:13.040 --> 00:20:15.050
that, but then when you're
out and about somewhere with

385
00:20:15.050 --> 00:20:16.460
your iPhone, you're not going
to be able to get

386
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.130
on, Or you have to
log into last pass. You

387
00:20:19.130 --> 00:20:20.630
have to go to the
page and say, show me

388
00:20:20.630 --> 00:20:23.210
the copy and paste. It
it's a total thing. No,

389
00:20:23.210 --> 00:20:26.420
it was password management solution.
That's that's reasonable. But the

390
00:20:26.420 --> 00:20:28.880
point I wanted to make
was that here's a company.

391
00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.010
Let's just call them a
small company because I don't

392
00:20:31.010 --> 00:20:35.120
know how big they are.
That is successful clearly. Cause

393
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.480
we all read these websites,
but they made a mistake

394
00:20:39.230 --> 00:20:44.060
at an it level. Was
it okay for them to

395
00:20:44.060 --> 00:20:45.770
have made that mistake when
they were five people or

396
00:20:45.770 --> 00:20:48.880
two guys in a garage?
At what point do you

397
00:20:48.880 --> 00:20:51.130
start to tighten the screws
and be serious about the

398
00:20:51.130 --> 00:20:55.420
business? Should, what if this
happened to a one person

399
00:20:55.420 --> 00:20:58.500
company? Well, well, the thing
is right is, is it's

400
00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:01.410
almost like you should have
known better. Right? Well, hindsight

401
00:21:01.410 --> 00:21:06.000
is always 2020. They should
have known Pastors in the

402
00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.690
Clare. I mean, I, I
do, I do small projects

403
00:21:09.690 --> 00:21:15.180
for nonprofit agencies and stuff,
and I'll never do that.

404
00:21:15.180 --> 00:21:20.070
I'll always encrypt stuff or
hash it, or That's the

405
00:21:20.070 --> 00:21:22.230
obvious thing, but there could
have been, you know, let's

406
00:21:22.230 --> 00:21:23.490
say that you do all
those things that you could

407
00:21:23.490 --> 00:21:26.160
still get nailed somehow. Right.
You know, you're still good,

408
00:21:26.220 --> 00:21:29.970
but the auditing and the
fixture, they have had security

409
00:21:29.970 --> 00:21:33.120
reviews. Like at what size
should accompany start to turn

410
00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:38.700
the screws and make their,
it practices best practices. It

411
00:21:38.730 --> 00:21:42.240
probably takes something like this
to make it happen. I

412
00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:45.060
mean, it's a sad as
that sounds, but I mean,

413
00:21:45.060 --> 00:21:46.620
we've all been in the
room when we're trying to

414
00:21:46.620 --> 00:21:49.710
explain to a manager or
something that look, this is

415
00:21:49.710 --> 00:21:51.450
just the right way to
do this. And they say,

416
00:21:51.450 --> 00:21:53.460
well, how, you know, how
much time is that going

417
00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.980
to take? And you say
40 hours. And they say,

418
00:21:55.980 --> 00:21:57.870
well, we can't charge the
client for that. Or we

419
00:21:57.870 --> 00:22:01.140
can't, we can't, you know,
bill this company for this

420
00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.110
work. And you know, that's,
we're too small to do.

421
00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.810
I mean, I don't know.
I don't know if there's

422
00:22:06.810 --> 00:22:10.140
like a, a hundred is
the number or 500, but,

423
00:22:10.750 --> 00:22:14.160
but literally it takes, it
always takes something like this

424
00:22:14.160 --> 00:22:18.240
for someone to go, Oh
shoot. Yeah. Somebody warned me

425
00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.490
about this. We had an
issue of trying to remember

426
00:22:20.490 --> 00:22:22.770
who we had on the
show recently, a couple of

427
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:26.970
weeks ago was talking about
standards. It was Steve Sanderson.

428
00:22:26.970 --> 00:22:29.790
He was talking about knockout
JS knockout JS is a

429
00:22:29.790 --> 00:22:34.080
JavaScript library that lets you
put HTML five attributes on,

430
00:22:35.340 --> 00:22:38.880
on HTML elements and use
JavaScript to data bind. And

431
00:22:38.910 --> 00:22:41.820
he made the comment that
it'll work on ISX, but

432
00:22:41.820 --> 00:22:43.140
we don't. We know that
I used to on five

433
00:22:43.140 --> 00:22:45.540
doesn't work on Isaacs. And
he says, well, you know,

434
00:22:45.540 --> 00:22:49.110
it won't validate, but he
said, I've never had an

435
00:22:49.110 --> 00:22:52.050
it person tell me that,
you know, I care more

436
00:22:52.050 --> 00:22:57.240
about validation H validates GML
than about the business problem,

437
00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.480
you know? And, and you
bring up an interesting point

438
00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:01.890
that, you know, you, you
go and you talk to

439
00:23:01.890 --> 00:23:04.350
the boss, you know, the
suit, whoever they are. And

440
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.200
you explain the situation and
you say, here's the risk

441
00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:09.930
we're going to do X
and it'll cost this much.

442
00:23:09.930 --> 00:23:11.790
We're going to do, Y
it'll cost that much more.

443
00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:15.900
Why is more secure? Which
do you want? They're going

444
00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:17.130
to make a decision. It
may not always be there.

445
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:20.190
And in a bigger company,
they are a lot more

446
00:23:20.190 --> 00:23:24.090
likely to listen to those
kinds of things. So smaller

447
00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:28.080
company, 20, 30 people, you
say 40 hours, they instantly

448
00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:31.710
think, wow, I'm charging $200
an hour for you, 40

449
00:23:31.710 --> 00:23:34.230
hours. That's a ton of
loss revenue for something that

450
00:23:34.230 --> 00:23:38.190
might not even happen. Whereas
in a bigger company, you

451
00:23:38.190 --> 00:23:41.670
might say that's 125 hours
and nobody even blinks. They're

452
00:23:41.670 --> 00:23:44.130
like, yeah, that's the right
way. That's what you should

453
00:23:44.130 --> 00:23:48.230
do. I'm sure that obviously
that, that probably doesn't happen

454
00:23:48.230 --> 00:23:52.490
sometimes as well, even in
bigger companies, but especially around

455
00:23:52.490 --> 00:23:54.980
the software markets that you
know, you and I were

456
00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:58.660
working in securities, probably one
of the biggest concerns. I

457
00:23:58.660 --> 00:24:01.330
will say that definitely when
I was working at, there's

458
00:24:01.330 --> 00:24:03.730
only a couple of hundred
people. We had Greg Hughes,

459
00:24:03.730 --> 00:24:05.980
who's the host of run
ass radio. I was one

460
00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.800
of the main security guys.
Definitely not screwing around. Like

461
00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:11.230
when you're working with the
fed and working with all

462
00:24:11.230 --> 00:24:13.780
the regulators that are crawling
around, I told a story

463
00:24:13.780 --> 00:24:19.600
once about how I received
some customer data, like in

464
00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:22.390
an email and they wipe
your machine. Yeah, exactly. So,

465
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:24.730
you know, right. I mean,
I just, literally, I kind

466
00:24:24.730 --> 00:24:26.560
of joke about it, but
it was effectively, I stood

467
00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.720
up, I put my hands
up in the air, I

468
00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.830
didn't touch my machine and
I called for help. And

469
00:24:32.830 --> 00:24:34.000
they came and they like,
they, you know, they did

470
00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:36.610
the whole, And there's that
moment of, Oh no. Why

471
00:24:36.610 --> 00:24:40.320
did you send me this?
Yes, exactly. And, but that

472
00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:43.360
the process was in place
and they nuked the machine

473
00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:45.520
and they nuked every machine
that machine ever looked at,

474
00:24:45.580 --> 00:24:49.390
you know, they did the
complete chain of custody and

475
00:24:49.390 --> 00:24:51.340
it was a buddy and
it was like a bummer,

476
00:24:51.340 --> 00:24:52.660
but it was good that
we had that in place.

477
00:24:53.410 --> 00:24:56.740
Yeah. Because then it takes,
I mean, it takes away

478
00:24:56.740 --> 00:24:59.770
all reason of doubt from
you. I mean, there's no,

479
00:25:00.160 --> 00:25:02.830
nobody can ever say that,
Whoa, that might've been on

480
00:25:02.830 --> 00:25:05.770
his machine or Right. But
it brings up an interesting

481
00:25:05.770 --> 00:25:07.600
question though, when we do
work on the side, you

482
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.910
know, like you've mentioned that
you did a little, little

483
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:12.340
nonprofit business here and there,
and I've done a little

484
00:25:12.340 --> 00:25:15.400
work on the side with,
you know, small consulting gigs

485
00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:20.080
and stuff, but we're starting
as small businesses as, as

486
00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.140
one and two person, you
know, side shops to use

487
00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:27.820
cloud services. Like you use
some invoicing software, right? Like

488
00:25:27.820 --> 00:25:31.560
I've used simply build.com. The
stuff that I've used is,

489
00:25:31.560 --> 00:25:33.850
has been Google docs. I
mean, it's pretty simple. Right?

490
00:25:33.910 --> 00:25:36.310
Well, but see, I use
storing credit cards, you know,

491
00:25:36.310 --> 00:25:37.810
those kind of the question
like when you bring it,

492
00:25:38.290 --> 00:25:39.580
but you know what I'm
saying, when you think about

493
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.010
a small company of one
person or a 10 person

494
00:25:42.010 --> 00:25:44.740
company who uses all these
different cloud services, there might

495
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:48.130
be someone who has, let
me reframe me phrase it

496
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.070
this way. You're a small
consultancy that before you worked

497
00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.020
in your current job, you
had 20 people you said,

498
00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:56.680
right. But that was years
ago. Right. Right. If that

499
00:25:56.800 --> 00:25:59.140
exact same company, that exact
same size, we're starting up

500
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:04.240
now, some large number half
or more possibly all of

501
00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:06.280
the services that it used
would be in the cloud.

502
00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:09.250
Oh yeah, totally. How do
you know then if those

503
00:26:09.250 --> 00:26:14.800
services are not themselves small
businesses with bad practices, storing

504
00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.530
credit cards and passwords, Well,
you totally, you don't. And,

505
00:26:17.710 --> 00:26:20.650
and then, and even with
you say, Oh, well, it's

506
00:26:20.650 --> 00:26:23.680
Google, but you know, Google's
not impervious to any of

507
00:26:23.680 --> 00:26:26.550
this either. Right? Sure. I
mean, hopefully you help. And

508
00:26:26.590 --> 00:26:30.700
you, you really want to
assume and think that, Oh,

509
00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:34.950
well, Google knows what they're
doing. Maybe they just gotten

510
00:26:34.950 --> 00:26:37.630
really lucky so far, or
maybe they do know what

511
00:26:37.630 --> 00:26:40.150
they're doing. Google won't goof
it up as much as,

512
00:26:40.150 --> 00:26:44.970
you know, Fred's personal invoicing
system dot, but it brings

513
00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:47.250
up an interesting point because
now you're distributing the risk

514
00:26:47.250 --> 00:26:50.520
amongst a bunch of other
folks that are also small

515
00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:55.110
businesses. It makes me wonder
what's next in the sense

516
00:26:55.110 --> 00:26:57.990
of is someone, you know,
if like PayPal or QuickBooks

517
00:26:57.990 --> 00:27:03.060
or some small system that
is used by thousands, where

518
00:27:03.060 --> 00:27:05.250
does that risk get distributed?
Like if someone gets sued,

519
00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.230
someone gets nailed. Like, what
do you do? Do you

520
00:27:07.230 --> 00:27:11.310
go to your client and
say, Hey, my small client,

521
00:27:11.820 --> 00:27:15.420
the upstream cloud-based invoicing provider
that I use with storing

522
00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:19.460
credit cards, I, I, if
that was something that happened

523
00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:21.920
to me, I think I
would have to obviously be

524
00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:26.270
honest and go forward to
them and say, this event

525
00:27:26.270 --> 00:27:30.710
has happened. Here's what I
know. Here's what they did.

526
00:27:30.710 --> 00:27:33.320
I mean, what, what can,
how can I make you

527
00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:35.630
feel better? But is there
some way to mitigate that?

528
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:39.860
Right? Like, so why not
ask them for a copy

529
00:27:39.860 --> 00:27:42.560
of their security policy or
their privacy? I'm sure all

530
00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:45.200
that stuff is in the
terms and conditions that we

531
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:47.510
all gloss over or would
we just, yeah, yeah, yeah.

532
00:27:47.510 --> 00:27:50.150
Except, And what you just
said, I think is the

533
00:27:50.150 --> 00:27:52.580
point that we all gloss
over. I think that the

534
00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:56.510
fact that we distribute those
things now as small businesses

535
00:27:56.540 --> 00:28:01.250
and smaller companies means that
we shouldn't gloss over them

536
00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:05.150
like you and I, and
people who are listening, who

537
00:28:05.150 --> 00:28:08.600
are doing micro ISB should
audit those services that they

538
00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:13.160
use and just take, it's
kind of like, you know,

539
00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:16.700
once a year you change
the, you change the power.

540
00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.380
What do you call it?
The batteries on your smoke

541
00:28:18.380 --> 00:28:20.750
detectors, and you turn your
clocks back. Maybe you should

542
00:28:20.750 --> 00:28:25.040
go and audit the services
that your company uses and,

543
00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:28.700
and just take a day,
get those, get those policies

544
00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:30.740
and make sure that they're
in line with what you

545
00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.010
want to provide to your
customers. Even then, it's not

546
00:28:34.010 --> 00:28:36.440
a guarantee though, right. But
don't you think that the

547
00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:39.050
doing it is better than
the not doing it. Like

548
00:28:39.050 --> 00:28:40.970
you're basically, I'm looking at
you, you have kind of

549
00:28:40.970 --> 00:28:43.130
like a, I just don't
know that I'm even qualified

550
00:28:43.130 --> 00:28:45.020
to do that. I don't,
I mean, other than read

551
00:28:45.350 --> 00:28:49.160
some legalees or something and
try to interpret what somebody

552
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.650
says they're going to do
or how they say they

553
00:28:51.650 --> 00:28:54.110
operate. Yeah. But the key
there is true that what

554
00:28:54.110 --> 00:28:56.210
they write down may not
be necessarily what they're doing.

555
00:28:56.660 --> 00:29:00.230
But I think that they
do the, the consciousness of

556
00:29:00.230 --> 00:29:02.480
it is the point that
being conscious and saying, here's

557
00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:06.710
my workflow client comes in,
I put his, you know,

558
00:29:06.710 --> 00:29:09.200
our or qualified lead comes
in. I put that into

559
00:29:09.350 --> 00:29:13.250
this application in the cloud,
salesforce.com or whatever sure. Client

560
00:29:13.250 --> 00:29:15.680
becomes a qualified lead. And
then I start to sell

561
00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:18.050
the client. I start to
invoice them with whatever, simply

562
00:29:18.050 --> 00:29:22.640
bill.com or Fred's invoicing. And
then those payments come in

563
00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:26.960
via PayPal. So, you know,
client personal information is moving

564
00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.460
from machine to machine cloud
system to cloud system. Let

565
00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:33.500
me give you another example.
I was at my chiropractor

566
00:29:33.500 --> 00:29:37.370
this afternoon, and I was
noticing as we were sitting

567
00:29:37.370 --> 00:29:39.530
in his office that he
had Excel documents sitting on

568
00:29:39.530 --> 00:29:41.650
his desktop, you know, I
wasn't at them, but I

569
00:29:41.650 --> 00:29:45.250
saw the Excel icon and
it crossed my mind. I

570
00:29:45.250 --> 00:29:48.130
wonder if my social security
number is sitting on this

571
00:29:48.130 --> 00:29:52.150
guy's machine that he bought
at office Depot and what

572
00:29:52.150 --> 00:29:54.910
is my right, or what
should I do as a

573
00:29:54.910 --> 00:29:58.900
consumer with this small business
who is a growing business,

574
00:29:58.900 --> 00:30:02.500
right? If it was a
chain, a chiropractic chain, they

575
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:04.180
would have an it department
that would have locked all

576
00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:06.640
this stuff down. But at
what point does that happen?

577
00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:10.030
Right? How many people do
we interact with on a

578
00:30:10.030 --> 00:30:13.720
regular basis, have our personal
information sitting in their email

579
00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.110
or on their, their desktop
and to our original point

580
00:30:17.110 --> 00:30:19.600
at the beginning of this
whole show, how big is

581
00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:22.440
the point where that starts
to really matter? Again, I

582
00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.930
think it is bad as
it sounds. I think it

583
00:30:24.930 --> 00:30:28.140
takes something has to happen
to, to make somebody wake

584
00:30:28.140 --> 00:30:30.580
up and smell the coffee.
That bothers me. That, that,

585
00:30:30.650 --> 00:30:33.750
like, you're basically saying until
something goes wrong. No, one's

586
00:30:33.750 --> 00:30:37.200
going to say anything. I
mean, people didn't probably install

587
00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:40.050
smoke alarms until houses started
burning down. Right. I mean,

588
00:30:40.710 --> 00:30:44.000
Yeah. Well, that's true. This,
this brings up actually the,

589
00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:46.590
the, the backup issue that
I had last week, you

590
00:30:46.590 --> 00:30:49.110
remember my car drive crashed
your SSD. Yeah. And I

591
00:30:49.110 --> 00:30:53.160
mentioned on Twitter that, you
know, backups always work. It's

592
00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:56.490
restores that fail. I actually
had a comment in my

593
00:30:56.490 --> 00:31:00.660
blog today where someone questioned
that I was lying about

594
00:31:00.660 --> 00:31:03.660
the restore because they had
never really had a restore

595
00:31:03.670 --> 00:31:07.260
succeed. They'd had all these
backups, but, you know, restoring

596
00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:09.710
just never quite works out
for them. Well, think, I

597
00:31:09.710 --> 00:31:12.240
mean, how many times I've
heard it a million, not

598
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:14.220
a million, but I've heard
it more than 10 times

599
00:31:14.220 --> 00:31:16.710
of, Oh yeah. We have
a backup policy and I've

600
00:31:16.710 --> 00:31:18.240
actually heard people say, have
you ever tried to do

601
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:22.260
a restore? And there's that
awkward pause and people say,

602
00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.910
what do you mean? So
I've worked at two companies.

603
00:31:26.910 --> 00:31:29.340
I can think of that.
That I, you know, I'd

604
00:31:29.340 --> 00:31:32.220
ask the question is all
this backed up? And people

605
00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:35.610
would say yes, and then
some catastrophic event would happen.

606
00:31:35.970 --> 00:31:38.780
And before, you know, it,
people are like looking at

607
00:31:38.790 --> 00:31:41.940
your temporary internet files, you
know, they're, they're grasping it.

608
00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.860
How do we get this
data back? How do we,

609
00:31:44.460 --> 00:31:47.100
you know, something's lost. I
was talking to some guys

610
00:31:47.100 --> 00:31:50.430
at Microsoft that run a
large website. And many, many

611
00:31:50.430 --> 00:31:54.120
years ago, this website went
down and basically it went

612
00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.630
down because the SQL server
failed and they had dropped

613
00:31:57.630 --> 00:32:00.120
some, basically someone was poking
around there weren't things in

614
00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.290
place. And someone dropped a
table and, you know, horrific

615
00:32:04.290 --> 00:32:06.360
things happen in a week
later, the site became back

616
00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:09.210
up and all the processes
were put in place. And

617
00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:13.020
when they were talking to
the forensics guy afterwards and

618
00:32:13.020 --> 00:32:15.270
they said, well, what should
we have done? Because the

619
00:32:15.270 --> 00:32:17.700
forensics guy was poking around
on the hard drive, trying

620
00:32:17.700 --> 00:32:19.230
to figure out how we
could get this table back.

621
00:32:19.230 --> 00:32:22.740
And he said, if you
delete something that is so

622
00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:25.530
crucial, so important that it
can't be deleted. If you,

623
00:32:25.650 --> 00:32:28.170
if you find yourself in
that situation, you said, pull

624
00:32:28.170 --> 00:32:32.100
the power cord, pull the
power cord. Don't let that

625
00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:35.400
hard drive, right. Another bite,
because then you want to

626
00:32:35.400 --> 00:32:38.340
melt that hard drive, read
only and poke around a

627
00:32:38.350 --> 00:32:41.060
four. It turned out that
after this bad thing happened,

628
00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.550
the person who did it
ended up trying to do

629
00:32:43.550 --> 00:32:45.560
a bunch of other stuff.
And it was, it was

630
00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.490
in the stumbling around that
they basically erase their evidence.

631
00:32:49.490 --> 00:32:51.650
It's kind of like, you
know, I've dropped something in

632
00:32:51.650 --> 00:32:53.600
a pile of powdered sugar
on the ground. So I'm

633
00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:55.460
going to stomp around on
it, trying to find my

634
00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:59.300
lost contact lens. Totally. Everything
goes bad. And they destroyed

635
00:32:59.540 --> 00:33:05.060
all the evidence and pounded
on, on the desk. Gotta

636
00:33:05.060 --> 00:33:08.000
put those processes in place.
Yeah. I think that if

637
00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.780
a small company, a small
company should think about this

638
00:33:11.780 --> 00:33:14.890
kind of stuff now, before
they become big companies. Yeah.

639
00:33:14.890 --> 00:33:17.080
And I think small companies
need to realize that there's

640
00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:22.510
just a certain cost to
do business and just being

641
00:33:22.510 --> 00:33:25.900
responsible, you know, acting in
a responsible way. And maybe

642
00:33:26.110 --> 00:33:29.590
it's not all about what
our books look like. Right.

643
00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:32.260
It's it's about, are we
doing the right thing for

644
00:33:32.260 --> 00:33:34.120
our clients? Are we doing
the right thing for our

645
00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:40.090
employees? There's just costs involved
with doing business. I mean,

646
00:33:40.090 --> 00:33:44.080
sometimes it's a new monitor
sometimes it's time. Sometimes it's

647
00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:48.760
something else, but Yep. Sometimes
it's auditing your security system

648
00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.440
in reading legal aid, just
to make sure that you've

649
00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:52.780
done it at least one.
And that's kind of where

650
00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:55.000
a small company has been
so focused on the bottom

651
00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.960
line sometimes it's because you
don't even know it, but

652
00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:04.030
they're barely making payroll. Yeah.
Well, thanks John backdoor for

653
00:34:04.030 --> 00:34:07.060
talking to me about that
transition between small, medium and

654
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:10.180
large companies. I know I've,
I've made that transition and

655
00:34:10.180 --> 00:34:13.870
you've made that transition and
it's, it's definitely an interesting

656
00:34:13.870 --> 00:34:17.200
ride. I wonder what my
next company will be someday

657
00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:19.090
in the future, whether it
will be bigger or smaller

658
00:34:19.090 --> 00:34:23.440
than the Microsoft. I appreciate
your time. Thanks, Scott. This

659
00:34:23.440 --> 00:34:25.810
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes and I'll see

660
00:34:25.810 --> 00:34:26.590
you again next week.
