00:00:17.330 --> 00:00:21.950
web developer and technologist Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan and

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.850
I'm singing show number three

episode, Scott talks with Mark Powell,

9
00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.680
senior software engineer at jet
propulsion laboratories about his work

10
00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400
on the Mars Lander mission,
including the most recent curiosity.

11
00:01:04.370 --> 00:01:06.230
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman.
This is another episode of

12
00:01:06.230 --> 00:01:08.900
Hansel minutes. And today on
the line, we've got Mark Powell.

13
00:01:08.900 --> 00:01:12.950
He's a senior software engineer
at jet propulsion laboratory. If

14
00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.820
that's not a pretty scary
sounding company, what does jet

15
00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:19.340
propulsion laboratory? And how does
that, how does that relate

16
00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:26.030
to space? Jet propulsion laboratory
was started out in the

17
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:33.020
forties during world war II
era. The Caltech had a

18
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.980
bunch of people who were
experimenting with rockets and with

19
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:42.260
a, with an aim to
be able to send observational

20
00:01:42.590 --> 00:01:46.370
satellites and the like, and
just base. And they went

21
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:50.480
out to the Arroyo Seco
out here near Pasadena, locking

22
00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.430
yadda, California, Southern California, and
started firing off rockets and

23
00:01:55.430 --> 00:02:02.090
eventually succeeded in beating several
other institutions in creating unmanned

24
00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:04.340
probes to send into space.
And that was kinda the

25
00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.530
start of it. And that
was followed up by, through

26
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:12.530
the missions to a moon
and Mars and Venus and

27
00:02:12.530 --> 00:02:19.520
elsewhere and Voyagers and things
like Viking Lander in the

28
00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:22.940
seventies, went to Mars and
gave us our first clear

29
00:02:23.030 --> 00:02:27.230
pictures from the surface. And
here we are today, a

30
00:02:27.230 --> 00:02:30.830
couple of rovers on Mars
And you're a software engineer.

31
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:33.850
How is that different? Like
from a rocket scientist, if

32
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:36.590
you're like at a party
and someone hears you work

33
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.440
at JPL, do you get
to say, Oh, you know,

34
00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:43.490
I'm a rocket scientist, I
guess we can, although I

35
00:02:43.490 --> 00:02:46.850
suppose it's not entirely fair.
We get to take a

36
00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:49.700
lot of the credit for
people who work directly on

37
00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:54.110
the systems for things like
precision landing. And so a

38
00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.920
lot of us have enjoyed
seeing the videos about the

39
00:02:58.070 --> 00:03:01.150
seven minutes of about we're
going to hit the atmosphere

40
00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:03.820
and then there's all this
heats and then there's parachutes

41
00:03:03.820 --> 00:03:07.690
and thrusters and radar, and
all these elements that come

42
00:03:07.690 --> 00:03:12.670
together in perfect synchronicity to
guide this spacecraft down to

43
00:03:12.670 --> 00:03:15.400
the surface of Mars. It
was really just a, you

44
00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.130
know, a relatively small team
of people who work on

45
00:03:18.130 --> 00:03:22.150
that. And then other bros
who work on various aspects

46
00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:25.270
of the Rover itself and
the software that is used

47
00:03:25.270 --> 00:03:29.250
to plan for it and
give it its instructions. Someone

48
00:03:29.250 --> 00:03:31.710
said that a lot of
the specs in the hardware

49
00:03:31.710 --> 00:03:34.500
for the Mars Lander were
set a long time ago.

50
00:03:34.890 --> 00:03:37.740
So when they, when people
who were like me layman,

51
00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.410
see these specs online, they're
like, well, this is old.

52
00:03:40.410 --> 00:03:43.560
My iPhone has more power
than the Lander with the

53
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.200
why is there such a
lag? Is it, is it

54
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:48.630
stability or what is it
that's keeping us from putting

55
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:52.740
the latest and greatest stuff
up in Mars? Yeah, it's

56
00:03:52.740 --> 00:03:55.980
totally a legacy. And totally
just due to the, to

57
00:03:55.980 --> 00:03:58.200
the age of this project,
I have to realize that

58
00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:02.130
Mars science laboratory began as
a project almost 10 years

59
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:06.240
ago. And you know, when
it was first spec, you

60
00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.030
know, what's what it has
as far as computing power

61
00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.210
and the amount of memory
and other systems on board

62
00:04:12.480 --> 00:04:15.420
were cutting edge at the
time. And, you know, even

63
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:19.260
now we're, we're only able
to make smaller increments to

64
00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:22.110
what was then the cutting
edge for systems that have

65
00:04:22.110 --> 00:04:26.790
to operate in space. You
can't just take like the

66
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:31.470
latest Intel or AMD chips
and go wild with it

67
00:04:31.500 --> 00:04:37.890
without taking some precautionary measures
for operating in an environment

68
00:04:37.890 --> 00:04:42.660
where you can have solar
radiation hits, that will cause

69
00:04:42.660 --> 00:04:49.710
your computers to reboot sporadically
randomly. So the, the compute

70
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:54.210
elements and electronics and instruments
all operate under the constraints

71
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:00.000
of operating what they call
a radiation Harmon environment. The,

72
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:06.240
the rad 6,000 on Mars
exploration rovers and the Rams

73
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:12.090
seven 50 CPU on curiosity,
those are built to handle

74
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:14.760
a radiation hardened environment. And
in fact, all of the

75
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:17.550
kind of CPS that you
have on like GPS satellites

76
00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:20.970
and other kinds of satellites
around the earth also have

77
00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.050
that capability in order to
operate in that environment. I

78
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:28.590
like being safe here on
earth. You know, initially as

79
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:31.440
someone who's always kind of
working on the latest stuff

80
00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:33.990
on the web, when I
hear that someone's working on

81
00:05:33.990 --> 00:05:37.080
something 10 years old, my
first reaction just as a,

82
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:39.780
as a geek is I
don't want to work on

83
00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:42.960
old stuff, but then this
might be a funny parallel.

84
00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:45.360
I'm interested in what you
think about this. My, my

85
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.660
Xbox updated recently, and it
got an all new dashboard

86
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:51.840
and all this new functionality.
And I went online and

87
00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.740
X-Box is like eight years
old. And they're shoving all

88
00:05:55.740 --> 00:05:59.510
of this in like eight
megs of space. And then

89
00:05:59.510 --> 00:06:01.580
I said to myself, well,
it would be a real

90
00:06:01.580 --> 00:06:07.520
challenge to make amazing new
functionality on older hardware. And

91
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:09.950
the fact that it's old
might mean that I might

92
00:06:09.950 --> 00:06:13.970
learn new things about something
old and then say, Oh,

93
00:06:13.970 --> 00:06:16.040
wow, I could exploit this
and I can exploit that.

94
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:18.500
So it's a, a new
and interesting challenge, even though

95
00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.490
the hardware might be older.
Is that a reasonable Parallel

96
00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.780
to draw? I think it's
totally reasonable parallel. It is

97
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:30.790
an interesting challenge to write
software for that environment. I

98
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:35.410
have the luxury of writing,
mostly ground tools. And so

99
00:06:35.410 --> 00:06:37.270
I get, you know, I
get the pleasure of being

100
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:39.490
able to use things that
are more modern, you know,

101
00:06:39.490 --> 00:06:44.200
web tools, rich IDs that
run on desktop computers and

102
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.260
that sort of thing. But
for those who have to

103
00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:50.470
create the onboard software, they
have to face that challenge.

104
00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:52.480
They have to say, well,
sure, I want to be

105
00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.620
able to create an autonomous
driving algorithm that can recognize

106
00:06:56.620 --> 00:07:01.240
obstacles and keep it Rover
safe, autonomously so that we

107
00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:03.070
have less people in the
loop. And we can do

108
00:07:03.070 --> 00:07:05.710
more with the time that
we have on Mars while

109
00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:08.590
the spacecraft is still alive,
but they have to do

110
00:07:08.590 --> 00:07:12.460
it on a 200 megahertz
CPU with a limited amount

111
00:07:12.460 --> 00:07:15.910
of memory. And so, yeah,
they have to be, that'd

112
00:07:15.910 --> 00:07:18.670
be very clever about the
approaches that they use to

113
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:22.600
actually implement those out rooms.
How are those decisions made

114
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:26.110
if you're making ground control
systems, you, you personally right.

115
00:07:26.110 --> 00:07:28.720
Work on, on those systems,
is that right? That's right.

116
00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.360
Then, then what if you
say, I want to throw

117
00:07:31.360 --> 00:07:33.310
in this open source library,
or I want to add

118
00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:36.040
this new technique or this
new feature, is that going

119
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.280
to take years of, of
specs and documentation? I'm trying

120
00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:42.310
to get my sense around,
like, I think everyone who's

121
00:07:42.310 --> 00:07:44.980
listened has worked at a
big company before, and they

122
00:07:44.980 --> 00:07:48.310
have that sense of like
big company speed versus startup

123
00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:51.370
speed. You know, you have
a reasonably sized team, but

124
00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.630
you got a lot of
moving parts and you got

125
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:53.680
to get it right. So
I want to get a

126
00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:56.920
sense of how much bureaucracy
is involved in your software

127
00:07:56.920 --> 00:08:01.150
choice. Well, there's certainly is
a bureaucracy involved, you know,

128
00:08:01.150 --> 00:08:04.150
as much as there would
be anywhere else, as far

129
00:08:04.150 --> 00:08:07.680
as open source libraries in
ground software, we've been fortunate

130
00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:11.590
that we've been able to
prove out that using open

131
00:08:11.590 --> 00:08:14.320
source libraries for key elements
of the work that we

132
00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:19.090
do and on operating these
rubbers from the ground, it

133
00:08:19.090 --> 00:08:20.320
can be done at a
lower cost and it can

134
00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:24.460
be done at higher quality
than just writing all the

135
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.760
software ourselves. There, there are
a lot of opensource groups

136
00:08:27.790 --> 00:08:30.370
that are very good at
what they do. And so

137
00:08:30.370 --> 00:08:35.230
for one of the significant
elements of the ground tools

138
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:37.270
that we use to operate
curiosity, we build it on

139
00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:42.730
top of the eclipse framework.
So the, the eclipse framework

140
00:08:42.730 --> 00:08:46.570
gives us, you know, a
framework for rich desktop application.

141
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:50.590
Fats has a lot of
things that are given to

142
00:08:50.590 --> 00:08:55.290
us that we don't have
to write ourselves and have

143
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:58.920
a community of hundreds of
developers who are contributing to

144
00:08:58.920 --> 00:09:01.020
that all the time and
fixing bugs. And, you know,

145
00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.960
we don't have that many
developers here. And so we

146
00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:06.960
can build on top of
that and really focus on

147
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:13.080
our domain more effectively by
making use of the software

148
00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:15.750
framework that is available for
people to build on top

149
00:09:15.750 --> 00:09:21.050
of Isn't there a sense
of pressure though? Like, there's

150
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:23.090
that old joke of like,
well, this is hard, but

151
00:09:23.090 --> 00:09:26.780
it's not rocket science. And
I always joke about the

152
00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:29.960
difference between writing software in
the kind of the real

153
00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:33.800
world versus writing software for
like medical things or saving

154
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.140
babies. You know, if you're
working on something that's like

155
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:38.750
a, to do application, like
I'm going to go write

156
00:09:38.750 --> 00:09:41.840
the great, the world's great
new to do list manager.

157
00:09:42.140 --> 00:09:45.080
That's not, you know, saving
babies from cancer and that's

158
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:48.710
not putting a Lander on
Mars. So we tend to

159
00:09:48.710 --> 00:09:50.480
be a little fast and
loose with our, with our

160
00:09:50.480 --> 00:09:53.870
software, with our choices and
with our things. We don't

161
00:09:53.870 --> 00:09:57.110
all treat the software with
the respect that, that we

162
00:09:57.110 --> 00:10:00.230
might want to. Is there
the sense of reverence when

163
00:10:00.230 --> 00:10:02.030
you're working on this stuff?
Like, man, we can't screw

164
00:10:02.030 --> 00:10:04.280
this up. We got to
write that code slow and

165
00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:08.180
steady and test the heck
out of it. Or can

166
00:10:08.180 --> 00:10:11.750
you be sloppy at all?
Like everyone is, I think

167
00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.240
it's much more of the
former when, when you're in

168
00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:16.220
the early stages of the
project, have a lot more

169
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:19.670
freedoms to experiment and like
take the latest and greatest

170
00:10:19.670 --> 00:10:21.560
of something and say, okay,
I'm just going to prototype

171
00:10:21.590 --> 00:10:23.900
this or I'm going to
sketch it, you know, with

172
00:10:23.900 --> 00:10:27.240
the aim to work with
the people who the software

173
00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:30.200
serving and saying, you know,
if we give you a

174
00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.910
tool like this, we'd be
able to do your job

175
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:35.060
and we'll be more pleasant
experience than say this other

176
00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:38.930
way of doing things. But
as time marches on at

177
00:10:38.930 --> 00:10:39.710
the end of the day,
you have to get the

178
00:10:39.710 --> 00:10:45.080
job done. And so, you
know, it's, it's, it's all

179
00:10:45.080 --> 00:10:47.780
about at this phase now
that we've landed. It's all

180
00:10:47.780 --> 00:10:51.230
about we, we will test
everything before we trusted nothing

181
00:10:51.230 --> 00:10:57.050
is above reproach. So we
were for the first 30

182
00:10:57.050 --> 00:10:58.760
days of this mission and
a lot of our activities

183
00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:03.980
have been pre scripted with
the primary goal of building

184
00:11:03.980 --> 00:11:07.700
confidence that all of the
tools are working in concert

185
00:11:07.970 --> 00:11:11.030
actually operates the way that
we designed them to the

186
00:11:11.030 --> 00:11:14.330
way that we intended them
to. And that's anything unexpected.

187
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:19.730
It can be investigated, research,
documented anything serious, then, you

188
00:11:19.730 --> 00:11:22.010
know, find a way to
work around it or work

189
00:11:22.010 --> 00:11:25.310
differently. So I'd say we're
somewhere in between the like,

190
00:11:25.310 --> 00:11:27.350
you know, fast and loose
here, let's build, let's build

191
00:11:27.350 --> 00:11:28.790
a bright, shiny thing. That's
going to get a lot

192
00:11:28.790 --> 00:11:30.620
of attention. Maybe it has
a few bugs right now,

193
00:11:30.650 --> 00:11:33.920
but that's okay. And the
light, you know, guiding an

194
00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:38.390
airplane with people's lives or
medical devices or a software

195
00:11:38.390 --> 00:11:42.140
that runs international space station
to keep astronauts alive. It's

196
00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:44.360
kind of the other end
of that spectrum. And, you

197
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.970
know, we're guiding a robot
on Mars and so there's

198
00:11:46.970 --> 00:11:49.190
not human lives at stake,
but nonetheless, you know, a

199
00:11:49.190 --> 00:11:50.990
lot of us have, you
know, a lot of, a

200
00:11:50.990 --> 00:11:55.090
lot invested in this robotic
spacecraft and it's kind of

201
00:11:55.090 --> 00:11:59.950
our avatar and the instruments
themselves are also kind of

202
00:11:59.950 --> 00:12:03.850
the avatars of the scientists
who conceived, propose them and

203
00:12:04.390 --> 00:12:07.510
built them and put them
on the spacecraft. And so,

204
00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.790
you know, we, we, we
treat them without the most

205
00:12:09.790 --> 00:12:12.640
reverence and don't ever want
to take any risks that

206
00:12:12.850 --> 00:12:17.100
are warranted, that might jeopardize
their safety. You find that

207
00:12:17.580 --> 00:12:21.030
there's certain personality types that
work best at a place

208
00:12:21.030 --> 00:12:24.030
like JPL. I mean, might
there be a person that

209
00:12:24.990 --> 00:12:27.270
might not be suited for
this, this speed or this

210
00:12:27.270 --> 00:12:32.130
tempo or this attention to
detail in software? Hm. That's

211
00:12:32.130 --> 00:12:35.460
an interesting question. I mean,
I guess I'm saying you

212
00:12:35.460 --> 00:12:38.370
seem very calm and very
measured. I wonder if you

213
00:12:38.520 --> 00:12:40.860
might imagine a world where
you hired someone, let's say

214
00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:43.680
you hired me and you
know, it seems fine, but

215
00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:45.270
then when you bring me
into the team is like,

216
00:12:45.270 --> 00:12:47.970
you know, Hey man, we're
putting a robot on Mars

217
00:12:48.420 --> 00:12:51.120
and you're, you're a little
bit too, too much of

218
00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:54.090
a loose cannon Hanselman. You
know, we're going to have

219
00:12:54.090 --> 00:12:56.490
to ask you to leave.
We're all very relaxed here

220
00:12:56.490 --> 00:13:00.240
and focused. And your, your,
your, your check, your, your

221
00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:04.590
regularly breaking the build. I
think we have, you know,

222
00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:08.310
a wide mix of personality
sites. I think that's fair

223
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:11.730
to say on, on the
team that I lead or

224
00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:15.030
the operation product that we
build, we definitely have a

225
00:13:15.030 --> 00:13:17.820
good mix. We have some
people who are laid back

226
00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:19.710
and we got some people
who are like, you know,

227
00:13:19.950 --> 00:13:25.080
just kinda naturally caffeinated and
different people in between. We

228
00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:28.230
have some assertive personalities and
we have some passive personalities.

229
00:13:28.500 --> 00:13:30.870
So, you know, it's up,
it's up to the team

230
00:13:30.870 --> 00:13:33.060
to learn how to work
with each other and let

231
00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:36.330
everybody play to their strengths
and make sure that no

232
00:13:36.330 --> 00:13:41.130
one has minimized. But yeah,
I mean, overall, it's a

233
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:43.650
pretty cool place to work
actually. And we, we tend

234
00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.860
to integrate different personalities into
the process fairly well. Very

235
00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:49.980
few exceptions. Do you use
a pair programming? Do you

236
00:13:49.980 --> 00:13:51.600
sit together or do you
do a lot of code?

237
00:13:53.160 --> 00:13:54.930
Some of us do on
my team, we do it

238
00:13:54.930 --> 00:13:59.820
quite a bit. We find
that pair programming is awesome

239
00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:03.810
for breaking through blocks. I
can, like, I can sit

240
00:14:03.810 --> 00:14:05.820
down and I can code
for an entire day trying

241
00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:08.370
to figure out this problem
and, you know, on my

242
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:11.460
own and just keep banging
my head against it and

243
00:14:11.460 --> 00:14:14.370
get nowhere. And then I
can, you know, tomorrow I

244
00:14:14.370 --> 00:14:16.890
can sit with someone else
for 20 minutes and explain

245
00:14:16.890 --> 00:14:19.020
it to them. And then
after 20 minutes is like,

246
00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:21.750
aha, that's yeah, that's the
direction I needed to go.

247
00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:25.440
So I just burned an
entire day. That was really

248
00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:30.600
costly. So now I've kinda
learned my lesson. So there's,

249
00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:32.730
there's plenty of times when,
you know, you can just

250
00:14:32.910 --> 00:14:34.800
go in and fix a
bug, you know, on your

251
00:14:34.800 --> 00:14:36.510
own, if you know exactly
what's going on, but if

252
00:14:36.510 --> 00:14:39.150
you're building something new, if
there's something that's particularly challenging

253
00:14:39.570 --> 00:14:44.130
than per program, that can
be really advantageous. And we

254
00:14:44.130 --> 00:14:46.650
also like to use it
because it kind of spreads

255
00:14:46.650 --> 00:14:52.100
the spreads, the wealth and
spreads the knowledge we we're,

256
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:53.870
we're in the fortunate position
of being able to work

257
00:14:53.870 --> 00:14:57.230
with many aspects of operations
from being able to build

258
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.710
a three D visualizations to
show where we are on

259
00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:02.360
Mars and where's the Rover,
and what's it going to

260
00:15:02.360 --> 00:15:08.570
do to like planning out,
you know, the timing and

261
00:15:08.570 --> 00:15:13.010
the constraint and, you know,
the conflicting violations, you know,

262
00:15:13.010 --> 00:15:15.410
resources like, Oh, you can't
use this instrument in this

263
00:15:15.410 --> 00:15:18.500
other system at the same
time, or there's just not

264
00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:22.460
enough power to do that
today, all the way down

265
00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:27.320
to, you know, let's write
the, essentially the script that

266
00:15:27.350 --> 00:15:29.540
the spacecraft is going to
execute today and then being

267
00:15:29.540 --> 00:15:32.540
that up to the spacecraft.
So there's a lot of

268
00:15:32.540 --> 00:15:37.790
interesting problems in a variety
of these broad domain, which

269
00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:41.990
is a spacecraft operations. So
we didn't want anybody to

270
00:15:41.990 --> 00:15:45.050
ever feel like they're like
pigeonholed in one area. And

271
00:15:45.410 --> 00:15:49.580
so, you know, people seem
up in different areas to

272
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:53.200
make sure that nothing ever
gets old. Can you talk

273
00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:55.270
a little bit about the
difference between the work that

274
00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:57.610
you've done for the last
several years versus what's happening

275
00:15:57.610 --> 00:16:00.640
now that it's actually on
the planet, because I'm sure

276
00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:03.340
that the things have shifted
now that it's landed. You're

277
00:16:03.340 --> 00:16:06.370
not, I mean, I assume
you're not writing the software

278
00:16:06.370 --> 00:16:09.310
for a Lander in another
10 years. I mean, some,

279
00:16:09.310 --> 00:16:12.280
some, some code is stable,
but now you're sending programs

280
00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:15.310
up to it on a
daily basis. Yeah. So I

281
00:16:15.310 --> 00:16:19.330
mean, the system is, is
very, very stable now. And

282
00:16:19.390 --> 00:16:20.920
a lot of the, a
lot of the focus has

283
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:24.910
shifted to kind of streamlining
the operations of the spacecraft,

284
00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:27.610
like, okay, we have these
capable systems and we're building

285
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:30.340
trust in them and we
understand, you know, what they

286
00:16:30.340 --> 00:16:33.130
can do, what they can't
do, but we're all living

287
00:16:33.130 --> 00:16:36.820
on Mars time right now.
And the whole process of

288
00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:40.120
building the scripts that are
executed the next day, it

289
00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.670
takes about 16 hours. We
want to cut that down

290
00:16:42.880 --> 00:16:45.760
as soon as possible, because
what that will allow us

291
00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.470
to do is that will
allow us to shift to

292
00:16:47.470 --> 00:16:50.350
a more earth time schedule,
where we can, you know,

293
00:16:50.440 --> 00:16:52.390
get up and work like,
you know, nine to six

294
00:16:52.870 --> 00:16:56.950
type of hours, a few
months from now versus the

295
00:16:57.550 --> 00:16:59.650
always change in kinds of
hours that we're putting in

296
00:16:59.650 --> 00:17:03.880
right now, Mars time. I
mean, what's the number of

297
00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:06.280
hours on Mars. I mean,
it's more than just being

298
00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:08.740
in a different time zone.
Oh, it's, it's very much

299
00:17:08.740 --> 00:17:11.320
more than being in different
times because different times zones

300
00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.560
on the earth it's fixed.
Because the thing about working

301
00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:21.130
on Mars, working in this
kind of semi tele operated

302
00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:26.110
semi-autonomous mission is that the
Mars name is very close

303
00:17:26.110 --> 00:17:29.050
to the earth day, but
just different enough to make

304
00:17:29.050 --> 00:17:31.270
it a huge pain in
the neck for people on

305
00:17:31.270 --> 00:17:39.400
earth. They actually try to
work on Mars. The second

306
00:17:39.490 --> 00:17:42.070
on Mars is just a
little bit longer than the

307
00:17:42.070 --> 00:17:45.460
second owner. You have, you
have a day that's about

308
00:17:45.460 --> 00:17:49.060
24 hours plus 39 and
a half minutes. And so

309
00:17:49.230 --> 00:17:52.470
that boils down to is
that a second on Mars

310
00:17:52.470 --> 00:17:56.670
is 300 of a second,
approximately longer than an earth

311
00:17:56.670 --> 00:18:02.280
second. And so that, that
has the effect of, we

312
00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.000
want to, we want to
start our planning at night

313
00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.880
when the Rover is finished
and have it ready for

314
00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.010
it in the morning when
it's ready to wake up

315
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:13.830
and do something else, we
don't, we mainly want to

316
00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:16.260
operate during daylight hours for
obvious reasons. Like we want,

317
00:18:16.290 --> 00:18:18.030
we want to have sun
so that we can take

318
00:18:18.030 --> 00:18:21.150
pictures with, you know, an
ambient elimination. We don't want

319
00:18:21.150 --> 00:18:22.740
to take pictures in the
dark and that sort of

320
00:18:22.740 --> 00:18:27.720
thing. So, but, but what
that means is that you're,

321
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:30.300
you're, you're getting up and
coming into work if you're

322
00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:33.660
working every day, about 40
minutes later, every day. And

323
00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:36.120
so when we landed, we
like started at midnight and

324
00:18:36.120 --> 00:18:38.310
we're like, Oh, all right,
this is cool. We're programmers.

325
00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:41.870
You know, we're used to
being in accolades and going

326
00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:43.560
to bed late in the
morning and, you know, kind

327
00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:46.140
of living the nightlife, but
that only lasted a week.

328
00:18:46.230 --> 00:18:48.120
Pretty soon we were coming
in at 4:00 AM. Then we're

329
00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:50.130
coming in at 8:00 AM and
he's like, Oh my gosh,

330
00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.010
this is not so good.
And so it's been about

331
00:18:53.010 --> 00:18:56.600
30 days now, we've rotated
almost completely around and to

332
00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.160
have to do it two
more times, by the time

333
00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:02.580
we get to 90 days.
And then if, if we're

334
00:19:02.580 --> 00:19:06.360
successful after that third time,
we will have learned enough

335
00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:11.310
about how to make our
operations process more efficient and

336
00:19:11.310 --> 00:19:13.560
kind of patch our tools
and add new capabilities to

337
00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:15.930
help us with that so
that we don't have to

338
00:19:15.930 --> 00:19:17.640
do it a fourth time.
That would be really great

339
00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.940
for the people who are
working here. It's very exciting

340
00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.720
working on Mars, but after
three, three times of that's,

341
00:19:25.340 --> 00:19:29.250
I went through it on
a spirit and opportunity going

342
00:19:29.250 --> 00:19:32.280
through. And again, now it's,
it can be tough for

343
00:19:32.280 --> 00:19:34.950
the home life. Especially if
you have a family at

344
00:19:34.950 --> 00:19:37.890
home, you know, children who
want to see mommy or

345
00:19:37.890 --> 00:19:41.100
daddy, and they don't, they
don't get to see them

346
00:19:41.100 --> 00:19:44.130
as often as they did
before. So I want to

347
00:19:45.120 --> 00:19:46.950
want to make the most
of our time on Mars,

348
00:19:46.950 --> 00:19:50.010
we want to, you know,
be able to sustain that

349
00:19:50.010 --> 00:19:51.810
for a long period of
time. Cause we have a,

350
00:19:52.170 --> 00:19:54.780
we have a mission, a
nominal mission for curiosity. That's

351
00:19:54.780 --> 00:20:01.020
about two years with the
expectation of hopefully even more

352
00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.420
than that afterward. Wow. So
if you've got a 24

353
00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:10.730
hour and 40 minutes or
39 minutes, long day, and

354
00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:14.510
are you referring to time?
Are you saying it's nine,

355
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.240
nine o'clock on Mars. And
do you have a watch

356
00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.930
that set tomorrow's time? Yeah.
A lot of us have

357
00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:23.990
different ways of coping with
that. A lot of the

358
00:20:23.990 --> 00:20:26.990
planning and scheduling during the
day does happen and is

359
00:20:26.990 --> 00:20:30.290
announced during Mars time. So
we have like 24 hour

360
00:20:30.290 --> 00:20:33.380
clocks that are, you know,
digital clocks that are wired

361
00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.250
tomorrow's time. Some people have
watches, some people have, you

362
00:20:37.250 --> 00:20:39.770
know, apps for their iPhone
or Android that have Mars

363
00:20:39.770 --> 00:20:43.700
time. There's one of our
Rover drivers is also an

364
00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:46.310
Android developer and created a
Mars time app for himself.

365
00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:51.880
And, you know, some people
have created alarm clocks that

366
00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.520
are on Mars time. They
like hacked into a digital

367
00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:57.550
alarm clock so they can
sit there, alarm on Mars

368
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.190
time and get up for
their shifts to the right

369
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:05.380
time every day. And there's
a, there's a watchmaker here

370
00:21:05.380 --> 00:21:09.130
in town who for a
couple of hundred dollars, we'll

371
00:21:09.190 --> 00:21:14.530
adjust a watch for you
to make the crystal workings

372
00:21:14.530 --> 00:21:17.800
of it, you know, just
a little bit floor, so

373
00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.820
that it'll give you a
Mars time on your wrist.

374
00:21:22.120 --> 00:21:25.290
If you want to wear
it for a little bit,

375
00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.760
this indulging, that Formalize though,
you haven't like sat down

376
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:31.860
as a group and decided
like, like what do you

377
00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.460
call that extra 39 and
a half minutes? Is that

378
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:39.300
midnight? Or is that just
an extra long maintenance midnight,

379
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.630
a hundred minutes long is
that hour between 11 and

380
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:47.070
midnight, a hundred minutes long
instead of 60. So no,

381
00:21:47.070 --> 00:21:50.390
the, the minutes and the
hours and the, and the

382
00:21:50.400 --> 00:21:54.480
days all work the same,
there's 24 hours and 60

383
00:21:54.480 --> 00:21:57.480
minutes, 60 seconds a minute.
And all of that, it's

384
00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:00.480
just that the seconds are
long. And so, yeah. So,

385
00:22:01.080 --> 00:22:03.930
so you have to, you
have to algorithmically map what

386
00:22:03.930 --> 00:22:07.980
Mars time is to what
earth time is. And so,

387
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:12.000
yeah. Yeah. I see. I
tried to, in my mind,

388
00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:13.740
I tried to map it
like it was a time

389
00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:15.870
zone and you just kind
of reminded me that, wait

390
00:22:15.870 --> 00:22:18.900
a second. No, if we
are taking this longer time

391
00:22:18.900 --> 00:22:22.410
and dividing by 24, everything
changes, minutes are slightly longer.

392
00:22:22.410 --> 00:22:25.380
Seconds are slightly longer, so
it could be 11 o'clock,

393
00:22:25.410 --> 00:22:30.600
but it's a stretchy 11
o'clock That's right. That's right.

394
00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.330
We keep, we keep it
all, you know, based on

395
00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:36.110
what was originally the Babylonians,
right. We have, we have,

396
00:22:36.180 --> 00:22:39.990
we have 67 minutes, 62nd,
60 minute hours and 24

397
00:22:39.990 --> 00:22:42.330
hour days. But they are
in fact actually just a

398
00:22:42.330 --> 00:22:45.570
little bit longer, but we
kind of ignore that when

399
00:22:45.570 --> 00:22:47.820
we're working on Mars, because
we want the time systems

400
00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.540
to make, to make sense
intuitively for what people expect.

401
00:22:51.630 --> 00:22:54.450
It's like, okay, two Mars
hours from now, we're going

402
00:22:54.450 --> 00:22:56.520
to have this thing. And
so we have like Gantt

403
00:22:56.520 --> 00:22:59.460
charts and schedule meetings laid
out, okay, we're going to

404
00:22:59.460 --> 00:23:02.850
start at this time local
mean solar time. And it's

405
00:23:02.850 --> 00:23:06.120
going to be two hours
long. And, And I know

406
00:23:06.120 --> 00:23:09.960
as someone who's worked in
international banking myself that time

407
00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:14.550
zone math is like the
number one most painful thing

408
00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.800
that there is to deal
with. And once you add

409
00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:19.110
in things like leap seconds,
you know, just everything goes

410
00:23:19.110 --> 00:23:21.810
to heck, how are you
managing that? Like I know

411
00:23:21.810 --> 00:23:23.520
that one of the things
we do on earth is

412
00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:26.640
we focus on GMT, right?
Do everything in Zulu time

413
00:23:27.060 --> 00:23:29.910
and adjust from there. What
is the clock on the

414
00:23:29.910 --> 00:23:33.000
actual Rover set to versus
maybe your web servers running

415
00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:38.730
some software that you wrote,
Right? So there's there there's

416
00:23:38.730 --> 00:23:40.920
many different types of systems
in places, the earth time

417
00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:44.160
system. Then there's also kind
of a, a nominal Mars

418
00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:48.710
time system that has time
zones and the whole thing.

419
00:23:49.730 --> 00:23:57.800
So they've defined 24 time
zones on Mars. And so

420
00:23:57.830 --> 00:24:02.420
curiosity is in one of
them. And we use, you

421
00:24:02.420 --> 00:24:06.650
know, local means solar time
to compute times that happen,

422
00:24:06.710 --> 00:24:09.230
you know, on the average,
in that time zone. And

423
00:24:09.230 --> 00:24:14.570
then there's local true solar
time. That is accurate to

424
00:24:14.690 --> 00:24:17.690
exactly where the Rover is.
That's useful for some other

425
00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:24.170
calculations like computing or simulating,
how much heat the spacecraft

426
00:24:24.170 --> 00:24:26.870
is going to experience on
any given day. And then

427
00:24:26.900 --> 00:24:30.620
the spacecraft clock itself is
just a computer clock on

428
00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:35.150
a chip and it has
drifts and we have to

429
00:24:37.010 --> 00:24:40.790
model that and, and work
with that. And so there's,

430
00:24:41.330 --> 00:24:44.270
you know, there's lookup tables
and software that will convert.

431
00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:47.660
Okay. What, how many, how
many spacecraft clock seconds was

432
00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:50.780
this image taken for example,
and what does that in

433
00:24:51.050 --> 00:24:53.000
local mean solar time? What
does that local truth all

434
00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.910
the time? What does that
MGMT? And so we have

435
00:24:55.910 --> 00:25:00.800
a whole framework software framework
developed at JPL called spice

436
00:25:01.430 --> 00:25:06.410
that helps us with that.
It's used on many different

437
00:25:06.410 --> 00:25:10.430
missions to Mars and elsewhere
to handle all these time

438
00:25:10.430 --> 00:25:13.760
conversions for us. So we
kind of rely on that

439
00:25:13.970 --> 00:25:17.780
to algorithmically convert between all
these times systems that we

440
00:25:17.790 --> 00:25:20.650
need to run. And this,
this might be a fullest

441
00:25:20.650 --> 00:25:23.440
question or a wrong question,
but how do you know

442
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:26.230
you're right? Like how do
you, you're not there? How

443
00:25:26.230 --> 00:25:27.970
do you know that this
is really how it works?

444
00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.650
I mean, it's all PhDs
with math on paper who

445
00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:37.450
are pretty sure things work
this way. Well, there's a

446
00:25:37.450 --> 00:25:40.270
number of ways we can
kind of check ourselves. One

447
00:25:40.270 --> 00:25:44.820
of them is to observe
the sun. For example, if,

448
00:25:45.010 --> 00:25:47.830
if our spice routines tell
us that at a certain

449
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:49.840
time, we expect, you know,
Mars to be at this

450
00:25:49.840 --> 00:25:54.220
position and rotated around its
axis by this much and

451
00:25:54.490 --> 00:25:57.880
the sun to be at
this relative location, then we

452
00:25:57.880 --> 00:25:59.980
can put the camera up
and take a picture of

453
00:25:59.980 --> 00:26:02.380
the sun and look at,
you know, where was the

454
00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:04.540
Rover and what was its
heading and what was the

455
00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:07.660
pointing vector of the camera
at the sun at that

456
00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.990
time and say, yeah, okay.
We're, we're doing fine. You

457
00:26:10.990 --> 00:26:12.310
know, where the sun is.
We know when it was

458
00:26:12.310 --> 00:26:15.850
there. Do you do that
often? I mean, do you

459
00:26:15.850 --> 00:26:18.310
have to check your, do
you'd have to check your

460
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:20.860
work? And is there anything
that you discovered once you

461
00:26:20.860 --> 00:26:23.500
got there? You're like, Oh
wow, we totally got that

462
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.330
wrong. And we had, now
we have to adjust for

463
00:26:25.330 --> 00:26:28.780
it after the fact, now
that it's landed, We do

464
00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:31.480
check it a lot. We
have been fortunate that we

465
00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:36.910
haven't found any significant errors
yet in the time systems.

466
00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:42.220
But as I was saying
before, the, the spacecraft clock

467
00:26:42.220 --> 00:26:45.300
itself does have, and so
eventually it's going to, you

468
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:49.350
know, tend to, you know,
start to lag or start

469
00:26:49.350 --> 00:26:53.490
to move forward from where
it has been before. And

470
00:26:53.490 --> 00:26:57.810
so we have to continually
watch it to compensate for

471
00:26:57.810 --> 00:27:00.960
that and kind of adjust
the look up tables that

472
00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:05.130
we're using to convert from
the spacecraft time to the

473
00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.600
standardized time systems. And Now
that that drift is being

474
00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:11.750
adjusted, how differently from how
it might be adjusted on

475
00:27:11.750 --> 00:27:14.090
my PC that I'm sitting
at looking. Right, right. Right

476
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:18.380
now, like I have a
time server, so I don't

477
00:27:18.380 --> 00:27:20.060
have to worry about that.
Right. I have NTP and

478
00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:22.670
I can let the atomic
clock in Colorado figure this

479
00:27:22.670 --> 00:27:24.410
stuff out for me. And
you are effectively your own

480
00:27:24.410 --> 00:27:28.490
atomic clock up there, aren't
you? Well, it's a definitely,

481
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:30.140
wouldn't call it an atomic
clock. I mean, it's just,

482
00:27:30.410 --> 00:27:32.360
it's just a, it's just
a crystal on a chip.

483
00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:34.850
Right? So The point is,
you're saying, when you say

484
00:27:34.850 --> 00:27:37.640
drift, you're saying there's a
flaw here. That is a,

485
00:27:37.910 --> 00:27:40.490
not a flaw as, as
yet, but there's a characteristic

486
00:27:40.490 --> 00:27:44.990
of this that we know
to be unreliable, be the

487
00:27:44.990 --> 00:27:49.100
right word. Or is it
reliably unreliable? Well, I mean

488
00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:53.000
there's errors and everything, and
you know, you're, so you're,

489
00:27:53.930 --> 00:27:55.840
you're, you're crystal on a
chip is only going to

490
00:27:55.860 --> 00:28:00.230
oscillates. No. So many times
per second, in an ideal

491
00:28:00.230 --> 00:28:05.240
sense for so long before
the, before, whatever error is

492
00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:07.960
inherent in that process starts
to accumulate. And, you know,

493
00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:10.550
may take 200 days, may
take 2000 days, but eventually

494
00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:12.890
it's going to add a
second or subtract a second

495
00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:17.930
or whatever it's going to
do. Nothing's perfect. So we

496
00:28:17.930 --> 00:28:21.060
just watch for things like
that and, and adjust for

497
00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:23.570
it. Then as we notice
them, One of the things

498
00:28:23.570 --> 00:28:26.690
that we, who in the
software industry on earth have

499
00:28:26.690 --> 00:28:28.990
been watching with a lot
of excitement is this, this

500
00:28:29.190 --> 00:28:33.410
openness, I, people that seem
to consistently surprised with everyone's

501
00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:37.550
use of open source and
their interest in open sourcing

502
00:28:37.550 --> 00:28:44.660
stuff. Why are there so
few secrets, Why are there

503
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:49.820
so few secrets? I wish
there were fewer secrets. We,

504
00:28:50.270 --> 00:28:55.750
we, we really like, you
know, incorporating open source libraries

505
00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.080
and systems in, into our
systems for a number of

506
00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:05.280
reasons. Like I was saying
earlier. One is that for

507
00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.720
core specific domains that are
kind of the same, whether

508
00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:10.910
you're working in space or,
you know, work in a

509
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:15.290
bank or, or anywhere else,
there are, there are some

510
00:29:15.290 --> 00:29:19.850
systems out in open source
for, for building frameworks, for

511
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:23.660
just getting computing done that
are terrific. And it would

512
00:29:23.660 --> 00:29:27.350
cost a lot for us
to duplicate. And so it

513
00:29:27.350 --> 00:29:29.780
makes one ask the question,
well, why, why are tax

514
00:29:29.780 --> 00:29:34.250
payers paying us to duplicate
systems that are terrific, that

515
00:29:34.250 --> 00:29:38.150
already exist? And, and so,
you know, we ask ourselves

516
00:29:38.150 --> 00:29:39.830
those questions and say, well,
Hey, we can, we can

517
00:29:39.830 --> 00:29:42.970
do a better job for
this mission for NASA, by,

518
00:29:43.390 --> 00:29:46.870
you know, learning and using,
you know, and vetting this

519
00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:49.630
particular open source library to
do this aspect of our

520
00:29:49.630 --> 00:29:53.140
work and allowing ourselves to
spend more time on learning

521
00:29:53.140 --> 00:29:57.190
how to operate the spacecraft
better or improve these features

522
00:29:57.190 --> 00:29:59.410
that are going to make
things more efficient. And a

523
00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:02.980
part of working in the
space aerospace domain in the

524
00:30:02.980 --> 00:30:08.710
United States is dealing with the
legal rules that we operate

525
00:30:08.710 --> 00:30:14.770
under in this country. We
have ITR, which is a

526
00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.700
set of federal laws that
limits what information can be

527
00:30:18.700 --> 00:30:25.270
freely distributed, pertaining to articles
of war. And as it

528
00:30:25.270 --> 00:30:30.850
happens, spacecrafts that are flown
to space or other planets

529
00:30:30.850 --> 00:30:35.380
or moons also fall into
that category. And so there's

530
00:30:35.380 --> 00:30:38.620
actually a lot of information
that we are legally bound

531
00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:42.760
to keep in house. And
then there's also obviously proprietary

532
00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.280
information like at any institution
to maintain a competitive advantage.

533
00:30:46.300 --> 00:30:50.320
You want to have a
prietary information, be protected and

534
00:30:50.320 --> 00:30:56.170
living in house, but wherever
possible, if it's, if it's

535
00:30:56.170 --> 00:30:59.410
information, for example, like that
has come back from the

536
00:30:59.410 --> 00:31:04.630
spacecraft on Mars, and it's
not per se proprietary. It's

537
00:31:04.630 --> 00:31:09.190
not, you know, it's something
that was the end result

538
00:31:09.190 --> 00:31:12.490
of operating the spacecraft, but
it wasn't the operation of

539
00:31:12.490 --> 00:31:15.190
the spacecraft on Mars. It's
like a picture that was

540
00:31:15.190 --> 00:31:18.940
taken or the location of
the Rover today. There's no

541
00:31:18.940 --> 00:31:23.200
reason not to share that
information with everyone who has

542
00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.960
a stake in this, which
are all the taxpayers who

543
00:31:25.970 --> 00:31:29.070
pay for it. Very cool.
Well, we appreciate it. I

544
00:31:29.070 --> 00:31:30.840
mean, we just, the fact
that I'm even able to

545
00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:35.490
talk to you is pretty
awesome, frankly. Cool. Thanks. Yeah.

546
00:31:35.610 --> 00:31:38.940
It's always a treat for
us to be able to

547
00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:41.100
talk to people about what
we do. We're very excited

548
00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.860
about it. Thanks a lot.
That's Mark Powell from the jet

549
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.420
propulsion laboratory and working on
the ground software operating curiosity

550
00:31:48.420 --> 00:31:51.390
on Mars right now. This
has been another episode of

551
00:31:51.390 --> 00:31:53.700
Hansel minutes. We'll see you
again next week.
