00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:52.460
<inaudible> from hanselminutes.com. It's Hansel
minutes, a weekly discussion with

9
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.500
web developer and technologists. Scott
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing

10
00:00:57.500 --> 00:01:01.550
show number four 73. In
this episode, Scott talks with

11
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.810
dr. Matthew Tesh about developing
staph pad, a new class

12
00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.310
of music notation applications. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

13
00:01:13.310 --> 00:01:15.590
is another episode of Hansel
minutes, and I am chatting

14
00:01:15.590 --> 00:01:18.650
today with dr. Matthew Tez
from Carnegie Mellon. He is

15
00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.530
the coauthor of a really
great new windows app called

16
00:01:21.530 --> 00:01:23.960
staph pad that you may
have heard about. Thanks for

17
00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:26.240
chatting with me today. No,
thank you for having me.

18
00:01:26.750 --> 00:01:29.510
This is, this has got
some pretty amazing PR I

19
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:32.180
don't know who, who made
it go kind of viral,

20
00:01:32.180 --> 00:01:34.760
but this is a really
great app and it's kind

21
00:01:34.760 --> 00:01:38.390
of marketed towards being a
surface exclusive. Although if I

22
00:01:38.390 --> 00:01:41.180
understand correctly, it does work
on any windows eight machine

23
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:44.480
it'll work on anything with
pen and touch, really active

24
00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:47.480
Pennsport. So that's why the
surface is so perfect. It's

25
00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:49.220
one of the few devices
out there that really brings

26
00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:52.730
that naturally. And what does
staph pad do that just

27
00:01:52.730 --> 00:01:56.570
blows minds? The idea behind
staph pad is it's a

28
00:01:56.570 --> 00:01:58.850
way to compose naturally. And
so it's, if you think

29
00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:03.350
of handwriting recognition, it's that
form music now. So you'll

30
00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:05.750
be able to just hand
write notes into, into a

31
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:08.360
bar. And as you move
onto the bar, it'll recognize

32
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:10.070
those and then you can
play them back, edit it.

33
00:02:10.100 --> 00:02:11.930
So it's got a lot
of the features of much

34
00:02:11.930 --> 00:02:14.420
more expensive notation programs that
are fractured with the price.

35
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.680
So this isn't an unknown,
like space. There are handwriting

36
00:02:18.710 --> 00:02:22.730
to music apps existing today.
So there's been a handful

37
00:02:22.730 --> 00:02:25.820
of people that have tried
something with the handwriting to

38
00:02:25.820 --> 00:02:29.690
music approach out there. So
yeah, there's a few in

39
00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:31.640
the space. It doesn't look
like anyone's kind of done

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:34.640
it with the same interface,
focus that we have and

41
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.040
a lot haven't done it
with that ability to that

42
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:39.950
a lot when they've done
it, they haven't used the

43
00:02:39.950 --> 00:02:42.710
pen. So it's been kind
of an iPad where you

44
00:02:42.710 --> 00:02:44.510
can press your finger and
draw on it, but it

45
00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:46.490
hasn't really given you that
full capability of pen and

46
00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:49.040
touch at the same time.
That's interesting, you know, I

47
00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:52.010
have both an iPad and
a surface and I have

48
00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:55.340
found that, and this is
just, you know, I'm just

49
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:57.470
speaking as me, it's my
opinion, but it seems like

50
00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:02.950
a lot of iPad apps
are App like application light.

51
00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:05.440
You know what I mean?
There's like, there's word. And

52
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:08.080
then there's word light and
there's garage band and then

53
00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:11.350
garage band light. And no
one never says light, but

54
00:03:11.350 --> 00:03:13.450
it's always implied that if
it's on a tablet it's

55
00:03:13.450 --> 00:03:16.960
not really full featured. And
I think that most tablets

56
00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.750
not just iPad, but also
the windows store kind of

57
00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:22.840
has that implication, that it's
not a real app. It's

58
00:03:22.840 --> 00:03:25.930
a 99 cent app. Yeah. And
that's one of the things

59
00:03:25.930 --> 00:03:29.160
we really actually faced a
little, But a difficulty when

60
00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:31.710
we were going into the
windows store marketplace, when we

61
00:03:31.830 --> 00:03:34.050
decided to develop this as
an app, rather than a

62
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:36.000
full desktop application, it was
kind of taking a leap

63
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:38.370
of faith that it wasn't
just going to look like

64
00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.330
a 99 cent problem, our program.
And luckily I think we've,

65
00:03:42.330 --> 00:03:44.130
we've hit that very well,
but that was, that was

66
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:47.730
definitely a worry is during
the development cycle That someone

67
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:49.320
would look at this and
go, why isn't this a

68
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:53.190
dollar 99? Exactly. And it's
not, it's a, in my

69
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:55.650
store at leads, it's a
it's $69, which is, you

70
00:03:55.650 --> 00:04:00.330
know, very competitively priced compared
to other handwriting application apps.

71
00:04:01.380 --> 00:04:04.770
Yeah. So, so I guess
it's, it's very competitive priced,

72
00:04:04.800 --> 00:04:07.800
especially compared to full notation
apps, which is where we

73
00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.440
really think it, it fits
in, there's a program called

74
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:13.350
Sibelius and a program called
finale out there, and these

75
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:16.710
are multi hundred dollar applications.
That'll let you really kind

76
00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.980
of play back and add
all this notation and be

77
00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:22.440
able to do very, very
detailed and tweaking things. But

78
00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:26.850
we've noticed that when people
use them, a lot of

79
00:04:26.850 --> 00:04:29.970
what they're ended up doing
is dragging menus, clicking on

80
00:04:29.970 --> 00:04:33.720
notes, learning these special ways
to enter notes into the

81
00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:36.210
music. And it's not just
like writing music naturally. And

82
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.830
so that was one of
the big focuses when we

83
00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:40.020
developed this app was to
be able to really just

84
00:04:40.170 --> 00:04:42.900
write music naturally right into
the like grind down a

85
00:04:42.910 --> 00:04:45.780
sheet of paper. Interesting. That
kind of makes me, I'm

86
00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:47.760
trying to draw parallels in
my mind to things that

87
00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:49.740
I know better because I
admit that I don't know

88
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:53.730
much about music, but I
think about creation apps for

89
00:04:53.730 --> 00:04:56.820
like creating art, you know,
Photoshop with a pen or

90
00:04:56.820 --> 00:05:01.050
illustrator with a pen versus,
you know, editing apps after

91
00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:04.140
the fact Photoshop on the
editing side or light room,

92
00:05:04.770 --> 00:05:08.130
do some applications in the
music space, try to straddle

93
00:05:08.310 --> 00:05:11.940
the editing of sheet music
versus the kind of creation

94
00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:15.420
of sheet music. Yeah. I
think it's a largely unexplored

95
00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.120
space and I've been, I'm
coming at this from the,

96
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:20.340
from the developer point of
view rather than necessarily the

97
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.370
musician point of view. So
the, my experience with those

98
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.220
notation apps, I am a
musician as well, but it's

99
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.780
not as advanced as certainly
some people out there, but,

100
00:05:29.780 --> 00:05:31.650
but I definitely wouldn't when
I use those programs, I

101
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:34.290
see it much more as
an editing tool rather than

102
00:05:34.710 --> 00:05:37.500
really a composition to, I
feel, I can't really be

103
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.230
thinking naturally when I'm, when
I'm trying to use one

104
00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:45.150
of those And do people
who sit down and, and,

105
00:05:45.270 --> 00:05:48.510
and write music from hand
like this, they understand this

106
00:05:48.510 --> 00:05:51.390
music, like, like, like they
like it like someone who

107
00:05:51.390 --> 00:05:54.180
has a sketchpad, like the
it's almost like paper for

108
00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:58.910
the iPad for music. Exactly.
Exactly. Yeah, yeah, Yeah. This

109
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:01.870
is this, it feels really
natural to me And people

110
00:06:01.870 --> 00:06:04.660
who are composers like your,
like your partner and your

111
00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:08.980
partner in crime here, the,
the composer, David, William Hern.

112
00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:12.670
He, he, I imagined him
sitting with his surface, like

113
00:06:12.700 --> 00:06:15.760
out in a park somewhere,
maybe some headphones on, he

114
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:17.890
hears music in his head
and he needs to get

115
00:06:17.890 --> 00:06:20.680
it out onto paper as
quickly as possible in an

116
00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:24.720
accurate way. Exactly. Yeah. And
that's, that's the ability you

117
00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:27.520
can't really, I mean, there's
people that have been able

118
00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.980
to compose by maybe playing
something on an instrument and

119
00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:32.380
kind of feeding that into
a music composition program. But

120
00:06:32.380 --> 00:06:34.630
usually they're doing this like
in a studio. And so

121
00:06:34.630 --> 00:06:37.120
that's, that's where some of
these more powerful tools actually

122
00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:40.480
happen really, really used to
compose things is when you're

123
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:42.910
hooking up a live instrument
to it, but you can't

124
00:06:42.910 --> 00:06:44.770
just walk out into the
middle of the park and,

125
00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.110
you know, set up your
iPad and, or set up

126
00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:50.410
your Mac and a mini
keyboard and all this stuff.

127
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:52.750
And just start playing it's
it's here with this. You

128
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:54.010
could really just take it
into the middle of the

129
00:06:54.010 --> 00:06:56.650
field and start writing music.
Okay. So let's dig into

130
00:06:56.650 --> 00:06:58.420
a little bit of like,
how did you make this?

131
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:00.340
Is it written in C
sharp? Is it written in

132
00:07:00.340 --> 00:07:04.540
G? Yeah. So it's, so
it's actually all written in

133
00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:06.670
C sharp. And this was,
I had met my first

134
00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:13.060
journey into really C-sharp heavy
applications. Really. Wow. That's impressive.

135
00:07:13.060 --> 00:07:15.430
Because a lot of people
have commented on the, how

136
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:19.120
polished a staff pet is.
Yeah. So I, this was

137
00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:20.740
a learning project. It's been
a couple of years, so

138
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:23.500
it's not like something I
figured out overnight, but I

139
00:07:23.650 --> 00:07:25.960
learned a lot about, XAML
a lot about C-sharp in

140
00:07:25.960 --> 00:07:29.260
the last, last couple of
years with us. Were there

141
00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:31.780
any like limitations where you
just slammed up against something?

142
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:36.070
I was like, Oh, we
cannot do that because, Oh

143
00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:40.450
yeah. Limitation. So I'm not
really sure there, there aren't

144
00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.120
any big ones that stick
in my mind. I remember,

145
00:07:43.420 --> 00:07:44.890
and this has been back
a couple of years, but

146
00:07:44.890 --> 00:07:47.170
when I, when I first
started looking into the documentation

147
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:50.730
of the windows store APIs
versus the full API, is

148
00:07:50.730 --> 00:07:52.630
that you could write on
a windows, desktop. I, there

149
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:55.330
were some limitations there. And
so occasionally I'd find a

150
00:07:55.330 --> 00:07:57.160
reference to a function that
I really, really wanted to

151
00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.730
use, but kind of, but
it seems like over the

152
00:08:00.730 --> 00:08:03.400
years, those limitations have gotten
less and I've been able

153
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:06.280
to work around most of
the ones that I've still

154
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.470
encountered. I, I wish I
could think of an example

155
00:08:08.470 --> 00:08:10.450
off the top of my
head. No, If you think

156
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:14.140
of one, you can definitely
jump in. Yeah. So it

157
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.600
sounds like if one's not
at top of mind, it

158
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:20.800
wasn't nothing major that was
like, Oh, we're screwed and

159
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.410
we're halfway down, but we
can't finish because windows store

160
00:08:23.410 --> 00:08:26.500
apps can't do that. Exactly.
Yeah. There's nothing that ended

161
00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:29.290
up blocking the, the, the
development of the app in

162
00:08:29.290 --> 00:08:32.950
the end, From a perf
perspective. Cause when I use

163
00:08:32.950 --> 00:08:35.500
like drawing apps, like paper
on the iPad, there's always

164
00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:37.870
a complaint that the ink
doesn't get laid down fast

165
00:08:37.870 --> 00:08:41.080
enough or that it's not
responsive enough, you know, frames

166
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:43.030
per second of the ink
that you're capturing. Did you

167
00:08:43.030 --> 00:08:45.830
have any performance issues? Yeah.
So initially when we did

168
00:08:45.900 --> 00:08:48.730
Did everything with, XAML just
like kind of raw in

169
00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.170
strokes and raw drawing lines,
we ended up with with

170
00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:55.770
some performance issues as you
started getting more and information

171
00:08:55.770 --> 00:09:00.660
out on the page. Those
have been less as we've

172
00:09:00.960 --> 00:09:03.330
removed all the rendering code
to C sharp or sorry,

173
00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.330
direct X really underneath cover.
So we're using sharp DX

174
00:09:06.330 --> 00:09:09.150
there to, to speed up
a lot of that. And

175
00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:12.270
when you have really a
large score with like 10

176
00:09:12.270 --> 00:09:14.460
instruments and a hundred bars
you'll need that. So you're

177
00:09:14.460 --> 00:09:17.130
not trying to rerender the
entire canvas and the virtualizing

178
00:09:17.130 --> 00:09:20.250
canvas will only get you
so far. And we're, we're

179
00:09:20.250 --> 00:09:21.960
able to do a little
bit more advanced stuff there.

180
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:24.640
And that's, that's what the
ink that we're laying down

181
00:09:24.670 --> 00:09:27.810
really actually just, you just
re rendering a couple of

182
00:09:27.810 --> 00:09:30.210
XAML lines. And so it's
turned out not to be

183
00:09:30.210 --> 00:09:32.100
a performance issue there. So
we, we did run up

184
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:33.990
against that, but I want
us to necessarily say that

185
00:09:33.990 --> 00:09:38.340
was a windows store performance
limitation versus a system limitation

186
00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:41.930
in general. So is that,
are you using sharp DX

187
00:09:41.930 --> 00:09:44.060
on top of XAML or
have you replaced AMA with

188
00:09:44.060 --> 00:09:47.300
Sharpies? We're using, yeah, we're
using it on top of

189
00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:50.150
XAML. So we've got like
a canvas. That's the background

190
00:09:50.150 --> 00:09:52.640
for that scrolling middle part
of the app. There's a

191
00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.410
kind of a couple of
menu bars at the top

192
00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:55.850
and a mini bar for
the bottom, if you've never

193
00:09:55.850 --> 00:09:58.580
opened the app and then
there's in the middle, there's

194
00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.720
a kind of where you
actually are right in the

195
00:10:00.730 --> 00:10:03.440
music. There's a few staves
of, of music and you

196
00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.260
can add notes on there.
So that, that middle score

197
00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:11.330
area is the part that's
actually a sharp DX canvas,

198
00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:14.810
but it's on top of
it. XAML canvas element. Very

199
00:10:14.810 --> 00:10:17.720
cool. And for people who
aren't familiar, a sharp DX

200
00:10:17.720 --> 00:10:19.940
is actually an open source
project. It's a free project.

201
00:10:19.940 --> 00:10:23.870
That is a, basically a,
a managed direct X API.

202
00:10:23.990 --> 00:10:26.630
So, and it's, you know,
it happens also work on

203
00:10:26.630 --> 00:10:29.760
the phone or work on
a store apps. So you're,

204
00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:33.110
you're using some open source
software in your application. Yes,

205
00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:37.850
we are more than just
sharp DX. I believe sharp

206
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:40.160
DX is, is it at
this point, at one point

207
00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:42.890
we were looking at at
different decoding options for the

208
00:10:42.890 --> 00:10:45.930
audio files. So I know
we were playing both with

209
00:10:45.950 --> 00:10:52.070
Augie, decoding and FFmpeg decoding,
and, and honestly, this is

210
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:54.200
part of where as a
developer, this was not my

211
00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:55.610
area of which it was
just kind of fun to

212
00:10:55.610 --> 00:10:57.800
say. So it's, it's been
great having David as a

213
00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:01.280
partner because he's actually been
able to, to help with

214
00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.920
some of the coding that
he's really familiar with. So,

215
00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.930
so he's been able to
help a little bit getting

216
00:11:05.930 --> 00:11:08.570
the sound fonts up a
lot of the playback stuff.

217
00:11:08.570 --> 00:11:10.820
And then he's, we've hired
a couple of contractors for

218
00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.240
kind of small niche areas
like playing back of the,

219
00:11:14.410 --> 00:11:16.580
the music and getting that
really, really high performance. Cause

220
00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:18.050
I know that's something that
a lot of time was

221
00:11:18.050 --> 00:11:20.300
put into. How do you
get these really? I mean,

222
00:11:20.300 --> 00:11:23.570
we we've recorded full like
instruments playing back at different

223
00:11:23.570 --> 00:11:26.210
pitches in different volumes and
we're cross fading neural time.

224
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:27.980
So there's a lot of
really neat stuff going on

225
00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:30.920
on under the covers, even
with the playback. Did you

226
00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.400
just use the term sound
font? I did. I hope

227
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:37.430
I used it correctly. It's
interesting because sound fonts Our

228
00:11:37.430 --> 00:11:42.020
25 year old plus concepts.
Can you talk about sound

229
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.440
funds? I, I actually don't
know A lot about sound

230
00:11:45.440 --> 00:11:48.650
fonts, so, so I know
them from the 10,000 foot

231
00:11:48.650 --> 00:11:51.980
perspective, which is basically it's.
If you have an instrument

232
00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.200
that you want to play
back the sound of then

233
00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.050
than the sound font is
like basically if you have

234
00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.120
a font for a computer,
it's how you write the

235
00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.520
letter a or write the
letter B well for, for

236
00:12:04.520 --> 00:12:06.610
an, a sound font for
an instrument. It's how you

237
00:12:06.610 --> 00:12:09.870
play the note a or
play the note B Yeah,

238
00:12:09.870 --> 00:12:13.800
yeah. Sound fonts were big
in the mid nineties, late

239
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.550
nineties when sound font, 2.0,
came out. And when people

240
00:12:17.550 --> 00:12:22.230
had the soundblaster sound card,
94, 95, 96, there's a

241
00:12:22.230 --> 00:12:24.660
thing called the all 32.
And it was like the

242
00:12:24.660 --> 00:12:27.270
first sound card that had
sound fonts. And then suddenly

243
00:12:27.570 --> 00:12:33.150
this kind of cheesy synthetic
middy sound suddenly developed richness

244
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:37.140
and, you know, video games
got a, an almost orchestral

245
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:40.170
sound to them. Yeah. And
so that's definitely kind of

246
00:12:40.170 --> 00:12:42.240
continued to get better and
better. And, and so it's

247
00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:46.180
not, it doesn't sound like
that cheesy mini playback when

248
00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:48.000
you come out and we're,
so we're doing a few

249
00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:49.890
things on top of that
as well. It's not just

250
00:12:50.370 --> 00:12:53.310
kind of raw sound font
playing back, but really, as

251
00:12:53.310 --> 00:12:56.580
you get louder and crescendo,
it's, it's mixing volumes that

252
00:12:56.580 --> 00:13:00.060
were instruments that were recorded
a softer and louder volume.

253
00:13:00.070 --> 00:13:03.300
So you're not getting just
kind of one stretched example,

254
00:13:04.170 --> 00:13:06.450
really. So you actually did
some custom recording and have

255
00:13:06.450 --> 00:13:08.700
some custom sounds inside to
make it sound the way

256
00:13:08.700 --> 00:13:11.100
you wanted it to sound.
Yeah. So there's, there's some

257
00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:14.880
that we've licensed from other
providers out there that, that

258
00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.130
have some of these really
high quality libraries. And then

259
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:19.770
we've also recorded a few
instruments ourselves. And so we've

260
00:13:19.980 --> 00:13:22.290
been able to use that
the in app purchase feature

261
00:13:22.290 --> 00:13:25.230
of, of Microsoft, of the
app store to give us

262
00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.740
the ability to download some
extra, extra sounds. And as

263
00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.450
we develop more, we can
keep adding them to the

264
00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:32.370
store. Oh, okay. So what
do I get out of

265
00:13:32.370 --> 00:13:34.800
the box? And then what
can I add Out of

266
00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.170
the box? You pretty much
get a full, a full

267
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:41.100
symphony. So you've got violins
violas, kind of a full

268
00:13:41.100 --> 00:13:45.630
string section, full brass section
horns. I think there's about

269
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.720
10 to 20 drums. Last
I looked of different orchestral

270
00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:51.600
drums. And then if you
want to really buy things

271
00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.870
and out on some later
there's things like mandolin and

272
00:13:54.870 --> 00:14:00.360
electric guitars that you can
download from, from the app

273
00:14:00.360 --> 00:14:05.930
store. Now when you're writing
in staph pad and what,

274
00:14:05.930 --> 00:14:08.820
what are this, the sections?
Is it a measure in

275
00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:11.640
between the vertical lines? Yep.
So you kind of write

276
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:13.020
a measure at a time
and then as soon as

277
00:14:13.020 --> 00:14:17.220
you leave that measure, a
lot of the code that's

278
00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.750
going on there, when you,
when you leave the measure,

279
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:22.080
it turns that into actual
written, Right? So you start

280
00:14:22.080 --> 00:14:25.110
writing and the measure and
the five lines turns red.

281
00:14:25.530 --> 00:14:27.450
And then as soon as
you move to the next

282
00:14:27.450 --> 00:14:30.660
measure that red, it kind
of pauses a moment of

283
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:33.090
pause. Like it's almost like
it's, are you still writing?

284
00:14:33.090 --> 00:14:36.690
No, he's done. Okay. And
then it immediately gets to

285
00:14:36.690 --> 00:14:39.540
recognize things and then you
have an annotation mode, so

286
00:14:39.540 --> 00:14:42.270
you can go and recognize
your notes, but then you

287
00:14:42.270 --> 00:14:45.840
also can shorten the length
of measures and you can

288
00:14:46.170 --> 00:14:50.070
have stretches and arpeggios between
things. Yeah. So there's a

289
00:14:50.070 --> 00:14:53.150
lot of kind of editing
both in resizing bars. Like

290
00:14:53.150 --> 00:14:56.510
you mentioned, adding more advanced
notation. That's not something you'd

291
00:14:56.510 --> 00:14:59.410
really want to draw or
it'd be just faster to,

292
00:14:59.410 --> 00:15:02.780
to put in by hand
like tremolo markings. And then

293
00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:05.420
there's also, I, I'm not
sure if you were listening

294
00:15:05.420 --> 00:15:07.400
to this, but there's a
sketch overlay layer where you

295
00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:10.640
can really write anything you
want on top of the

296
00:15:10.830 --> 00:15:13.280
bars. If you wanna just
make a note and say,

297
00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:15.110
Hey, I want to rework
this section later. Or if

298
00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.750
you want to add a,
kind of a, something that

299
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:21.050
we don't quite support yet,
some sort of little music

300
00:15:21.130 --> 00:15:24.040
Detail on there. And is
this using a standard file

301
00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:26.530
format that I can move
in between? Like I could

302
00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:29.530
work in staph pad then
using my, my larger desktop

303
00:15:29.530 --> 00:15:33.070
and then move away. Yeah.
We, there's a file format,

304
00:15:33.070 --> 00:15:36.070
a file interchange format for
music notation called music XML.

305
00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:41.650
And so We've implemented as
All the features that we

306
00:15:41.650 --> 00:15:43.780
support on our program. We've
kind of implemented the music

307
00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.510
XML equivalent of them. And
so that's the format we

308
00:15:46.510 --> 00:15:49.180
can export to that. And
they're changed with programs like

309
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:53.560
finale or Sibelius, And you
feel like you're going up

310
00:15:53.590 --> 00:15:56.650
like head to head with
those other big Island. Maybe

311
00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.630
I wouldn't say bigger players,
but you know, the, the

312
00:15:58.630 --> 00:16:02.080
more established players. So, so
it's interesting. I feel like

313
00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:04.450
we're really fitting kind of
in this niche between a

314
00:16:04.450 --> 00:16:06.460
couple of different players. Cause
there's, there's a couple of

315
00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:10.300
the handwriting applications for music
that are, what we feel

316
00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:13.210
either is, is a difficult
to use interface or maybe

317
00:16:13.210 --> 00:16:15.790
the recognition isn't up to
par. And so those are

318
00:16:15.790 --> 00:16:18.010
kind of your 10 to
$20 apps that maybe are

319
00:16:18.010 --> 00:16:21.460
available on iPad, where, where
the interface really isn't quite

320
00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.460
good enough to be able
to do this correctly. And

321
00:16:24.460 --> 00:16:28.390
then we have the applications
like Fanelli and Sibelius, which

322
00:16:28.390 --> 00:16:31.600
are really kind of professional
level on grieving tools. And

323
00:16:31.810 --> 00:16:35.620
so we, we only, We
support a subset of the

324
00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.600
features that a program like
that would cost, but we're

325
00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.030
also a subset of the
features of the program like

326
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:41.740
that would have, but we're
also about a 10th of

327
00:16:41.740 --> 00:16:45.700
the cost. Oh wow. And
so it's, it's this ability

328
00:16:45.700 --> 00:16:48.730
for composers that are like
in school to be able

329
00:16:48.730 --> 00:16:52.200
to have something that they
can really work with. And,

330
00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:55.600
and we're increasingly getting more
and more of the features

331
00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.480
that those programs have and
more of the editing capabilities

332
00:16:58.480 --> 00:16:59.770
that they have. And so,
so I don't want to

333
00:16:59.770 --> 00:17:02.110
say we're direct competition for
those. I, I see it

334
00:17:02.110 --> 00:17:05.140
more as a complimentary system
where you write something really

335
00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:07.840
quickly or naturally with, with
staff hat and then you

336
00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:10.120
would then export it. And
if you really wanted to

337
00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:14.860
tweak layout or add some
esoteric things on top of

338
00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:16.240
it, you could do that.
And one of these, these

339
00:17:16.240 --> 00:17:20.260
other, And have you had
updates or put out any

340
00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:23.860
updates since it came out
with 1.0, We have not

341
00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.920
yet. So we've been working
hard on getting version 2.0

342
00:17:26.950 --> 00:17:29.950
out and, and we're actually
uploading that to the store

343
00:17:29.950 --> 00:17:32.500
within the next couple of
days now. Oh, wow. Okay.

344
00:17:32.500 --> 00:17:35.440
Cool. Is there any, any
particular feature that people would

345
00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:37.930
be really impressed with? Yeah,
there's a number of small

346
00:17:37.930 --> 00:17:39.910
things we're working on. There's,
there's been a lot of

347
00:17:39.910 --> 00:17:41.500
people that want to be
able to do, for example,

348
00:17:41.500 --> 00:17:44.350
custom score ordering, so be
able to rearrange the instruments.

349
00:17:44.350 --> 00:17:46.960
And so we've, we've implemented
that we've implemented at more

350
00:17:46.960 --> 00:17:49.680
advanced time signatures. Now you
can kind of set arbitrary

351
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:53.610
numbers for the time signatures
and there's a lot of

352
00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:56.580
small improvements we've made under
the cover to recognition to

353
00:17:56.580 --> 00:18:00.120
the print engine, the layout
engine. So, so I think

354
00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:02.070
people will be impressed. There's,
we're kind of putting together

355
00:18:02.070 --> 00:18:03.960
a long list of, of
all the changes that we've

356
00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.720
made. And we've tried to,
there's been a lot of

357
00:18:06.720 --> 00:18:08.790
people that are giving us
a lot of good feedback

358
00:18:08.790 --> 00:18:10.620
and, and seem to be
really interested in the program.

359
00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:12.780
And so we're trying to
address as much of their

360
00:18:12.780 --> 00:18:14.460
kind of first round of
feedback that we can, and

361
00:18:14.460 --> 00:18:17.460
then work on the bigger
things for the next step.

362
00:18:20.370 --> 00:18:22.380
I want to take a
moment to thank our sponsors,

371
00:18:57.600 --> 00:19:02.490
your free ebook today. We're
getting, getting back to the

372
00:19:02.490 --> 00:19:04.950
basics a little bit because
I'm fascinated by like the,

373
00:19:05.200 --> 00:19:08.700
the actual, you know, the,
is it called? What is

374
00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.620
it called? The, all of
the lines. The staff staff

375
00:19:13.380 --> 00:19:15.420
is that, is that done
in fonts? Is that entirely

376
00:19:15.420 --> 00:19:17.970
laid out by you? Is
that written from scratch? So

377
00:19:17.970 --> 00:19:20.670
there's a couple different pieces
that go together. Some of

378
00:19:20.670 --> 00:19:25.020
that, like just the lines
horizontally across those are written

379
00:19:25.810 --> 00:19:27.810
that that's just like a
drawing line, primitive. So work

380
00:19:27.810 --> 00:19:31.620
using Sharpie accent saying, draw
this line now for things

381
00:19:31.620 --> 00:19:35.190
like note, heads and flags
on the notes and class,

382
00:19:35.640 --> 00:19:38.250
that's something that there's, there's
kind of a different type

383
00:19:38.250 --> 00:19:42.360
of sound font that's out
there. It's a, it's kind

384
00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.660
of a notation font. And
so we're using one of

385
00:19:45.660 --> 00:19:48.000
those. That'll actually give us
the characters for the different,

386
00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:51.150
different kinds of notes that
you'd want to put on.

387
00:19:51.180 --> 00:19:53.190
And then we can, is
it a Unicode or an

388
00:19:53.190 --> 00:19:56.400
open type font? Yeah, it's
a, it's a Unicode true

389
00:19:56.400 --> 00:19:59.550
type font and there's a
special range of characters. So

390
00:19:59.550 --> 00:20:02.430
one of the problems historically,
and music notation applications that

391
00:20:02.430 --> 00:20:08.040
it's kind of been this
really weird over mapped standard

392
00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:11.190
font, that's kind of been
extended. So maybe Q on

393
00:20:11.190 --> 00:20:16.110
the notepad stands for quarter
note or, and there's just,

394
00:20:16.110 --> 00:20:17.910
it kind of jumps around
and ours is maybe a

395
00:20:17.910 --> 00:20:20.880
quarter rest, but then there's
another note or another key

396
00:20:20.880 --> 00:20:23.310
entirely. That means they throw.
So there's not any real

397
00:20:23.310 --> 00:20:25.860
standard. And I'll tell you,
you're saying that it's an

398
00:20:25.860 --> 00:20:30.270
uncomfortable mapping between 26 letters
in English or Latin, the

399
00:20:30.270 --> 00:20:33.870
Latin key keyboards and music,
which is just simply not

400
00:20:33.960 --> 00:20:38.250
a spoken language. Exactly. And
so there's actually been a

401
00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.920
project that we've taken advantage
and open source project out

402
00:20:40.920 --> 00:20:43.830
there to try to remap
this into a sensible way.

403
00:20:43.830 --> 00:20:49.300
And so that's, it's called
SMU F L I, I

404
00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.290
forget what that's actually stands
for. It's a, but it's

405
00:20:53.290 --> 00:20:57.130
a new music markup format.
And so kind of defines

406
00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:02.260
where this whole set of
36 or there's this range

407
00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:05.530
of characters in the Unicode
set, defines all the notes.

408
00:21:05.620 --> 00:21:07.510
And so it's kind of
grouping things sensibly and making

409
00:21:07.510 --> 00:21:09.190
it a lot more easy
to work with. It's a

410
00:21:09.250 --> 00:21:13.140
more sensible mapping. So that's,
that's the standard music font

411
00:21:13.140 --> 00:21:18.330
layout. So Burt came up
with exactly Interesting. So then,

412
00:21:18.510 --> 00:21:21.750
you know, cause fonts, musical
notes and fonts like that

413
00:21:21.750 --> 00:21:23.700
idea of like, Hey, wait
a second fonts. We can

414
00:21:23.700 --> 00:21:27.960
do music that happened in
like 1984, 1995 when Adobe

415
00:21:27.960 --> 00:21:31.530
came out with Sonata. But
the thing that's so interesting,

416
00:21:31.530 --> 00:21:33.840
I think about music as
it relates to fonts and

417
00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.890
languages is if you think
about doing Latin type languages,

418
00:21:37.890 --> 00:21:40.590
that's easy, each character is
separate, but then you add

419
00:21:40.590 --> 00:21:44.640
ligatures and things that attach
to other things and then

420
00:21:44.670 --> 00:21:47.820
things get complicated. Yeah. And
so, especially with, with the

421
00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:50.850
layout of the score, there's
a lot that you can't

422
00:21:50.850 --> 00:21:53.220
just do with, with kind
of fonts and lectures. You

423
00:21:53.220 --> 00:21:56.100
can't put these two notes
beside each other and trust

424
00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.350
them to be the same
distance away. So it ends

425
00:21:58.350 --> 00:22:01.320
up, you're positioning a lot
of the core elements, very

426
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.200
carefully on the score, like
the note heads. And then

427
00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:06.240
a lot of the things
that are simple, straight lines

428
00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:10.410
like stems and beams, you're
actually drawing those primitives yourself,

429
00:22:10.410 --> 00:22:13.110
fusion, sharp DX, or dirt
using whatever graphics library you

430
00:22:13.110 --> 00:22:16.650
want. So you're kind of
really combining positioning font, symbols,

431
00:22:16.650 --> 00:22:19.680
exactly. Along with a bunch
of drawing primitives and having

432
00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:21.630
to line that up very
carefully and as well, spaced

433
00:22:21.650 --> 00:22:23.610
out very carefully. So there's
a lot of work that

434
00:22:23.610 --> 00:22:25.440
we put in to kind
of arrange in the layout

435
00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:27.720
of the music on the
page. I see. So you

436
00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:30.690
might, you know, say, Oh,
you know, Unicode cone point,

437
00:22:31.170 --> 00:22:33.870
EO two is a bracket,
but we need a really

438
00:22:33.870 --> 00:22:35.720
tall one and it has
to be pixel perfect. And

439
00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:38.850
has to be here. Exactly.
So we'll end up stretching

440
00:22:38.850 --> 00:22:41.880
that letter for example. Oh,
wow. And that is that

441
00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:45.420
expected? Is this the way
that, that they expect one

442
00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:48.870
to use these glyphs? Yes.
Yeah. It was very, the

443
00:22:48.870 --> 00:22:50.940
program was very much or
the, sorry, the font was

444
00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:54.570
very much designed for this.
Very cool. And it looks

445
00:22:54.570 --> 00:22:57.210
gorgeous. That is the thing,
because this is a fact

446
00:22:57.210 --> 00:22:58.980
a kind of font these
and, you know, and they

447
00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.190
did a nice mapping to
the Unicode stuff. They, it

448
00:23:02.250 --> 00:23:04.740
looks great. It scales nice
as well. I was a

449
00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:07.800
little bit surprised. I just
assumed somehow that it would

450
00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:12.030
be only one, you know,
100%, but it zooms very

451
00:23:12.030 --> 00:23:14.070
naturally. So you can zoom
in, make a tiny little

452
00:23:14.070 --> 00:23:16.260
annotation and then zoom right
back out and it looks

453
00:23:16.260 --> 00:23:18.750
perfect the whole time. Yeah.
And I have to give

454
00:23:18.750 --> 00:23:21.240
credit to the guys at
Steinberg, who they put together,

455
00:23:21.240 --> 00:23:24.810
we're using the river font
package, which is their implementation

456
00:23:24.810 --> 00:23:27.600
of their standard. And it's
a great looking font. Yeah.

457
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:31.740
Yeah. And does this work
on, you know, high Rez

458
00:23:31.740 --> 00:23:33.660
machines? Like I know that
the surface is very high

459
00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:37.610
Rez and the new surface
three, not the pro it

460
00:23:37.610 --> 00:23:39.690
has a much lower Rez.
Does it look good at

461
00:23:39.690 --> 00:23:42.450
any size? Yeah, we, we
have found that it looks

462
00:23:42.450 --> 00:23:44.850
pretty good at Any size.
We, we actually got the

463
00:23:44.850 --> 00:23:47.900
chance to see it on
a surface hub. And even

464
00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:51.140
at that giant, you mean
the giant 100? Yeah. Was

465
00:23:51.140 --> 00:23:53.600
it 184 or something like
that? Yeah. And so it's,

466
00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:55.520
it's amazing to see kind
of the score just on

467
00:23:55.520 --> 00:24:02.170
this giant screen and it
just worked no, No weird

468
00:24:02.230 --> 00:24:05.110
IDP, high DPI things. It
just looked great. It scaled.

469
00:24:05.260 --> 00:24:08.380
Yeah. Yeah. Everything's scaled pretty
well. No, that was a

470
00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:11.230
little, a little nerve wracking
to see that and actually

471
00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:13.330
see that everything kind of
kind of carried over, I

472
00:24:13.330 --> 00:24:15.010
guess it's, it's a Testament
to a lot of the

473
00:24:15.010 --> 00:24:17.020
frameworks, the XAML and everything
that we built off of

474
00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:19.630
it, but, well, that's also
a really cool scenario. I

475
00:24:19.630 --> 00:24:21.190
hope you got videos That,
or you can put that

476
00:24:21.190 --> 00:24:25.000
on Instagram somewhere, because I
mean, imagine if, if a

477
00:24:25.030 --> 00:24:28.300
composer could sit there with
their orchestra and a surface

478
00:24:28.300 --> 00:24:30.880
hub and work on a
score as a team with

479
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:36.100
this hundred inch giant television.
Yeah. I think that'd be

480
00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.650
a pretty neat experience. I
imagine some composers might kind

481
00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:42.880
of see that like a
backseat driver that True. True.

482
00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:46.360
Have you seen this being
used already in an academic

483
00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:48.400
scenario? Like this is a,
be a great way to

484
00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:51.310
teach people how to read
and write music? Yeah. We've,

485
00:24:51.310 --> 00:24:54.730
we've seen a couple kind
of great responses on the

486
00:24:54.730 --> 00:24:57.110
being able to use this
in an academic setting or

487
00:24:57.130 --> 00:25:00.340
an educational setting for music
classes. And so one of

488
00:25:00.340 --> 00:25:02.080
our favorites that I think
it was a group of

489
00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:06.460
middle schoolers and their teacher
used this to, to write

490
00:25:06.460 --> 00:25:08.950
some music on the, on
the whiteboards or not the

491
00:25:08.950 --> 00:25:11.860
whiteboard screen, but kind of
her projected surface screen. And

492
00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:14.650
then after that, she actually
handed the computer around to

493
00:25:14.650 --> 00:25:17.680
the kids and they each
wrote a different bar music

494
00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.540
with it. In the end,
they kind of had this

495
00:25:19.540 --> 00:25:24.070
composition and the, the teacher
added in the little harmony

496
00:25:24.070 --> 00:25:26.200
and play back and then
press tech sport and has

497
00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:31.150
an MP3 on the, on
the internet that the kids

498
00:25:31.150 --> 00:25:34.510
can go home and listen
to. That's fantastic. And how

499
00:25:34.510 --> 00:25:36.730
did you, how did you
hook up with, with your

500
00:25:36.730 --> 00:25:39.580
partner, David William Harun? Like I
understand that you had some

501
00:25:39.580 --> 00:25:42.400
page on Google code. It
seems like you guys may

502
00:25:42.400 --> 00:25:44.740
have each been thinking about
how to write an app

503
00:25:44.740 --> 00:25:47.770
like this separately and then
found each other somehow. Exactly.

504
00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.990
Yeah. So I had an
open source project that I,

505
00:25:49.990 --> 00:25:52.810
that I tried to start,
Oh, five, six years ago.

506
00:25:52.810 --> 00:25:56.740
Now I'd done a lot
of transcribing music by hand

507
00:25:56.770 --> 00:25:59.140
in, into kind of these
more expensive notation apps. And

508
00:25:59.140 --> 00:26:01.300
it was just taking forever.
And so I was looking

509
00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:03.010
for a better way to
do that and kind of

510
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:06.190
stumbled across this idea. And
he had independently stumbled across

511
00:26:06.190 --> 00:26:09.130
this idea and I had
this open source project that

512
00:26:09.130 --> 00:26:12.340
I'd just started and hadn't
really had a whole lot

513
00:26:12.340 --> 00:26:15.580
of time to, to work
out the details. And he

514
00:26:15.580 --> 00:26:17.140
saw that and kind of
emailed me out of the

515
00:26:17.140 --> 00:26:19.990
blue and took a, took
a little bit to decide

516
00:26:19.990 --> 00:26:24.280
we weren't each person wasn't
crazy. But a few years

517
00:26:24.280 --> 00:26:26.650
later we've made a law,
a lot of progress on

518
00:26:26.650 --> 00:26:29.350
it. So you've said a
few years, it sounds like

519
00:26:29.680 --> 00:26:31.450
this is one of those
examples of an app. That's

520
00:26:31.450 --> 00:26:35.110
an overnight, overnight success that
took several years to make.

521
00:26:35.530 --> 00:26:39.310
Yeah. So it it's been
in production about three years

522
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.590
now. We've kind of been
in skunk mode for the

523
00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:45.480
last few years. So you
were literally Like working on

524
00:26:45.480 --> 00:26:48.990
this in stealth mode and
you just dropped it in

525
00:26:48.990 --> 00:26:52.470
a nice, awesome, you know,
kind of coordinated way. Like

526
00:26:52.500 --> 00:26:54.980
no one knew this was
happening. Yeah. We, we managed

527
00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:57.020
to keep it pretty quiet
over the last few years.

528
00:26:58.280 --> 00:26:59.870
It was that it's just
so stressful. I mean, I

529
00:26:59.870 --> 00:27:03.380
just try to imagine like
multiple years long to not

530
00:27:03.380 --> 00:27:07.950
talk about it. I mean,
we, yeah, it was there,

531
00:27:07.950 --> 00:27:10.640
there were times where your
friends knew about it, So

532
00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:12.290
you can talk to it
with family and friends, but

533
00:27:12.290 --> 00:27:14.090
there's definitely times that I
wanted to be able to

534
00:27:14.090 --> 00:27:16.460
say a little more than
we could Where you can't

535
00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:18.230
exactly go. I suppose you
didn't have like, am I

536
00:27:18.230 --> 00:27:20.540
going to go look at
your stack overflow and find

537
00:27:20.540 --> 00:27:22.130
like, Oh, I can see
where he was having trouble

538
00:27:22.130 --> 00:27:24.860
with fonts right there. Aloha,
you know, you might find

539
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:26.930
a couple of Questions on
the Microsoft board and I'm

540
00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:29.960
trying to still struggle with
the blob upload service or

541
00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:34.190
various learning different things along
the way. Yeah. Huh. I

542
00:27:34.190 --> 00:27:36.290
understand also that there's a
little bit of C plus

543
00:27:36.290 --> 00:27:39.050
plus in this application, is
that right? Yeah. So the

544
00:27:39.050 --> 00:27:43.010
C plus plus is mainly
in the audio playback library.

545
00:27:45.200 --> 00:27:46.540
What kinda stuff do you
have to do? Like what,

546
00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:47.990
what was it that was
not easy to do or

547
00:27:47.990 --> 00:27:49.970
not from a performance perspective
needed to be done in

548
00:27:49.970 --> 00:27:51.980
C plus plus. So I
think just being able to

549
00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:54.380
know, And again, this is,
I was on kind of

550
00:27:54.380 --> 00:27:58.130
every area except the audio
playback. So I apologize if

551
00:27:58.130 --> 00:28:00.410
I'm a little ignorant. I
see. So we're into David's

552
00:28:00.410 --> 00:28:02.480
area. Now This is, this
is David on a couple

553
00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.130
of the contractors we, we
found to help us. So

554
00:28:07.130 --> 00:28:10.280
the, but the 99% Cincy
plus sentence, assuming C sharp

555
00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.320
rather. And then C plus
plus is where the sampler

556
00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.970
and the reverb and some
of them are high performance

557
00:28:13.970 --> 00:28:18.170
stuff. Exactly. And is there
a backend service at all?

558
00:28:18.170 --> 00:28:20.120
Is there anything in Azure
or something up in the

559
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.250
cloud that supports it or
is it its own standalone

560
00:28:22.250 --> 00:28:26.240
thing? So it's Program, but
we are using Azure to

561
00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:28.280
actually that the user has
an option. When they have

562
00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.960
a, a musical bar that's
not recognized properly, they can

563
00:28:32.960 --> 00:28:34.730
just go ahead and hit
a button and report that

564
00:28:34.730 --> 00:28:36.590
and send it to us.
So then it can kind

565
00:28:36.590 --> 00:28:38.510
of look through and see
where people are having trouble

566
00:28:38.510 --> 00:28:41.450
with recognition. And so we're
using Azure to host that.

567
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:44.660
Okay. That's cool. So you've
got a little bit of

568
00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:47.030
bug reporting there. Do you
have any kind of error

569
00:28:47.030 --> 00:28:50.240
reporting or a system like
Reagan or something where if

570
00:28:50.240 --> 00:28:52.620
the app crashes you get
the stack dump mailed to

571
00:28:52.620 --> 00:28:57.560
you? Unfortunately, no, that's, that's
something we definitely want to

572
00:28:57.680 --> 00:28:59.300
want to try to add
in, in the next release.

573
00:28:59.750 --> 00:29:02.960
Oh yeah. Well like they,
these guys that just to

574
00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.630
take a quick second, but
Reagan, they use, they sponsored

575
00:29:05.630 --> 00:29:08.120
us a couple of weeks
ago, but they are a

576
00:29:08.120 --> 00:29:11.870
really cool company, reagan.io. And
basically it's a global error

577
00:29:11.870 --> 00:29:14.510
handler and then it takes
every crash that gets sent

578
00:29:14.510 --> 00:29:17.450
and automatically categorizes them. And
then it will even say

579
00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:20.450
this error that you thought
you fixed, it's recurring again

580
00:29:20.450 --> 00:29:24.260
and here is what happened.
It's pretty awesome stuff. That

581
00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:26.930
sounds like that'd be great.
Yeah, that would be perfect.

582
00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:29.720
So you've got version two
coming out, you're in the

583
00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.930
windows store. Why and when
did you make the decision

584
00:29:32.930 --> 00:29:35.720
that it would be a
windows app and not on

585
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:39.860
an iPad with a stylist?
Yes. We actually spent a

586
00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:42.910
good deal of the first,
probably the first year as

587
00:29:42.910 --> 00:29:45.220
we're getting a lot of
the basic interface stuff. And

588
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:49.210
a lot of the basic
recognition code, we spent a

589
00:29:49.210 --> 00:29:51.610
while targeting Java because we
figured this to be a

590
00:29:51.610 --> 00:29:54.400
nice cross platform. And then
we'd have people plug in

591
00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:58.300
an external graphics tablet to
use it really. And then

592
00:29:58.300 --> 00:30:00.160
the surface came out and
we just found that you

593
00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.500
could, you know, draw right
on the screen and it

594
00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:05.350
made everything more intuitive. And
so that was really the

595
00:30:05.350 --> 00:30:07.480
turning point is we kind
of took a leap of

596
00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.700
faith there trying to try
to do a creative app

597
00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:12.880
on a, on a windows
device, which is certainly not,

598
00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.150
not really a standard thing
that's done these days. There's,

599
00:30:16.690 --> 00:30:18.760
I mean, there's, there's a
great Adobe creative suite and

600
00:30:18.760 --> 00:30:20.890
everything that works on windows,
but a lot of music

601
00:30:20.890 --> 00:30:24.990
apps really are, are more,
more Macintosh. Well, yeah. And

602
00:30:24.990 --> 00:30:27.780
I think also that people
may have watched and said,

603
00:30:27.810 --> 00:30:30.580
Oh, well, Microsoft must've paid
them. Or this was a

604
00:30:30.630 --> 00:30:33.480
lot of people thought it
was a Microsoft app, but

605
00:30:33.510 --> 00:30:35.860
you, you came to those
decisions on your own and

606
00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:39.240
kind of found your way
onto the surface. Yeah. Occasionally

607
00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.920
I'll see that on a
blog and I'll kind of

608
00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.570
laugh it off the person's
like, I know they must

609
00:30:42.570 --> 00:30:45.780
have gotten paid for Microsoft
and I wish we could

610
00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:47.460
say that Microsoft sent us
a lot of money, but

611
00:30:48.630 --> 00:30:50.040
They actually know that you
were doing this. Like when

612
00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.920
did Microsoft figure out that
this existed The last few

613
00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:55.650
months before the release, we'd
been talking to some people

614
00:30:55.650 --> 00:30:57.600
at Microsoft and letting them
know what was going on.

615
00:30:58.620 --> 00:31:00.060
And I think this, this
started kind of when we

616
00:31:00.060 --> 00:31:02.520
were asking some questions and,
and having some, a few

617
00:31:02.520 --> 00:31:05.970
troubles along the way, understanding
particulars of the store particulars

618
00:31:05.970 --> 00:31:09.750
of a particular like PDF
export, for example, that we're

619
00:31:09.750 --> 00:31:13.350
trying to get to work.
And so it got us

620
00:31:13.350 --> 00:31:15.300
in contact with a few
of the areas of Microsoft

621
00:31:15.300 --> 00:31:18.450
and they've become aware. And
actually one of the reasons

622
00:31:18.450 --> 00:31:20.640
we, we released it when
we did, was to correspond

623
00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.490
with the surface three release
announcement. And so at the

624
00:31:23.490 --> 00:31:25.770
end of that, that timing
actually worked out based on,

625
00:31:26.190 --> 00:31:28.410
on something. We had been
told a little bit by

626
00:31:28.410 --> 00:31:31.290
Microsoft. Oh, I see. So
when you, when they, when

627
00:31:31.290 --> 00:31:33.390
you started asking enough questions
and they started to get

628
00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:36.420
like, put it together, they
were like, Hey, you know,

629
00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.010
we got this thing coming
out. You might want to

630
00:31:38.770 --> 00:31:42.210
line it up. That's pretty
cool. Yeah. It was great

631
00:31:42.210 --> 00:31:43.860
for us. And I think,
I think it ended up

632
00:31:43.890 --> 00:31:46.110
helping them too. So, And
it works good on a

633
00:31:46.110 --> 00:31:48.740
surface three. Like it's a
less powered machine. If I,

634
00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:51.120
if I have a student
or I a, a relative

635
00:31:51.120 --> 00:31:52.860
who is, you know, high
school or college student who

636
00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:55.530
wants to do this, a
surface three plus staff pad

637
00:31:55.530 --> 00:31:57.660
would be a good environment
for them to compose music.

638
00:31:57.690 --> 00:32:00.720
Yeah. So I I've actually
been able to, to test

639
00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:03.510
a little bit on a
development surface three and, and

640
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:07.140
it seems to work pretty
well on there. It's starts

641
00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:08.880
having a little bit of
performance issues, you know, when

642
00:32:08.880 --> 00:32:11.130
you get to much larger
scores. So if you're dealing

643
00:32:11.130 --> 00:32:14.190
with seven, 10 instruments and
you try to play back,

644
00:32:14.190 --> 00:32:17.220
all those playing fast notes
at once the sound library

645
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:18.720
is really going to be
digging up a lot. And

646
00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:19.920
so we're trying to work
and see if we can

647
00:32:19.920 --> 00:32:23.910
even improve that performance. I
see. But presumably you could

648
00:32:23.910 --> 00:32:25.320
render it and then play
it and then it would

649
00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.130
work. Yeah. So we, we
might be able to preprocess,

650
00:32:29.130 --> 00:32:31.410
we might be able to
reload a preload, some, some

651
00:32:31.410 --> 00:32:34.080
of the information and, and
work on that. It's kind

652
00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.870
of a trade off on,
on what makes sense. What

653
00:32:36.870 --> 00:32:39.120
are the resources that staff
had uses that it uses

654
00:32:39.140 --> 00:32:41.450
the most? Is it CPU
bound or is it memory

655
00:32:41.450 --> 00:32:43.970
heavy? Like it's doing work
and I'm not implying it

656
00:32:43.970 --> 00:32:46.070
all in any way that
it's bloated. I'm saying that

657
00:32:46.070 --> 00:32:48.410
it does a lot of
work. What kind of work

658
00:32:48.410 --> 00:32:50.680
does it do? Yeah. So
I think there's, there's a

659
00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:54.640
couple different categories of the
things that are probably most

660
00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:59.110
resource-intensive. One is the playback.
One is the graphics and

661
00:32:59.110 --> 00:33:03.010
then one is the recognition.
And so the, the playback

662
00:33:03.010 --> 00:33:05.020
is a mix of memory
because we're loading in a

663
00:33:05.020 --> 00:33:07.570
lot of samples so we
can access them very quickly.

664
00:33:08.350 --> 00:33:09.880
So, so it's kind of
a mix of memory and

665
00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:13.990
CPU there. The rendering is
really CPU heavy and then

666
00:33:14.110 --> 00:33:17.950
the recognition is just kind
of bleak, brief little bits

667
00:33:17.950 --> 00:33:20.740
of, of CPU heaviness. So
we, we try to, precompute

668
00:33:20.740 --> 00:33:25.240
sambal. You just, can't quite
precompute everything before we, we

669
00:33:25.240 --> 00:33:26.530
have to move on to
the next bar and it

670
00:33:26.530 --> 00:33:29.860
decides to recognize right. Then
I see. So you can't,

671
00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:32.320
it's not like a rendering
in the sense of wait

672
00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:34.780
five minutes and then I'll
play this thing for five

673
00:33:34.780 --> 00:33:38.020
minutes. You render in play
and you kind of buffer

674
00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.670
and render and play and
buffer and under play so

675
00:33:39.670 --> 00:33:42.500
that you can start playing
as quickly as possible. Yeah.

676
00:33:43.300 --> 00:33:45.070
I suppose to the user,
it just feels like they

677
00:33:45.070 --> 00:33:47.580
push play and it starts
playing. Exactly. And so we

678
00:33:47.580 --> 00:33:49.630
agreed can preload a little
bit of stuff, but really

679
00:33:49.630 --> 00:33:54.370
it's mostly, preloading the samples
in first. Very cool. And

680
00:33:54.370 --> 00:34:00.160
this is all@staphpad.net and really
currently, and only on the

681
00:34:00.160 --> 00:34:05.110
windows, the windows store. Absolutely.
Yeah. We, and again, it's,

682
00:34:05.110 --> 00:34:07.060
it's one of those things
where there's not another device

683
00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:09.040
out there really that supports
pen and touch. And I,

684
00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:12.010
I'm not a windows of
Angela start. So it's, it's,

685
00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.230
it's definitely not me. I
can be in paid by

686
00:34:14.230 --> 00:34:16.750
Microsoft or anything. I just,
it's, it's amazing that it's

687
00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:19.930
this device out there that
really kind of seamlessly blends

688
00:34:19.930 --> 00:34:21.700
those two together in a,
in a really useful way.

689
00:34:22.510 --> 00:34:24.940
And you didn't have any
issues with the pen, like

690
00:34:24.940 --> 00:34:27.550
the pen did and worked
exactly as it's supposed to

691
00:34:27.550 --> 00:34:28.990
work and you treat it
as a pan. Like you

692
00:34:28.990 --> 00:34:31.210
can tell the difference between
when the pen is touching

693
00:34:31.210 --> 00:34:34.360
the screen and when your
fingers touching the screen. And

694
00:34:34.360 --> 00:34:37.600
that's actually one of the
big keys that is the

695
00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:39.910
reason we couldn't do it
on something like an iPad.

696
00:34:40.870 --> 00:34:44.320
Ah, that depends on the
iPad really aren't well, first

697
00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:46.660
of all, they don't, they
don't have the performance that

698
00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.970
the, the windows pens have
just let out, So they're

699
00:34:51.970 --> 00:34:55.600
not pens. And then it
can't really tell technically, unless

700
00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.390
you have like something like
the paper, there's a company

701
00:34:58.390 --> 00:35:00.670
called paper and they have
an actual custom Bluetooth pen

702
00:35:00.670 --> 00:35:05.350
called a pencil creatively named
those things are basically their

703
00:35:05.350 --> 00:35:07.780
own custom thing. But most
stylist is in an iPad

704
00:35:07.780 --> 00:35:11.470
or just a little tiny
fingers. Exactly. They're just duplicated

705
00:35:11.470 --> 00:35:13.390
in the fingers. And so
then you can't be drawing

706
00:35:13.390 --> 00:35:16.990
and then instantly scrolling, like
drawing with your pen and

707
00:35:16.990 --> 00:35:19.420
scrolling with your fingers that
just doesn't can't tell those

708
00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:22.150
parts. Yeah. Yeah. The demo
video at staff, pat.net is

709
00:35:22.150 --> 00:35:26.050
really crazy because you're, the
person is basically moving the

710
00:35:26.050 --> 00:35:28.420
pen, flips it over, use
it, the eraser then uses

711
00:35:28.420 --> 00:35:32.170
their finger and basically has
three different interaction models within

712
00:35:32.170 --> 00:35:36.190
seconds. And it's extremely natural
and very different from, from

713
00:35:36.190 --> 00:35:40.350
doing something only touch. Exactly.
Very cool. Thanks so much

714
00:35:40.350 --> 00:35:42.690
for chatting with me today.
I really appreciate it. Oh,

715
00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:44.070
thank you so much for
having me on the show.

716
00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:47.100
This has been another episode
of Hanselminutes and we'll see

717
00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.060
you again next week.
