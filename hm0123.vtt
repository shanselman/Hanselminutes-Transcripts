this episode, Scott talks social
networking with Daria Boston, Joe.

9
00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:04.670
Hi, this is Scott Hanselman
and this is another episode

10
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:06.650
of Hansel minutes. And I'm
sitting here today at Microsoft

11
00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:11.210
corporation on campus in Seattle
with Dari. Obasanjo a program

12
00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.960
manager on the windows live
team. Yes. Thanks for sitting

13
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:16.190
down with me today. I
know you're a busy guy

14
00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:18.080
and you've got a only
a little while to talk

15
00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:20.300
to me today. I've been
noticing that you've been blogging

16
00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:23.240
a lot lately about social
networking sites and stuff. I

17
00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:26.000
know you're on Facebook and
Twitter. And what other sites

18
00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.660
do you do you use
Actually don't I don't use

19
00:01:29.660 --> 00:01:33.770
that many, like a Facebook,
Twitter friend feed. Oh yeah.

20
00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.980
I use friend feed a
flicker. I dunno. Flicker is

21
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.200
a social networking Council. It's
turning into one, isn't it?

22
00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:41.540
I mean, they have enough
feeds. I'm finding it really

23
00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.020
difficult to manage all of
this kind of, I guess

24
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:46.820
you could call it content.
It's not really. It's like

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:49.820
flotsam and jetsam. It's not
really content, but producing all

26
00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:53.270
this stuff and it's all
available via an RSS feed,

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:56.360
but it's ultimately just turning
into a river of news

28
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.740
that I can't really consume
fast enough, like Twitter, I've

29
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.230
got like 300 people that
I follow, but ultimately it's

30
00:02:03.230 --> 00:02:05.330
just like the top five
tweets that I happened to

31
00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.510
look at at that moment
is this flood of information

32
00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:10.340
going to become a problem.
Are there any ways to

33
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:14.240
manage that? I mean, it's
just smart filtering agents. What

34
00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.740
are some, what are some
ways for us to manage

35
00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:17.120
all of this? Because I
see that we're putting lots

36
00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.240
of APIs on top of
this flood of content, but

37
00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:22.580
I don't feel like there's
a, I don't feel like

38
00:02:22.580 --> 00:02:26.030
it's necessarily gaining any control
over this mess. I'm curious

39
00:02:26.030 --> 00:02:28.340
if you have any thoughts
about that. I don't know.

40
00:02:28.340 --> 00:02:30.020
Like I look at what
it's like some of the

41
00:02:30.020 --> 00:02:33.920
stuff that Facebook has done
where it seems like, well,

42
00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:35.660
cause I don't know for
a fact it seems like

43
00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.210
they try to make sure
you see the most relevant

44
00:02:38.210 --> 00:02:42.740
content from your friends, depending
for some value of relevant.

45
00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.420
Yes. Speaking as a user.
I mean, we're both as

46
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.080
users. Yeah. So as we
get as a user, it

47
00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:51.500
seems that they do that
as a user. You know,

48
00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:55.670
like I I've always found
that interesting because it's hard.

49
00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:58.970
Like without being able to
read my mind. Yeah. You

50
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.530
know what the most relevant
content is to me, They

51
00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:04.290
get that like thumbs up,
thumbs down TiVo thing, or

52
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:05.610
they got rid of it.
They got rid of that.

53
00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:07.290
Now, how do you tell
people that you care about

54
00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:09.820
a particular piece of content
You don't, because that was,

55
00:03:10.180 --> 00:03:13.140
that was, that was actually
pretty ambiguous because when you

56
00:03:13.140 --> 00:03:16.860
thumbed something up, it couldn't
tell if you, well, it

57
00:03:16.860 --> 00:03:19.920
wasn't clear if you were
thumbing up the person, that

58
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.510
type of content or that
particular piece of content. Like

59
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:28.590
if I thumbed up a
photo, that's got to have

60
00:03:28.590 --> 00:03:32.610
a transformers movie. Right. It's
not clear where they're like,

61
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:35.820
I like transformers. I like
Scott or I like photos

62
00:03:36.630 --> 00:03:38.460
And that's kind of like
a classic usability problem. Cause

63
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.350
like on the TiVo, you
know, if I like to

64
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:42.930
watch, you know, America's next
top model and I give

65
00:03:42.930 --> 00:03:44.880
it a thumbs up, suddenly
I get the tire bank

66
00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.060
show and queer eye. Oh
yeah. I've had that happen.

67
00:03:48.090 --> 00:03:50.970
And TiVo was like, no
bad TiVo, bad. I don't

68
00:03:50.970 --> 00:03:54.510
want to watch that. But,
but at the same time,

69
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.340
I don't think that my
wife or my mom really

70
00:03:56.340 --> 00:03:59.640
wants to go and put
in a if transformers and

71
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:03.360
not Scott and Dari and
you know, no one's going

72
00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:05.490
to build queries. So it
seems like the usability problem

73
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:08.280
is a thumbs up thumbs
down on one side of

74
00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:14.950
the spectrum or, you know,
sequel for Facebook. Yeah. The

75
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:19.140
one thing I've been trying
recently is a Pandora. Is

76
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:22.200
that the, the music suggestion?
Yeah. So Pandora actually like

77
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.930
again, they just have a
thumbs up thumbs down interface,

78
00:04:25.290 --> 00:04:28.080
but somehow they figured out
like, at least for music,

79
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:31.140
it does like a pretty
excellent job of figuring out

80
00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:33.720
like what you eventually like
and what you don't like.

81
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.150
But they, they, they claimed
to have put in a

82
00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:38.040
lot of work into it.
They claim like for every

83
00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.950
song they have on there,
they have musicians who have

84
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:45.090
tracked over a hundred qualities
of that song. Really. You

85
00:04:45.090 --> 00:04:47.700
know, there was a thing
called mood logic. If you

86
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:49.500
remember that it was called
the mood logic and it

87
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.010
was an iTunes looking, you
know, Chrome thing that you

88
00:04:53.010 --> 00:04:57.360
would run. And it had
slider bars where they would

89
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:00.090
basically look at it. They
would look at a song

90
00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:02.190
and they'd calculate like a
hash like the Kayla SHA

91
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.470
one hash of your MP3.
And then for every Shai,

92
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:06.780
one hash, they would say,
Oh, well he's got this,

93
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:08.220
but it was more of
an audio hash. It wasn't

94
00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:10.620
the actual bites. It was
like, yeah, it's clear that

95
00:05:10.860 --> 00:05:13.980
we're both listening to Nora
Jones, but it's, they're not

96
00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:16.560
the exact same file. And
then you would in mood

97
00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:19.650
logic, draw the slider bar
and you'd go happy, sad,

98
00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:22.950
upbeat, downbeat, low tempo mid-tempo
and they had some heuristics,

99
00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:26.250
but it's only like eight
or nine options. And they

100
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:29.070
would charge you like 20
bucks to opt into this

101
00:05:29.070 --> 00:05:31.650
thing. And then it would
kind of fix your, this

102
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:33.960
was like three, four, five
years ago, even a long

103
00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.810
time ago. Yeah. And the
problem with that, which is

104
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:39.630
like the classic usability problem
and what Pandora's and I

105
00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.990
figured out how to get
around, is it nobody cares

106
00:05:42.990 --> 00:05:46.410
enough to micromanage your tastes
that well, exactly. There's no

107
00:05:46.410 --> 00:05:48.840
user, who's going to show
up and say, you know

108
00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:52.470
what? I have, I follow
50 people on Twitter. I'm

109
00:05:52.470 --> 00:05:56.070
going to rank them. All
right. No, my best friend.

110
00:05:56.100 --> 00:05:58.430
Cause that's what you read
as a software element. That's

111
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:00.530
what you really want. And
you want like, Hey, I

112
00:06:00.530 --> 00:06:03.530
really like Scott. I really
like Omar and Mike, you

113
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:07.850
know, tech crunch, if there's
nothing else, right? Like that's

114
00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:10.420
what that's that's right. Yeah.
But that's, that's a sixth

115
00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:12.160
grade thing to do. Right.
In sixth grade, we all

116
00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:14.530
write down our best friend
and our best, best friend,

117
00:06:15.070 --> 00:06:17.200
but adults are not going
to micromanage their life to

118
00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.710
that level. And until we
can fix, figure out how

119
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:23.260
to fix the usability gap,
that's always going to be

120
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:26.200
a problem. Pandora Pandora's figure
like figure it out that

121
00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.970
there was no way you
could get users to do

122
00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:32.050
it. But the set of
like popular music is finite.

123
00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:34.000
Like it's not like a
massive, like, you know, the

124
00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:37.630
songs in the top 200
and on the billboard charts,

125
00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:40.030
maybe there are a couple
hundred songs a year. Right.

126
00:06:40.030 --> 00:06:42.250
So you could probably get
some folks to sit down

127
00:06:42.460 --> 00:06:44.290
and try and figure out
what all the qualities of

128
00:06:44.290 --> 00:06:46.450
these songs are. Right, right,
right. But on the other

129
00:06:46.450 --> 00:06:47.860
hand, like who's going to
sit down and figure out

130
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:51.280
what all the qualities of
scribbles tweets are. Yeah. Isn't

131
00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:53.110
that when crowdsourcing, I mean,
one of the things everyone's

132
00:06:53.110 --> 00:06:55.690
talking about is crowdsourcing likes
the game spore that everyone's

133
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.450
talking about. The new electronic
arts game is a, it's

134
00:06:58.450 --> 00:07:01.930
like a creature creator game.
And it's built in such

135
00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:03.190
a way that there's can
be an infinite number of

136
00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:05.620
creatures. So how are they
going to see this world

137
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.830
with creatures? They can't possibly
hire a people or even

138
00:07:08.830 --> 00:07:11.500
outsource this kind of stuff.
So they do crowdsourcing, they

139
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:16.390
made it fun. And then
they make the spore creature

140
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:18.070
creator. And I guess they've
had like a million or

141
00:07:18.070 --> 00:07:21.850
a million and a half
unique creatures created not random,

142
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:25.510
but crafted like by people
who care. And then I

143
00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:27.730
heard that there was a
capture. I forget the name

144
00:07:27.730 --> 00:07:29.710
of it. I thought it
was like something capture, recapture,

145
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:34.120
recapture. They give you words
and they basically give you

146
00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:37.690
a capture widget and JavaScript.
And you're actually digitizing books

147
00:07:37.690 --> 00:07:40.690
that have been scanned in.
So you could, you could

148
00:07:40.690 --> 00:07:43.180
say that what friend feed
is doing is something similar

149
00:07:43.180 --> 00:07:46.870
to that. Like traditionally people
have tried to use, I've

150
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:50.740
used crowdsourcing on like, like
finite sets of content. Like

151
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:54.370
what Amazon does. It's pretty
much crowdsourced mechanical Turk like

152
00:07:54.730 --> 00:07:57.520
mechanical Turk, or even just
your ratings because you have,

153
00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.250
you know, you have, I
have some song if by

154
00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:03.190
the time 150 people have
rated it, there's some sort

155
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:05.770
of quality you can, you
can go 150 people have

156
00:08:05.770 --> 00:08:09.850
rated it. They'll also highlight
the most negative, the most

157
00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:13.450
voted on negative. Or I
love that feature most voted

158
00:08:13.450 --> 00:08:16.630
on positive and between the
rating and the most vote

159
00:08:16.630 --> 00:08:18.370
on positive and negative, you
can see the pros and

160
00:08:18.370 --> 00:08:20.890
cons and kind of the
general weight of the song.

161
00:08:20.920 --> 00:08:24.880
Yeah. Where like it breaks
down for social content is

162
00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.790
that you're not going to
get like a hundred people

163
00:08:28.090 --> 00:08:30.760
voting on every single tweet
that you see every bit

164
00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:35.080
of content that you see
in Twitter or Facebook, but

165
00:08:35.110 --> 00:08:38.740
friend feed with the like
feature they do get like

166
00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.990
people there's a low friction
way where people can go,

167
00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:44.710
Hey, here's this key, this
piece of content is cool.

168
00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:47.140
And with the way, the
fact that they kind of

169
00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:51.310
bubble up the stuff that
you like, there's a chance,

170
00:08:51.970 --> 00:08:56.310
although small, that if enough
in your network, like it,

171
00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:59.280
you know, you'll probably like
it too. Right. And if

172
00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:01.530
there's a whole bunch of
content, we bubble up the

173
00:09:01.530 --> 00:09:03.870
stuff that people in your
network have thought was interesting.

174
00:09:04.410 --> 00:09:06.870
And that's how they're trying
to address the kind of

175
00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:09.690
the flooding noise problem. Yeah.
And I think I don't,

176
00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:12.180
I haven't used it. I
haven't used the service long

177
00:09:12.180 --> 00:09:17.400
enough to see if, how
that scales for non-gay content.

178
00:09:18.200 --> 00:09:20.760
Because the problem with your
current user base is that

179
00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.980
the kind of content they
share, this is kind of

180
00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:26.460
content that lots of people,
you know, would care about

181
00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:29.220
rating. Like, well, I just
would care about rating. It's

182
00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:31.860
pretty objective to rate, to
like lots of people would,

183
00:09:32.100 --> 00:09:35.220
it's easy for lots of
people to rate a video

184
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:38.280
that's global posted up or
an article on tech crunch.

185
00:09:38.610 --> 00:09:41.310
When you get to like
more intimate social information, like

186
00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:45.060
Debbie change her status message.
And Bob threw up some

187
00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.570
baby photos and Kevin just
wrote a wall posts. Right.

188
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:51.030
How do you get, like,
how do you get the

189
00:09:51.030 --> 00:09:54.090
crowd to rate that step
for me? How do you,

190
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:57.290
You throw a Reddit and
no one, no one shows

191
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.870
up. Did you really have
Reddit? Yeah. Are we at

192
00:09:59.870 --> 00:10:00.860
it? I'm not sure I
can just read it. Right?

193
00:10:02.270 --> 00:10:04.310
Yeah. It's like, no, I
think what you said about

194
00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:07.280
non geek related content. I
mean, there's like dig and

195
00:10:07.280 --> 00:10:09.200
there's Reddit and they're all
basically the same thing. It's

196
00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:12.650
the idea of downloading something
and saying, I like that.

197
00:10:12.920 --> 00:10:16.010
I don't like that barrier
for, for all kinds of

198
00:10:16.010 --> 00:10:20.690
content. Right. And when there's
enough people, a blockbuster or

199
00:10:20.690 --> 00:10:24.590
a Netflix can start to
exploit that, that knowledge, but

200
00:10:24.590 --> 00:10:27.380
this is all either geek
related where it, meaning we

201
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.290
care deeply enough about it,
like Reddit or it's popular

202
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:35.450
culture related like a movie,
but for regular Joes, like

203
00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:38.690
the content on like about.com,
right. Which is a huge

204
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:42.140
pile of content. That's basically
like a Wikipedia style. You

205
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.380
know, it's a, it's a
pile of two or three

206
00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.470
people are deeply interested in
this particular topic. And those

207
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:50.360
two or three people will
argue about it and get

208
00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.420
that out there. But two
or three isn't enough sample

209
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.370
size for me to have
any confidence in either the

210
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.630
quality or relevance of that
particular chunk of content. Yes.

211
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:02.270
And it gets worse when
it's like personal content, right?

212
00:11:02.270 --> 00:11:05.330
Like where, you know, like
the two or three people

213
00:11:05.330 --> 00:11:07.790
are like, you know, the
person's mom and your cousin

214
00:11:07.850 --> 00:11:10.100
and maybe you, because you
went high school with them

215
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:13.500
who determines if that content
is more interesting than some

216
00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:15.440
more, some other content from
somebody who you went to

217
00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:19.100
high school with. Yeah. Right.
So for the friend feeds

218
00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:23.090
model, it's interesting. But I,
I wonder if it can

219
00:11:23.330 --> 00:11:26.960
with its scales when they
don't have a geek audience.

220
00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:29.720
I like, cause they've, they've
always, they've talked about being

221
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:32.330
a household name. So, and
if there were a household

222
00:11:32.330 --> 00:11:36.200
name like Facebook and Facebook
is wild because I'm, I'm

223
00:11:36.200 --> 00:11:40.040
always amazed by who I
see on Facebook. Like there's,

224
00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.020
you know, people, I went
to high school in Nigeria

225
00:11:42.020 --> 00:11:45.830
with there's some guy who
dated. So I was just

226
00:11:45.830 --> 00:11:49.400
friended by some girl who
dated a friend of mine

227
00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:52.790
when he was like in
the 10th grade. Right. Like,

228
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.870
like how do you, how
do you, like when that's

229
00:11:55.870 --> 00:11:58.390
your user base, how do
you make sure like the

230
00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:02.140
most relevant stuff from the
people around them? Right. It's

231
00:12:02.140 --> 00:12:05.380
one thing when it's a
user base that has content

232
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:10.810
that that is easily objective
objectively or semi objectively rated,

233
00:12:10.810 --> 00:12:14.380
like when it's an article
it's global road or, you

234
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:19.120
know, a Google video about,
or YouTube video about some

235
00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.400
event or some happening, it's
easy for a bunch of

236
00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:23.050
people to go, okay, this
is, this is funnier than

237
00:12:23.050 --> 00:12:27.430
that. Right. But when it's
personal content and it's a

238
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:30.120
lot of, it's a lot
of personal content You're saying

239
00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:33.120
on Facebook that you're getting
friended by people from way,

240
00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.310
way back in your life.
Like, and it's becoming so

241
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:37.800
popular. My dad knows what
Facebook, which is almost enough

242
00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:41.130
to make Facebook not cool.
My wife would not get

243
00:12:41.130 --> 00:12:43.200
on Facebook for the longest
time. Like, you've got to

244
00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:44.430
go on Facebook, you got
to go and fit. She's

245
00:12:44.430 --> 00:12:47.130
finding like fifth grade, sixth
grade people and they're having

246
00:12:47.130 --> 00:12:48.900
chats and stuff. And they're
putting stuff on their wall

247
00:12:49.260 --> 00:12:54.440
in Facebook, but it's not
in any way of like,

248
00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.030
like they put up a
rap video that was specific

249
00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:59.100
to the town and the
neighborhood that she grew up

250
00:12:59.100 --> 00:13:02.880
in Zimbabwe. So her tiny
little slice of like people

251
00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:05.880
who went to girl's college
in this neighborhood, you know,

252
00:13:05.910 --> 00:13:09.960
in between 90 and 93
care about this content, that

253
00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.990
is our target audience. It's
like that, that scene in

254
00:13:12.990 --> 00:13:15.060
the nerd with Steve Martin,
where it's like, if you,

255
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:17.670
if you, when you get,
you know, between the left

256
00:13:17.670 --> 00:13:19.440
side of the Kewpie doll
and the right of here

257
00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.910
and the third shelf down
and you know, and he

258
00:13:20.910 --> 00:13:24.030
basically comes down to you
when these Chiclets out of

259
00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:27.420
all of this amazing stuff,
they don't need to be

260
00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.560
downloading or uploading their content.
That's the one place where

261
00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:34.480
the crowdsourcing model, I don't
see how the crowdsourcing model

262
00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:36.990
works. Like you really want,
like, cause it's your wife,

263
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:39.980
that content is, is really
personally relevant, but no matter

264
00:13:40.010 --> 00:13:42.270
like how many people you
get to vote on it,

265
00:13:42.510 --> 00:13:44.070
in fact, getting lots of
people to vote on it

266
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:47.460
may actually give you the,
the, the opposite from what

267
00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:49.710
you want, because lots of
people are download it. Yeah,

268
00:13:49.710 --> 00:13:51.210
exactly. Like if you actually
opened it up and said,

269
00:13:51.210 --> 00:13:54.840
here's my, here's my feed
stream, please Ahmad and download

270
00:13:55.440 --> 00:13:57.120
All of these things. Also
bring up a really interesting

271
00:13:57.120 --> 00:13:59.010
concept because we want to
make the idea and we're

272
00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.260
using the term uploading and
downloading is a vote of

273
00:14:01.260 --> 00:14:03.270
confidence or a vote of
no confidence for those of

274
00:14:03.270 --> 00:14:06.630
you aren't into the social
parlance. But the idea that

275
00:14:06.990 --> 00:14:09.570
we want to make it
effortless, right? Like one of

276
00:14:09.570 --> 00:14:12.000
the things I really like
right now is user voice.com

277
00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.450
or get satisfaction.com. They let
you vote for a feature

278
00:14:15.450 --> 00:14:18.800
in a product effortlessly without
logging in. And that, that

279
00:14:18.810 --> 00:14:21.870
right there is the that's
the barrier. But then you

280
00:14:21.870 --> 00:14:24.750
get people making, dig bots
and Reddit bots to try

281
00:14:24.750 --> 00:14:26.970
to artificially upload and download
stuff. So then there's a

282
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:29.730
whole class of really interesting
problems about determining whether this

283
00:14:29.730 --> 00:14:32.790
is a human being cheating
or not. But then there's

284
00:14:32.790 --> 00:14:36.210
the issue of trust. I'm
starting to distrust the social

285
00:14:36.210 --> 00:14:39.150
networking sites more and more
like I recently logged into

286
00:14:39.150 --> 00:14:41.670
a social networking site. I
actually won't mention because they

287
00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:44.370
they're very kind and they
fix this problem, but it

288
00:14:44.370 --> 00:14:47.610
said, you know, welcome to
our, our website. Hey, you,

289
00:14:47.650 --> 00:14:50.820
you probably use LinkedIn. Tell
us about your LinkedIn account.

290
00:14:50.930 --> 00:14:53.240
And we'll find out which
of your LinkedIn friends are

291
00:14:53.240 --> 00:14:55.790
using this thing. And I
was like, Oh, that's so

292
00:14:55.790 --> 00:14:59.180
helpful. So like a schmuck
I put in my LinkedIn

293
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:03.140
password and then, you know,
1200 spam emails later and

294
00:15:03.140 --> 00:15:06.170
like three irate phone calls.
Like, why are you sending

295
00:15:06.170 --> 00:15:08.540
me this crap? And then
of course, and then actually

296
00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.140
what happened was so many
people from my, my 1200

297
00:15:12.140 --> 00:15:15.470
person, LinkedIn database signed up
for their thing that it

298
00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.620
overloaded, like the, for loop,
the straight four loop that

299
00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.530
they wrote to like display
that page. I crashed their

300
00:15:21.530 --> 00:15:24.500
server and they sent said,
yes, that was, you know,

301
00:15:24.530 --> 00:15:26.720
not intent, no one intends
to do this. I don't

302
00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:28.490
think like, I don't think
they're really do. I mean,

303
00:15:28.490 --> 00:15:30.320
do you think that they're
sitting around going, here's how

304
00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:33.530
we're going to spread virally.
I hope so. Really that's

305
00:15:33.530 --> 00:15:37.570
evil though. So the thing
that I, I would just

306
00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:39.730
assume that they had just
made a mistake. Like, I

307
00:15:39.730 --> 00:15:41.620
mean, there's a, there are
lots of like talks. And

308
00:15:41.620 --> 00:15:43.240
if you, if you look
at a lot of these

309
00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:46.270
web conferences, there are lots
of tracks and sessions about

310
00:15:46.270 --> 00:15:51.160
viral marketing and viral advertising.
So, so a lot of

311
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.370
people think when you think
about a Facebook platform applications,

312
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:58.060
like I like, and Flixster
are held up as really,

313
00:15:58.060 --> 00:16:01.870
really successful apps. And why?
Because they spread virally, Is

314
00:16:01.870 --> 00:16:03.160
it isn't it, but isn't
it now because they were

315
00:16:03.160 --> 00:16:05.920
the first ones and now
people, I mean, everyone wants

316
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.280
to spread virally. Well, Well,
they were the first ones

317
00:16:09.460 --> 00:16:12.970
and they, they, they started
at a time before Facebook

318
00:16:12.970 --> 00:16:15.520
realized that spreading rarely was
going to be such a

319
00:16:15.520 --> 00:16:20.470
problem. And since then, especially
in Facebook's case, they've done

320
00:16:20.470 --> 00:16:23.260
a lot of things to
stop applications from spreading rarely.

321
00:16:23.530 --> 00:16:27.310
But the fact is that
when applications spread virally, it

322
00:16:27.550 --> 00:16:31.180
increases your user base. Because
as you said, even though

323
00:16:31.430 --> 00:16:33.790
the application was rude and
span 12 hundreds of your

324
00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:36.310
friends, they got a bunch
of users, enough people signed

325
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:39.160
up from your 1200 friends
to crash your site. Right?

326
00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:41.800
So it's like this it's
like, Scott thinks we're a

327
00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:46.090
jerk, but we just got
a hundred new users. Right.

328
00:16:46.300 --> 00:16:49.450
And even if Scott leaves,
I bet even if, just

329
00:16:49.450 --> 00:16:52.000
half of Scott's friends say
that's still a win, win,

330
00:16:54.070 --> 00:16:56.170
win, win. It's still a
win like this. They still

331
00:16:56.170 --> 00:16:59.740
come out ahead. And that's,
that's why that happens. And

332
00:16:59.740 --> 00:17:03.160
it's, it's unfortunate, but it'll
continue to happen is the

333
00:17:03.160 --> 00:17:05.630
same way spam is around.
Right. Yeah. As long as

334
00:17:05.630 --> 00:17:08.290
there are people who respond,
respond to that kind of

335
00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:12.970
Solicitation. Yeah. Yeah. It's interesting
because there's, I think that

336
00:17:12.970 --> 00:17:15.220
there's, there's karma though. And
I really believe in karma

337
00:17:15.220 --> 00:17:16.960
in all things. Like I
was joking with a guy

338
00:17:16.960 --> 00:17:20.050
yesterday that if you tip
better at red, we were

339
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:21.970
at red Robin. If you
tip better at Robin, I

340
00:17:21.970 --> 00:17:24.010
believe that you will get
better parking at the mall.

341
00:17:24.100 --> 00:17:25.720
I've always believed that, you
know, like, so I tip

342
00:17:25.750 --> 00:17:27.760
and I get awesome parking
spots. I'm like the guy

343
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:30.310
who parked next to the
handicap spot always cause I

344
00:17:30.370 --> 00:17:32.680
tip well. And I think
that these web 2.0 sites

345
00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:34.960
are learning that if you
screw up, it could be

346
00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:38.830
the end. Like Facebook beacon
was a really rough time.

347
00:17:38.830 --> 00:17:41.290
I mean, they, they, they
went around, they fixed it.

348
00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:43.750
But I mean, did you,
did you freak out the

349
00:17:43.750 --> 00:17:46.870
first time you saw a
beacon? So I never saw

350
00:17:46.870 --> 00:17:49.650
it, but I did hear
about it. And I, to

351
00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:52.320
some people here who had
had, who had be, can

352
00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:56.130
show up on blockbuster.com and
it was just such, it

353
00:17:56.130 --> 00:17:58.520
was such an absurd move.
Yeah. I mean, I logged

354
00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:01.700
into blockbuster one morning and
added something to the top

355
00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.790
of my queue and this
little piece of toast and

356
00:18:04.850 --> 00:18:07.640
by toast, I mean that
little box that pops up

357
00:18:07.640 --> 00:18:09.350
the lower right of your
screen pops up and said,

358
00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:13.520
we're sending the information to
Facebook that you like, you

359
00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.860
know, something that you don't
want people to know you

360
00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.100
like or whatever movie you're
renting. And I wanted to

361
00:18:19.100 --> 00:18:21.230
reach into the screen and
snatch that little box of

362
00:18:21.230 --> 00:18:24.020
toast. And I immediately started
digging around Facebook to figure

363
00:18:24.020 --> 00:18:26.210
out what the privacy setting
was to turn that off

364
00:18:26.210 --> 00:18:28.460
and couldn't find it. There
was none when the feature

365
00:18:28.460 --> 00:18:32.000
shipped, which is, which was
really awesome and absurd part.

366
00:18:33.350 --> 00:18:35.420
And I remember you that
you would post something about

367
00:18:35.750 --> 00:18:40.100
people are spamming about not
just join our social network,

368
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:42.610
but maybe information like where
you are. There was a,

369
00:18:42.610 --> 00:18:45.440
a location based spam that
went out to SMS. Recently.

370
00:18:46.610 --> 00:18:48.920
I think the name of
the service is a looped.

371
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:55.250
It's an iPhone app. I
was reading, I forgotten his

372
00:18:55.250 --> 00:18:56.960
blog. I was reading, but
I was reading some blog

373
00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:00.380
maybe in Sarah, Lacey, maybe,
maybe not. Yeah. And it

374
00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:03.100
was about this application that
would an iPhone app. But

375
00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:05.510
that was how it would
look in your phone contact

376
00:19:05.510 --> 00:19:09.740
list and send out messages
saying, Hey, wow, why don't

377
00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:11.720
you try this app? They
can look at your phone

378
00:19:11.720 --> 00:19:13.970
contacts because they're there on
the, Yeah. Because if you're

379
00:19:13.970 --> 00:19:15.980
on the phone, it's like
an API on the phone.

380
00:19:17.090 --> 00:19:18.680
And I didn't realize that
they had that much power.

381
00:19:18.890 --> 00:19:22.220
Yeah. So it's, you know,
it's kind of, because everybody

382
00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:24.710
has phone numbers that you
really have for an emergency.

383
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.120
Like I have like phone
numbers in my phone. I

384
00:19:27.120 --> 00:19:30.740
have phone numbers for our
operations folks, just in case

385
00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:33.460
we have a live site
issue, but it's not, I

386
00:19:33.470 --> 00:19:36.110
would be completely embarrassed if
like some Sunday, while I

387
00:19:36.110 --> 00:19:38.300
was messing around with some
iPhone app, this guy gets

388
00:19:38.300 --> 00:19:40.370
an SMS and it's like,
Hey, yeah. Why don't you

389
00:19:40.370 --> 00:19:42.950
try all this new cool.
Right. Like your dentist gets

390
00:19:43.040 --> 00:19:46.970
spammed from you. Yeah. So
that's, that's, that's exactly what

391
00:19:46.970 --> 00:19:50.480
they did. And again, it's
because they know it's successful.

392
00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:52.400
Like they know like, just
like that side, the spam,

393
00:19:52.410 --> 00:19:54.530
your LinkedIn, The karma though,
that's going to bite them.

394
00:19:54.530 --> 00:19:56.600
I mean, those, the, the,
the, the, the crowd will

395
00:19:56.600 --> 00:19:58.250
turn on them just as
the crowd can help you.

396
00:19:58.250 --> 00:20:01.250
The crowd can, can crush
you quickly. That has happened

397
00:20:01.250 --> 00:20:04.880
to some sites. I believe
a Plaxo Plaxo practice is

398
00:20:04.880 --> 00:20:07.250
an example of a site
that did that to grow.

399
00:20:07.250 --> 00:20:08.720
And then when they knew
we were trying to take

400
00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:10.280
it to the next level,
like, there was just so

401
00:20:10.280 --> 00:20:13.790
much bad karma around Plaxo,
the brand plaques or that.

402
00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.460
Yeah. Do you and I,
you, I thought you were

403
00:20:16.460 --> 00:20:19.310
on more social networking sites
than a, then it turns

404
00:20:19.310 --> 00:20:21.320
out you were at the
beginning, I'd asked you. And

405
00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.910
then I, I'm trying to
realize a lot of them

406
00:20:22.910 --> 00:20:26.300
are duplicates. Like everyone wants
me to join Plaxo pulse,

407
00:20:27.230 --> 00:20:31.400
but isn't that pretty much
LinkedIn Practical policies like LinkedIn,

408
00:20:31.430 --> 00:20:36.590
plus some friend feed like
features. So I am actually,

409
00:20:36.790 --> 00:20:38.790
I try out a lot
of sites, but like, I

410
00:20:38.810 --> 00:20:41.180
don't stick around a lot.
So I'm pretty boring. Like,

411
00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:44.780
I, I use Facebook, I
use Facebook, I use friend

412
00:20:44.780 --> 00:20:48.400
feed. I use Twitter. I
use windows life spaces. Right?

413
00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:54.570
You Zune social. I don't
have, Oh dude. See the

414
00:20:54.570 --> 00:20:56.760
Zune thing. Actually, the student
social is pretty cool, but

415
00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:58.890
I'm trying to figure out
my wife has a zoom

416
00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:03.330
and I have a zoom,
but we're still learning about

417
00:21:03.330 --> 00:21:04.950
how this is supposed to
work. But the idea is

418
00:21:04.950 --> 00:21:07.080
that, you know, the music
that you play can appear

419
00:21:07.620 --> 00:21:11.070
online, but then it becomes
an identity management problem because

420
00:21:11.310 --> 00:21:13.620
we both live in the
same house. I think this

421
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:15.750
is a really interesting thing
that I like about Facebook

422
00:21:15.750 --> 00:21:18.120
is that they know that
we're married. Like you can

423
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:20.340
go up in our profile.
It says, Scott Hanson is married

424
00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:22.920
to, and it appeared as
a, as a piece of

425
00:21:22.920 --> 00:21:24.720
information. So there's, there's something
that can be done about

426
00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:26.670
that. The idea that it's
not just me and my

427
00:21:26.670 --> 00:21:30.420
relationships, but it's my close
relationships. The Zune hasn't quite

428
00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:34.320
figured that out because we
have one zoon pass and

429
00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:38.610
we have two windows live
IDs connected to that zone

430
00:21:38.610 --> 00:21:43.020
pass. But the Zune itself
that we share is connected

431
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.660
to just one of us
at a time. So in

432
00:21:45.660 --> 00:21:48.900
order to make it socially
appear on FA on Facebook,

433
00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:52.290
that I'm listening to these
songs, I have to, I

434
00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:55.950
think, login to the Zune
as myself, nuke the zoon,

435
00:21:55.950 --> 00:21:59.130
resync all my content, listen
to the songs, then sync

436
00:21:59.130 --> 00:22:01.350
again for the play list.
You know, so it's this

437
00:22:01.350 --> 00:22:03.540
whole kind of thing. And
I think it's, it's very

438
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:06.660
complicated just in order to,
to show that the husband

439
00:22:06.660 --> 00:22:10.140
is listening to the shared
zone pass. And it got

440
00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:14.520
me thinking about whether social
networking sites will take close,

441
00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:19.650
close, close relationships, family, secondary
family versus acquaintances, because a

442
00:22:19.650 --> 00:22:22.770
lot of people on Facebook
and my acquaintances as a

443
00:22:22.770 --> 00:22:27.210
weight into the decision making
that they make and linking

444
00:22:27.210 --> 00:22:31.920
these things together. So I've,
I've actually talked to people

445
00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.790
about this quite a bit.
The interesting, the interesting thing

446
00:22:35.790 --> 00:22:39.840
about that is I believe
Facebook also recently just did

447
00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:44.430
a thing, a feature called
a friendless friend lists. So

448
00:22:44.430 --> 00:22:47.100
that's separate from your friends.
Yes. You can actually categorize

449
00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.240
your friends now into like
different friends. Oh, right, right.

450
00:22:49.350 --> 00:22:51.060
Cause I there's like limited
profile is the one I'm

451
00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:53.370
familiar with. There's only profile,
but you can also put

452
00:22:53.370 --> 00:22:55.920
them in any categories you
want, like family, coworkers, friends.

453
00:22:55.920 --> 00:22:59.100
And so on the reason
to do this would be

454
00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:02.280
if it would be, if
you were the class of

455
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:06.330
users who have this problem
are users, usually adults cause

456
00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:10.410
Facebook Facebook's primary problem kind
of is it started off

457
00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:14.130
with high schoolers and college
students, people who tend to

458
00:23:14.130 --> 00:23:16.620
live in one particular social
class. Right. And you would

459
00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:21.000
join Facebook by going to
like vassar.facebook.com. Yes. And so

460
00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.910
you only have like your
college friends and you and

461
00:23:23.910 --> 00:23:25.890
your mom and dad were
on Facebook and that was

462
00:23:25.890 --> 00:23:28.710
it. So you only had
this one social context. The

463
00:23:28.710 --> 00:23:31.080
people that started having problems
with Facebook are people, I

464
00:23:31.080 --> 00:23:33.270
guess like you and me,
people who have, who now

465
00:23:33.270 --> 00:23:37.770
have people. I went to
school with my coworkers, people,

466
00:23:37.770 --> 00:23:40.140
you know, who I'm, who
I'm in little league with

467
00:23:40.410 --> 00:23:43.210
who's people whose kids are
in little league. And then,

468
00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:46.400
and then you want to
manage and some social Networking

469
00:23:46.400 --> 00:23:48.740
sites just call that groups.
And they have a little

470
00:23:48.740 --> 00:23:50.420
club that you joined. But
I think that the way

471
00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:53.690
you phrase it, social context
is not necessarily a group,

472
00:23:53.690 --> 00:23:56.420
a group might be a,
a dark line that I

473
00:23:56.420 --> 00:23:58.220
can draw around a group
of people. But a social

474
00:23:58.220 --> 00:24:01.030
context is more of a
dotted line. Yes. And, and

475
00:24:01.030 --> 00:24:03.370
managing social context. And the
tricky thing about managing social

476
00:24:03.370 --> 00:24:06.070
context is that it's not
for every user or social

477
00:24:06.070 --> 00:24:09.580
network. I like, again, a
college student. I, I have

478
00:24:09.580 --> 00:24:12.430
some college buddies, you know,
like my mom and dad

479
00:24:12.430 --> 00:24:15.160
aren't on here. They don't
have to manage that. But

480
00:24:15.160 --> 00:24:17.620
once, you know, once you're
alive, once you have, well,

481
00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:22.030
I have my, my college
buddies who, you know, Who,

482
00:24:22.390 --> 00:24:25.450
who send me wacky photos.
And that's cool to have

483
00:24:25.450 --> 00:24:27.250
a relationship with that. Yeah.
But I also have like

484
00:24:27.250 --> 00:24:29.440
my boss and his boss
and our VP on my

485
00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:31.870
friend list and I don't
want them interacting on my

486
00:24:31.870 --> 00:24:35.050
wall. Right. Cause you know,
when you, like, when you,

487
00:24:35.170 --> 00:24:38.050
when you first get in
a relationship like your first

488
00:24:38.050 --> 00:24:41.950
serious relationship, the, in my
opinion, the first challenge is

489
00:24:41.950 --> 00:24:44.800
when worlds collide, when it's
like, I don't know if

490
00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:48.460
I want these friends to
meet my new wife or

491
00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:53.980
fiance or whatever. And that
idea that, you know, Scott Guthrie

492
00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:57.190
is sitting next to like
the wacky guy with the

493
00:24:57.190 --> 00:24:59.830
keg, you know, with the
hat, with two beers on

494
00:24:59.830 --> 00:25:01.180
his head. I don't know
if I want them in

495
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:03.640
my friends list because there's
something that could happen and

496
00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:07.600
they could start talking and
that would be bad. How

497
00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:08.890
do you solve a problem
with that? It's not, I

498
00:25:08.890 --> 00:25:11.020
mean, it's more than a
user interface problem. It's, it's,

499
00:25:11.530 --> 00:25:16.720
it's a it's controls. So,
so having the controls is

500
00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:20.010
not enough because you actually
give users incentive to, to

501
00:25:20.020 --> 00:25:22.420
actually use the control. Yeah.
I mean, how many people

502
00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:25.120
really use privacy on MySpace?
Yeah. Right. So, so you

503
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:26.980
have to give one, you
have to give users incentive

504
00:25:26.980 --> 00:25:29.470
to user controls. Like if,
if I can categorize people,

505
00:25:29.470 --> 00:25:32.410
but nothing happens with the
category, the categories, then I'm

506
00:25:32.410 --> 00:25:34.000
not going to categorize the
people. It's kind of a

507
00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:37.690
chicken and egg problem. Right.
And so the limited profile

508
00:25:37.690 --> 00:25:40.750
that you just talked about,
it's kind of a good

509
00:25:40.750 --> 00:25:44.680
way to get people used
to the idea of categorizing

510
00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:47.350
people. Like, well, say what
you tell them, Hey, if

511
00:25:47.350 --> 00:25:50.320
you categorize some people as
limited versus not limited, you

512
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:52.990
know, then you can have,
here's all my content. And

513
00:25:52.990 --> 00:25:56.740
here's what the people who
are trustworthy or not trustworthy,

514
00:25:56.740 --> 00:25:59.410
but people who I want
to give a more demure

515
00:25:59.410 --> 00:26:03.490
face to get to see.
And then you slowly introduce

516
00:26:03.490 --> 00:26:05.950
that concept of people. And
then they can, they can

517
00:26:05.950 --> 00:26:07.840
think, well, if I, if
I want, I can break

518
00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.920
this down even further, the
user experience, problem that you,

519
00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:14.200
that I believe lots of
people in industry end up

520
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:15.670
having to deal with. And
I haven't seen a good

521
00:26:15.670 --> 00:26:19.690
solution for is that it
ends up being a lot

522
00:26:19.690 --> 00:26:22.690
of stuff to keep track
of. Like, if you actually

523
00:26:22.690 --> 00:26:25.690
did use that feature correctly,
like you would have like

524
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.300
my college buddies, people, I
went to high school with

525
00:26:28.480 --> 00:26:32.230
my coworkers, my neighbors, my
relatives, people I went to

526
00:26:32.230 --> 00:26:36.520
college with. And then you
have to keep no, Right.

527
00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:39.160
I mean, dragging emails into
folders is not fun. And

528
00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:40.630
I'm sure in the heck,
not going to take 1200

529
00:26:40.630 --> 00:26:43.240
people on Facebook and start
dragging them into groups. Exactly.

530
00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.580
Cause what value am I
gonna get out of it?

531
00:26:44.900 --> 00:26:47.030
And then, and then end
of it, even if you

532
00:26:47.030 --> 00:26:49.850
were that obsessive and you
managed to do that and

533
00:26:49.850 --> 00:26:51.770
you also manage to always
do that whenever you got

534
00:26:51.770 --> 00:26:54.230
a, your friend, you still
have to deal with keeping

535
00:26:54.230 --> 00:26:57.560
track of who can see
what, right. So now you,

536
00:26:57.620 --> 00:26:59.960
now you post some photos
up there and you wonder,

537
00:27:00.770 --> 00:27:02.870
did I share this to
my college buddies? And my

538
00:27:02.870 --> 00:27:05.870
coworkers, wait, it's been a
college buddy or a coworker

539
00:27:07.370 --> 00:27:09.830
and so on. Yeah. Yeah.
And that's one of the

540
00:27:09.830 --> 00:27:11.660
things that, about the internet.
That's just who actually, we

541
00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:13.880
should do another podcast about
this sometime. Cause I know

542
00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:16.040
we're running out of time
is the idea that it's

543
00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.730
all coming down to item
and list management. I mean,

544
00:27:19.790 --> 00:27:23.300
my life is become a
job. I'm a filing. I

545
00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.310
have to file everything. Now
I have to file emails.

546
00:27:25.310 --> 00:27:27.620
I have to, I have
to categorize. I feel like

547
00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:31.940
that's all I do anymore
is manage. I mean like

548
00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.030
the, even the psychic weight
of what's happening on my

549
00:27:35.030 --> 00:27:37.310
TiVo, like suddenly the idea
of I can watch a

550
00:27:37.310 --> 00:27:39.920
show. Any time has become,
man, we gotta get those.

551
00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.780
We gotta watch those shows,
man, we gotta watch cold

552
00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.140
case or they're going to
get deleted. Something that was

553
00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:47.120
supposed to be fun and
exciting has now become a

554
00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:51.830
maintenance chore. You know? And
if Twitter started putting in

555
00:27:51.830 --> 00:27:55.370
social context and suddenly tweet
maintenance would become one of

556
00:27:55.370 --> 00:27:59.480
my items, you know, that
I have to do. I

557
00:27:59.480 --> 00:28:02.510
think I can see why
people just kind of back

558
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.860
off and say, I'm opting
out Just yesterday. Someone who

559
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:11.660
was telling me, we have,
we have a newsfeed feature

560
00:28:11.660 --> 00:28:14.300
in windows, live spaces. And
a guy was asking me,

561
00:28:14.690 --> 00:28:16.820
isn't it a bug that
we don't keep track of

562
00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.850
what you've read and what
you haven't read. And I

563
00:28:19.850 --> 00:28:22.520
said, we don't want to
create yet another inbox that

564
00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:24.950
has, you know, you ha
you haven't seen the last

565
00:28:24.950 --> 00:28:27.470
50 messages from your friends
and 20 on red or

566
00:28:27.470 --> 00:28:30.890
30 on red. It's just
like RSS reading. There was

567
00:28:30.950 --> 00:28:33.380
at first, when you start
reading RSS feeds like having

568
00:28:33.400 --> 00:28:35.840
RSS reader actually saves you
time because now I can

569
00:28:35.840 --> 00:28:38.330
go to one app and
track these 10 blogs and

570
00:28:38.330 --> 00:28:40.250
then suddenly you don't hit
it for three or four

571
00:28:40.250 --> 00:28:42.950
days. And then it tells
you, you are 50 or

572
00:28:42.950 --> 00:28:46.640
unread items. And then it
starts going from, wow, this

573
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.160
was saving me time to,
wow, this is becoming a

574
00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:51.620
chore. You know, a, a
really great feature of one

575
00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:54.020
of your, you know, you
work on RSS bandit. I'm

576
00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:55.940
not sure if our suspended
does this, but feed demon.

577
00:28:56.150 --> 00:28:57.770
I just saw this brand
new dialogue a couple of

578
00:28:57.770 --> 00:29:02.270
days ago where it said
you have 24,107 unread items.

579
00:29:02.270 --> 00:29:04.760
And it put a big
fat red button that said,

580
00:29:04.910 --> 00:29:06.680
don't you think it's time
to just push the big

581
00:29:06.680 --> 00:29:09.230
red button and Mark them
all red. It says it's

582
00:29:09.230 --> 00:29:12.170
not email. And they eat.
The dialogue is just instead

583
00:29:12.170 --> 00:29:14.450
of just like, Hey, it's
not email. You don't have

584
00:29:14.450 --> 00:29:16.190
to read them all. And
I was like, rock on.

585
00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:20.360
Thank you for releasing me
from the chore to go

586
00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:24.050
and maintain this crap. Well,
thanks a lot. I really

587
00:29:24.050 --> 00:29:25.910
appreciate you sitting down with
me today. That was good

588
00:29:25.910 --> 00:29:28.250
talking to you. All right.
This has been another episode

589
00:29:28.250 --> 00:29:30.320
of Hansel minutes and we
will see you again next

590
00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:30.530
week.
