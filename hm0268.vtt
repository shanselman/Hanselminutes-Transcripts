00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:44.730
online@wwwdottelerik.com. In this episode, Scott
is interviewed by Ray bingo

7
00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:50.910
about his personal systems of
organization. Hi, this is Scott

8
00:00:50.910 --> 00:00:53.940
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes. And today

9
00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:56.040
we're turning the tables a
little bit. I've got my

10
00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.370
buddy Ray Pango from the
jQuery team and Microsoft on

11
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:01.050
the, on the call here.
And he's going to interview

12
00:01:01.050 --> 00:01:04.140
me because I wanted something
to, to share and I

13
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:06.120
needed a, a, a foil
to help me do it.

14
00:01:06.270 --> 00:01:10.010
How's it going? Right. I'm
glad it's. That's good. So,

15
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:13.070
Scott, you know, there's one
question that that is always

16
00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:15.950
kind of it's, you're, you're
a bit of an enigma

17
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:20.240
in this sense, because you
work remotely obviously, and, but

18
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:22.970
you get so much done.
You're involved a lot of

19
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:24.860
different projects and a lot
of projects are very high,

20
00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:29.150
high profile and indefinitely high,
high importance. And so I

21
00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:30.650
think one of the things
that I'd love to know

22
00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:33.530
about is what are your
personal systems of organization? How

23
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:34.880
do you keep track of
all the things that are

24
00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:36.950
going on in your life?
How do you keep things

25
00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:39.380
organized? How do you manage
all these different projects that

26
00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:43.430
are going on? Cool. That,
that, that is in fact,

27
00:01:43.430 --> 00:01:44.870
the question I wanted you
to ask, how, what a

28
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.750
coincidence, and I'm also interested
in how you do it

29
00:01:47.750 --> 00:01:51.440
as well, because I'm always
talking to people. I'm always

30
00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:54.740
interviewing people and I'm always
even talking to strangers. If

31
00:01:54.740 --> 00:01:57.680
I meet somebody on a
plane, I want to know,

32
00:01:57.980 --> 00:01:59.780
well, gosh, you know, you
seem organized, how are you

33
00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.060
doing that? You know, sometimes
it's a to do dot

34
00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:06.080
text on their desktop, which
is a good system. Sometimes

35
00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.950
I see them in one
note or Evernote. My system

36
00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.500
is always changing. I actually
had the idea for doing

37
00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:14.690
a show like this and
talking about it because I

38
00:02:14.690 --> 00:02:17.420
was looking at a blog
post that I did in

39
00:02:17.420 --> 00:02:20.270
September of 2005. So this
is over six years, almost

40
00:02:20.270 --> 00:02:23.570
six years ago. And this
blog post was called personal

41
00:02:23.570 --> 00:02:28.220
systems of organization. And it
was basically some people at,

42
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.400
at a conference. I was
at noticed that I was

43
00:02:31.850 --> 00:02:35.300
writing some stuff down and
they were teasing me because

44
00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.930
I wasn't using a Palm
pilot, whatever we were using

45
00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:42.050
in 2005, I was writing
stuff down and I call

46
00:02:42.050 --> 00:02:46.130
it sinking to paper. For
me, I'm finding that the

47
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:49.370
more chaotic my life gets,
the more unorganized my life

48
00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:51.740
gets. I always seem to
turn to a piece of

49
00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:55.190
paper for that kind of
kinesthetic feel that, that, that,

50
00:02:55.790 --> 00:02:59.650
that sense of actually pushing
ink around and reminding myself

51
00:02:59.650 --> 00:03:02.260
of what's important. So while
I have a number of

52
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:06.280
digital formats, I use one
note. I recently switched from

53
00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.430
Evernote and I'll talk about
that more and more. When

54
00:03:09.430 --> 00:03:12.310
it comes down to getting
my day done, I use

55
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.110
a piece of paper and
I'll carry it around. And

56
00:03:14.590 --> 00:03:17.650
I use a, what's called
a molar Skeena it's spelled

57
00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:21.130
moleskin, M O L E
S K I N E.

58
00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:24.310
But it's pronounced Moschino. I
believe I've got a little

59
00:03:24.310 --> 00:03:26.280
one in a pink one,
a little one goes in

60
00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:28.570
my back pocket with a
space pen. You know, Joe,

61
00:03:28.570 --> 00:03:29.890
at the funeral, you give
a space pen, you know,

62
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:34.420
with her face, man. Oh
my friend. So the space

63
00:03:34.420 --> 00:03:39.640
pen. So the joke is
that that America, that NASA

64
00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:43.120
went in general, you know,
created this amazing pressurized pen.

65
00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.330
It's called the Fisher space
pen. And it's, it's about

66
00:03:46.330 --> 00:03:49.030
the size of your, your
middle finger. And when you

67
00:03:49.030 --> 00:03:51.160
open it up, it actually
doubles in size and it

68
00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:52.870
becomes a normal pen size.
And it's filled with a

69
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:56.740
pressurized container, like a co
two gas that makes the

70
00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.250
contents under pressure, such that
you can write on underwater.

71
00:04:00.250 --> 00:04:03.550
You can write upside down,
you can write on oil.

72
00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:06.400
It's just, it's an amazing,
perfect pen. And it was

73
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.920
like $40 million worth of, you
know, thing in order for

74
00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.340
us to write in space,
it's called the space pen

75
00:04:12.790 --> 00:04:14.830
and what are the Russians?
Do they use a pencil?

76
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:19.560
Okay. That makes a lot
of sense. They broke it

77
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:22.050
down and just went back
to him. Yeah. So that's

78
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:23.550
the classic, but I love
my space. Ben, it's the

79
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:25.860
best little Bestival pen. And
it's great about it is

80
00:04:25.860 --> 00:04:27.290
that it's tiny. Like I
say, it's about the size,

81
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:29.930
your middle finger. So the
space pen and the Moschino

82
00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.430
are in my pocket. And
that's the, I just had

83
00:04:32.430 --> 00:04:34.470
an idea because I think
I don't know about you

84
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.570
and I'm interested in your
opinion as well. The most

85
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:39.570
important aspect of keeping organized
is being able to take

86
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:42.840
whatever you're doing at the
time and things that come

87
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:47.040
up and if something comes
up, capture it. Because I

88
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:50.380
think that there's the getting
things done aspect of, of,

89
00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:53.610
of personal systems organization, but
then there's the capturing stuff

90
00:04:53.610 --> 00:04:57.150
as it happens. Like what
if my wife called me

91
00:04:57.150 --> 00:05:00.570
right now get milk? Where,
where are you going to

92
00:05:00.570 --> 00:05:02.220
put that right now? Your
wife calls in the middle

93
00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:04.680
of our show and says,
get milk. What do you

94
00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:07.800
do? Right. So what I
do is I, I open

95
00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:11.200
up my windows phone seven,
of course, and I, I

96
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:13.770
use a, an application called
notes Lee, and it's great

97
00:05:13.770 --> 00:05:15.750
for that because I can
just whip it out and

98
00:05:15.750 --> 00:05:18.600
say, I'm going to type
in my, to do disc

99
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.880
list. And I just cross
them off as I go.

100
00:05:21.390 --> 00:05:24.300
And it's funny, you mentioned
that my wife who uses

101
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:27.330
a Blackberry at the moment
has become totally addicted to

102
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.870
Blackberry's task manager for managing
her life. A lot of

103
00:05:30.870 --> 00:05:35.400
the things that you're mentioning
to me really, really resonate

104
00:05:35.400 --> 00:05:38.940
with the way that she
handles her. You know, some

105
00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.680
of the things that she
has in her life as

106
00:05:40.680 --> 00:05:43.500
well, she's, she's very busy
with her job. So if

107
00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:46.650
she doesn't keep things very
organized and very task driven,

108
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:50.460
it's, it's tougher to keep
track of obviously her job,

109
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:54.450
obviously the family life and
especially the baby. For me,

110
00:05:54.570 --> 00:05:57.440
I definitely like to have
pen and paper, like to

111
00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.050
have like a pad sitting
on my desk that says,

112
00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:01.910
these are the tasks that
I need to accomplish today.

113
00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:04.160
And I scratched them off.
And some people might think

114
00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:06.410
that I'm a little bit
old school, Matt, but I

115
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:09.440
just find that having that
pen and paper makes things

116
00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:13.460
substantially easier for me. And
I compliment that with Outlook's

117
00:06:13.470 --> 00:06:18.380
task management capabilities, but for,
I just find pen and

118
00:06:18.380 --> 00:06:23.200
paper to be a better
organizational method for me. Right,

119
00:06:23.290 --> 00:06:25.570
right. Exactly. There's something, there's
something about it. Now of

120
00:06:25.570 --> 00:06:28.030
course, the number one thing
in any personal system of

121
00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:29.950
organization is you have to
trust it and you have

122
00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:32.650
to be happy with it.
So don't necessarily take someone

123
00:06:32.650 --> 00:06:34.540
else's like, if, if I've
got a good system and

124
00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.100
you're listening to the show
or Ray's got a good

125
00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:39.370
system, don't take it and
enforce it. If it doesn't

126
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:43.480
feel right, then pick another
system. And GTD was, was

127
00:06:43.480 --> 00:06:45.220
that for me as well,
by the way, I actually

128
00:06:45.220 --> 00:06:47.860
read the GTD book and,
and tried to implement it.

129
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:49.840
It just didn't work for
me. It didn't feel natural.

130
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.570
And so I I've had
to kind of build a

131
00:06:52.570 --> 00:06:56.080
hybrid of different systems that
make it, make it effective

132
00:06:56.080 --> 00:06:59.410
for me. Right. GTD of
course being David Allen's getting

133
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:03.280
things done book. So the
first thing first step of

134
00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.590
a personal system of organization
is being able to capture

135
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:08.920
things that happen. So always
have something on your person,

136
00:07:08.920 --> 00:07:10.510
whether it be a phone
or whether it be a

137
00:07:10.510 --> 00:07:13.570
piece of paper or whatever,
always have a pen, always

138
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:15.670
have a paper, always have
a phone, something that do,

139
00:07:15.940 --> 00:07:17.950
if you have an idea
that whole kind of, Oh,

140
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:19.300
I just woke up and
I had a dream and

141
00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:20.830
I want to write it
down or I was in

142
00:07:20.830 --> 00:07:24.160
the shower and I solved
this coding problem. So, so

143
00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:28.240
important. Now, from that point,
I break things up into

144
00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:30.820
short term, like extremely short
term, like, what am I

145
00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:33.880
going to do in the
next few days, short term,

146
00:07:33.880 --> 00:07:35.860
like a week to a
month from now and then

147
00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.020
longterm, like, what am I
doing for, for the next

148
00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:41.380
year for me, I like
to have this. I'd like

149
00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:44.410
to visualize myself moving through
time, moving through the course

150
00:07:44.410 --> 00:07:47.530
of a year. I don't
know how that's one of

151
00:07:47.530 --> 00:07:50.950
hard to explain, but I've
always had a very conscious

152
00:07:50.950 --> 00:07:54.370
sense of where I am
within the calendar year. Does

153
00:07:54.370 --> 00:07:55.690
that make sense? Like, I
think about it as like

154
00:07:55.690 --> 00:07:58.120
a giant progress bar. Like
I know that we're in

155
00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.490
may right now and entering
June. So I have this

156
00:08:00.490 --> 00:08:03.790
sense of us in the
center slightly to the left

157
00:08:04.090 --> 00:08:07.360
of this, this progression that
is the year, you know

158
00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:12.220
what I mean? And so
then I want to know

159
00:08:12.220 --> 00:08:14.410
like, well, where am I
going to be when, when

160
00:08:14.410 --> 00:08:16.150
I'm kind of about here
and kind of about there

161
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:19.480
and kind of about there,
you know, everyone, everyone needs

162
00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:23.140
to have a conscious awareness
about how their mind naturally

163
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.240
thinks and wants to think.
And then you make your

164
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:29.920
system work for that. Like,
for example, using that, that,

165
00:08:29.930 --> 00:08:32.470
that sense of movement through
time, that really helps me.

166
00:08:33.430 --> 00:08:36.910
I don't like digital watches
because they only tell me

167
00:08:37.450 --> 00:08:39.670
where I'm at right now.
And there's no way to

168
00:08:39.670 --> 00:08:43.870
look at a digital watch
and know like what three

169
00:08:43.870 --> 00:08:47.650
o'clock would feel like, or
that sense of distance between

170
00:08:47.650 --> 00:08:49.750
one 30 and three o'clock.
You know what I mean?

171
00:08:50.390 --> 00:08:52.330
Right. And that's, that's pretty
far out there. It's got,

172
00:08:52.330 --> 00:08:54.370
I never gave it that
much thought, but that's, that's

173
00:08:54.430 --> 00:08:57.180
actually pretty, it Was a
little kind of a, you

174
00:08:57.180 --> 00:09:00.210
know, everyone was like, okay,
now it's, God's going to

175
00:09:00.210 --> 00:09:03.180
do yoga on a podcast,
but, but, but in all

176
00:09:03.180 --> 00:09:06.930
seriousness, there's, there's two interesting
things there. I think first

177
00:09:06.930 --> 00:09:10.290
is a conscious awareness of
how, how I think about

178
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:12.870
time and how time moves.
And I like to look

179
00:09:12.870 --> 00:09:15.090
at the clock, the analog
clock and say, okay, it's

180
00:09:15.090 --> 00:09:17.700
like, you know, right now
it's about nine 30. And

181
00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:20.310
I have a sense of
the, of this amount of

182
00:09:20.310 --> 00:09:23.460
space, the amount of time
between now and noon. And

183
00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:26.790
then I chop that time
up and I like to

184
00:09:26.790 --> 00:09:29.190
use the Pomodoro system. If
you're familiar with the Pomodoro

185
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:32.760
system, I've never heard of
the Pomodoro system. So Pomodoro,

186
00:09:32.790 --> 00:09:36.120
if I understand correctly is
like Italian for tomato and

187
00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:39.120
a Pomodoro system. If you
go up and search for

188
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:43.230
it, you can get the
free book. There's this tomato

189
00:09:43.230 --> 00:09:45.630
timer. It's like an egg
timer. It's just shaped like

190
00:09:45.630 --> 00:09:48.570
a tomato and they use
it in Italy and around

191
00:09:48.570 --> 00:09:53.700
Europe. And you set it
for 25 minutes. So think

192
00:09:53.700 --> 00:09:57.180
of a Pomodoro as a
unit of time, like a,

193
00:09:57.810 --> 00:09:59.750
you know, just like a
minute or a second over

194
00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:04.920
Pomodoro. So Pomodoro is 25
minutes and then think about

195
00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.740
your tasks and how many
Pomodoros it will take to

196
00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:10.620
do your task. So for
example, you know, when we

197
00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:11.940
get off the Mister, let
me look at my list

198
00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:14.400
here. When we get off
the call here, I have

199
00:10:14.400 --> 00:10:17.340
to go and do some
work and, and Bronco on

200
00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:20.220
the asp.net website. Right? And
it's probably gonna take me

201
00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.580
about an hour. So I'm
going to say that's two

202
00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.500
Pomodoros. What's significant amount of
Pomodoro is that they are

203
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:30.420
Automic, meaning that the goal
of a Pomodoro and the

204
00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:33.480
goal of focusing for 25
minutes is just that it

205
00:10:33.480 --> 00:10:38.130
is to focus. Can you
sit down, mute this and

206
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:40.290
shut down outlook and do
everything to shut everything off

207
00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:45.300
and only do one thing
sprint for 25 minutes without

208
00:10:45.300 --> 00:10:48.990
interrupting yourself. That's the, that's
the idea of the system.

209
00:10:49.050 --> 00:10:50.460
And then when you're done,
you say, all right, well,

210
00:10:50.460 --> 00:10:53.430
I've just achieved one Pomodoros
worth of work. And what's

211
00:10:53.430 --> 00:10:55.170
significant about that is it's
25 minutes. Then you have

212
00:10:55.170 --> 00:10:56.820
five minutes for a break.
It's a half an hour

213
00:10:56.820 --> 00:10:59.250
now, and then you do
another one. And the funny

214
00:10:59.250 --> 00:11:03.060
thing is, and everyone should
try this challenge yourself to

215
00:11:03.060 --> 00:11:06.870
do one task for 25
minutes without any internal or

216
00:11:06.870 --> 00:11:09.900
external interruptions. And the goal
of the system is to

217
00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.280
identify what are the internal
interruptions. That means where you

218
00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:18.630
literally interrupted yourself and what
are the external interruptions? So

219
00:11:18.660 --> 00:11:21.120
external interruptions are like, knock
on the door or phone

220
00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:24.870
call some toast that pops
up on your screen. I

221
00:11:24.870 --> 00:11:28.230
call that toast, you know,
the messenger toast and Skype

222
00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:32.640
toast and Twitter toast and
out outlook toast. Those can

223
00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.180
be external interruptions. Those can
be maintained and managed. And

224
00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:39.330
that the Pomodoro system tries
to teach you awareness of

225
00:11:39.330 --> 00:11:42.360
time and how you move
through it. So if you

226
00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:44.430
sit down for 25 minutes
to work on the asp.net

227
00:11:44.430 --> 00:11:46.430
website, Let's take a step
back because you made a

228
00:11:46.430 --> 00:11:48.380
great point. I mean, how
do you, I think a

229
00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.840
lot of people would love
to know how, how what's

230
00:11:50.840 --> 00:11:54.400
the best way to manage
these type of distractions, these

231
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:57.370
things, these pieces of toast
pop up. Is it just

232
00:11:57.370 --> 00:11:59.080
a civil matter of saying,
Hey, let's turn off. I

233
00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.230
am during these 25 minute
sprints that we're doing, or

234
00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:05.110
is there a better way
of handling it so that

235
00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:08.140
let's say coworkers, aren't put
off. If you don't respond

236
00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:10.680
to them in a certain
amount of time. Okay. That's

237
00:12:10.680 --> 00:12:12.650
a good question. That's a
good question. So there's, there's

238
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:16.110
two things and it is
philosophy before it is in

239
00:12:16.110 --> 00:12:21.330
practice. First, do this for
several days and write down

240
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.840
that an, that an interruption
occurred because you can't change

241
00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:27.960
something unless you measure it
right. You can't change yourself

242
00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:30.660
unless you're aware of a
problem. So what you do

243
00:12:30.660 --> 00:12:32.700
is you just, there's actually
a form. You can print

244
00:12:32.700 --> 00:12:34.140
out and do this. You
just put it next to

245
00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:35.970
your desk. And every time
an interruption happens, you just

246
00:12:35.970 --> 00:12:38.790
put a little tick Mark.
And you say, I tried

247
00:12:38.790 --> 00:12:41.280
to work on the asp.net
website for one Pomodoro, and

248
00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:45.810
I was interrupted externally seven
times. And then you do

249
00:12:45.810 --> 00:12:47.250
this for a couple of
days. And you look at

250
00:12:47.250 --> 00:12:48.630
that and you kind of
do it a little analysis

251
00:12:48.630 --> 00:12:51.840
and you say, wow, I'm
getting interrupted on average 10

252
00:12:51.840 --> 00:12:56.970
times every half an hour.
And remember that interruptions in

253
00:12:56.970 --> 00:13:00.120
a computer system slow down
processing. I mean, you were

254
00:13:00.120 --> 00:13:02.430
doing an interruption. It's like,
stop. Listen to me. I'm

255
00:13:02.430 --> 00:13:07.470
IO. I'm, I'm more important
than actual work first, recognize

256
00:13:07.470 --> 00:13:09.060
them. And then think about
what you're going to do

257
00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:12.540
about them. So toast interruptions
are easy, you know, do

258
00:13:12.540 --> 00:13:15.300
not disturb, shut down outlook,
shut down, Twitter, shut down,

259
00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.360
whatever. What's great about an
idea like a Pomodoro is

260
00:13:18.390 --> 00:13:22.200
it's only 25 minutes. You
know, you surely can go

261
00:13:22.770 --> 00:13:26.190
25 minutes without like checking
your email, right? And if

262
00:13:26.190 --> 00:13:28.170
you can't, then you definitely
have a problem or you're

263
00:13:28.350 --> 00:13:33.240
a brain surgeon or something.
So I actually schedule meetings

264
00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.110
with myself and then I
shut everything off. I mute

265
00:13:37.110 --> 00:13:41.130
everything. And I do my
sprint That I actually, I

266
00:13:41.130 --> 00:13:44.910
liked that a lot. I
haven't thought about that. That

267
00:13:44.910 --> 00:13:47.970
technique is scheduling meetings and
blocking off a space so

268
00:13:47.970 --> 00:13:51.930
that people understand that this
is, this is time that's

269
00:13:51.930 --> 00:13:55.500
being consumed at the moment.
Please don't interrupt. That's actually

270
00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:58.320
a very good idea. So
those are, those are external

271
00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:01.710
interruptions. Those are recognizing that
and setting up external interruptions

272
00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:06.150
just as if you were
managing a project, Pomodoro technique

273
00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.960
is almost like a mini
scrum, right? Where your scrums

274
00:14:09.960 --> 00:14:12.690
are 25 minutes long instead
of two weeks. And there's

275
00:14:12.690 --> 00:14:15.930
only one person. So it's
like, imagine yourself, you're sitting

276
00:14:15.930 --> 00:14:17.850
down at your desk. You're
like, all right, here we

277
00:14:17.850 --> 00:14:20.070
go. Let's do it. You
turn the timer on, you

278
00:14:20.070 --> 00:14:22.860
have the awareness of time.
And they actually prefer timers

279
00:14:22.860 --> 00:14:25.290
that like tick, and you
can even find applications. I

280
00:14:25.290 --> 00:14:26.940
bet you, if you look
in the windows phone, seven

281
00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:29.400
works a, you know, a
marketplace. And I know there's

282
00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:31.380
lots of an iPhone. I
bet you that you could

283
00:14:31.380 --> 00:14:34.530
find a Pomodoro timer that
is focused on this system

284
00:14:34.530 --> 00:14:38.640
of organization. And oftentimes there's
an, there's a ability to

285
00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:42.930
make those things click so
that you get you're aware

286
00:14:42.930 --> 00:14:47.460
of the passage of time.
So those are external interruptions.

287
00:14:47.970 --> 00:14:50.100
Next are internal interruptions. And
I like to think of

288
00:14:50.100 --> 00:14:53.780
interruptions as my, my left
thumb and my left middle

289
00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:56.450
finger, because those are the
fingers that push all tab

290
00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:59.150
without me thinking about it.
You know what I mean?

291
00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:01.730
Like an internal interruption is
I'm in word and I'm

292
00:15:01.730 --> 00:15:04.700
really rocking. And then suddenly
my middle finger and my

293
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:06.770
thumb all tab me over
to Twitter. And I'm like,

294
00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:09.950
what was that? Who, what,
what beast took over my

295
00:15:09.950 --> 00:15:11.780
hand and decided that we
needed to look at Twitter

296
00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:15.620
right now. That's an internal
interruption and internal interruption could

297
00:15:15.620 --> 00:15:18.110
be that it could be,
you're really focused. You're writing

298
00:15:18.110 --> 00:15:20.720
your book and then suddenly
your brain is like, what's

299
00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:29.900
on TV tonight. And it's
a hard problem. Hi, this

300
00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:32.210
is Scott coming to you
from another place in time.

pulse. And please do thank
Tellerik for supporting Hansel minutes

318
00:16:28.430 --> 00:16:33.290
on their Facebook fan page,
facebook.com/t L E R I

319
00:16:33.290 --> 00:16:36.770
K Tellerik. We do appreciate
it. There wouldn't be a

320
00:16:36.770 --> 00:16:40.600
Hansel minutes. If there wasn't
teller helping us. Some of

321
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:42.940
it, I feel like it's
almost muscle memory and you

322
00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:46.150
all have is such great.
A great analogy to that

323
00:16:46.150 --> 00:16:48.370
is, and I find myself
doing that as well. And

324
00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.860
it's the all tab thing.
Hey, there's let me, I

325
00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:53.740
haven't checked Twitter in last
15 minutes. Let me check

326
00:16:53.740 --> 00:16:55.990
to see what's going on.
So I definitely get that

327
00:16:56.350 --> 00:16:59.500
the internal ones are definitely
more difficult to control. So

328
00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:02.740
how would you manage that?
So the, the, with all

329
00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:07.540
things recognize it and then
take action. So to, to

330
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.090
notice that you're doing that
is step one, right? Knowing

331
00:17:10.090 --> 00:17:13.060
is half the battle is
GI. Joe always said, once

332
00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.030
you write this stuff down,
literally read the Pomodoro technique

333
00:17:16.030 --> 00:17:18.790
book, write down that. Well,
you know, sure. I'm getting

334
00:17:18.790 --> 00:17:23.320
interrupted externally 10 times every
half an hour, but you

335
00:17:23.320 --> 00:17:27.730
might find you're, you're literally
interrupting yourself every minute. And

336
00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.120
people have found this even
interrupting themselves as often as

337
00:17:31.480 --> 00:17:34.720
a couple of times a
minute. I mean, think about

338
00:17:34.720 --> 00:17:37.480
what kind of CPU could
really achieve any work at

339
00:17:37.480 --> 00:17:41.200
all. If it's getting interrupted
so often and you have

340
00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:45.130
to ask yourself, I've just
interrupted myself. I want to

341
00:17:45.130 --> 00:17:47.830
go over to Twitter, but
is that moving the ball

342
00:17:47.830 --> 00:17:51.270
forward? Because I find that
the Pomodoro system helps me

343
00:17:51.270 --> 00:17:53.910
deal with that sense of
guilt that I think we

344
00:17:53.910 --> 00:17:57.120
all feel. I mean, maybe
it's just me and maybe

345
00:17:57.120 --> 00:17:59.370
it's just you and me,
but don't you ever have

346
00:17:59.370 --> 00:18:01.590
that sense where you sit
down and it's nine o'clock

347
00:18:01.620 --> 00:18:03.510
and you're ready to attack
the day. And you know,

348
00:18:03.510 --> 00:18:06.750
you've got three things to
get done today and then

349
00:18:06.780 --> 00:18:08.670
boom, it's 1130. Well, you
might as well go to

350
00:18:08.670 --> 00:18:11.010
lunch. You really haven't done
anything. Then you come back.

351
00:18:11.010 --> 00:18:14.880
It's too. Okay. Now you're
okay. With three 45, four,

352
00:18:14.910 --> 00:18:17.910
well, four o'clock. Okay. I'll
work late. It'll get done.

353
00:18:18.150 --> 00:18:19.560
And then I'll put the
kids down and then I'll

354
00:18:19.560 --> 00:18:21.000
work until two in the
morning and then I get

355
00:18:21.030 --> 00:18:22.980
stuff done. And then you
have that sense of guilt.

356
00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:26.550
That sense that I really
got nothing done. And I

357
00:18:26.550 --> 00:18:29.420
have absolutely no one to
blame, but myself today. I

358
00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.910
think a lot of people
relate to that. Yeah. Tell

359
00:18:31.910 --> 00:18:34.010
me, tell me, I'm not,
please, please re tell me

360
00:18:34.010 --> 00:18:35.960
I'm not the only person
that feels Oh, of course

361
00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:38.060
not Scott. I mean, it's,
I I've been through that,

362
00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:40.460
so you're, you're definitely not
alone. And I can, I

363
00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.790
would bank that 90% of
the people that will listen

364
00:18:43.790 --> 00:18:45.620
to this will say, God,
I've been in that position.

365
00:18:46.220 --> 00:18:48.890
Yeah. Well, I want to
bring that kind of out

366
00:18:48.890 --> 00:18:53.120
in the open because that
kind of I've, I've accomplished

367
00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:57.440
nothing. You've let yourself down.
And then what happens is,

368
00:18:57.440 --> 00:19:00.440
and this is where we
get into dangerous situations. You

369
00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:02.810
start to get angry, you
start to get frustrated, you

370
00:19:02.810 --> 00:19:04.370
start to think I'm not
good enough. And you get

371
00:19:04.370 --> 00:19:06.950
into self-loathing and all that
kind of stuff, because you

372
00:19:07.040 --> 00:19:11.750
burned a day, right? First,
everyone burns a day where

373
00:19:11.750 --> 00:19:13.070
you want to, where you
want to deal with it

374
00:19:13.070 --> 00:19:14.960
as if you're burning every
day. You know what I

375
00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:21.290
mean? And I find that
setting a sense of what's

376
00:19:21.290 --> 00:19:22.910
a reasonable amount of work
I can get done. You

377
00:19:22.910 --> 00:19:24.920
know how, when we do,
when we do scrums, if

378
00:19:24.920 --> 00:19:28.010
you've ever done scrum or
agile, no one really, no

379
00:19:28.010 --> 00:19:31.700
one says that a programmer
has eight really productive hours

380
00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.730
in a day. Right? The
assumption when we do scrum

381
00:19:36.350 --> 00:19:39.110
planning is that you have
between five and six productive

382
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:42.040
hours in a day, you
know, you gotta be gotta

383
00:19:42.050 --> 00:19:44.390
factor in the bathroom and
go into McDonald's or whatever,

384
00:19:44.390 --> 00:19:46.730
right? But you've got five
to six hours of productive

385
00:19:46.730 --> 00:19:50.510
time. So why not say
I'm going to accomplish 12

386
00:19:50.540 --> 00:19:53.600
Pomodoros worth of work. That's
12, 25 minute things with

387
00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:57.920
breaks in my day. And,
and even if you have

388
00:19:57.920 --> 00:20:02.390
to schedule email as one
of those things and then

389
00:20:02.510 --> 00:20:06.080
make little sprints and you
would be surprised at how

390
00:20:07.130 --> 00:20:10.880
much more productive that you,
that you feel. That's actually

391
00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:12.740
a really good idea. I
haven't tried that. I'm actually

392
00:20:12.740 --> 00:20:15.200
going to give that, that
shot. I'd like to learn

393
00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:17.000
a little more about the
system, because it sounds like

394
00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.600
it's, it's easier to manage
it. Well, they've always said

395
00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:24.830
it's easier to manage smaller
compartments of anything, and it

396
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:27.830
is trying to tackle a
massive project all in one

397
00:20:27.830 --> 00:20:32.690
shot. So compartmentalizing your, I
guess your, your daily schedule

398
00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:35.120
makes a whole lot of
sense to me, Right? So

399
00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:37.970
there's, there's, there's literally four
different systems that I use.

400
00:20:38.450 --> 00:20:42.500
And I realized that everyone
has a system and like

401
00:20:42.530 --> 00:20:46.490
everyone's selling something, right? But
there's so there's, there's Stephen

402
00:20:46.490 --> 00:20:49.900
Covey and the seven habits
of highly effective people. He

403
00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:54.880
talks about quadrants. Basically his
system is all about categorizing.

404
00:20:54.880 --> 00:20:59.170
What's important. What's urgent. What
is both important and urgent?

405
00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:03.310
What is neither urgent, nor
important, like trivial work like

406
00:21:03.310 --> 00:21:07.840
Twitter, what is urgent, but
not really that important and

407
00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.780
what is important, but not
urgent. And he tells you,

408
00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:13.180
he separates them in quadrants
and says, you should, you

409
00:21:13.180 --> 00:21:16.030
should work on things that
are important, but not urgent.

410
00:21:16.030 --> 00:21:19.600
Like project work, those things
move, move. The world forward.

411
00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:23.590
That's called the quadrant of
leadership. So Covey helps me

412
00:21:23.590 --> 00:21:29.680
categorize time. Getting things done,
basically says, have a trusted

413
00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:33.010
system take everything in your
life from, I need to

414
00:21:33.010 --> 00:21:35.020
get a guy to paint
the house, which is something

415
00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:39.430
I need to do to,
I have to do something

416
00:21:39.430 --> 00:21:42.910
at work and put everything
in a trusted system. A

417
00:21:42.910 --> 00:21:45.820
trusted system could be one
note or Evernote or outlook

418
00:21:45.820 --> 00:21:48.250
or Omni giraffe or whatever
tool you like could be

419
00:21:48.250 --> 00:21:51.370
a piece of paper, but
you have to literally empty

420
00:21:51.370 --> 00:21:57.970
your brain of all things
that could potentially cause you

421
00:21:57.970 --> 00:22:02.020
psychic weight. Like literally, well,
how can I work on

422
00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.780
this book or this blog
post. If I'm thinking that

423
00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:06.820
I really got call this
guy about the paint in

424
00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.640
the house, if I put
it into a trusted system,

425
00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:12.220
then I can release it
to the world. I don't

426
00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:17.770
have to think about it.
So Covey for categorization, David Allen

427
00:22:17.770 --> 00:22:19.870
and getting things done and
helps me think about things

428
00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:26.200
like releasing things to the
world, then Pomodoro for actual

429
00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:30.790
sprints. And then the, the
fourth system actually is a

430
00:22:30.790 --> 00:22:34.000
buddy of mine named J
D Meyer who actually works

431
00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:37.900
at, at Microsoft. And he
has a thing on his

432
00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:43.540
website called called agile results.
And basically he takes the

433
00:22:43.540 --> 00:22:48.130
agile system of organization and
applies it to yourself. I

434
00:22:48.130 --> 00:22:51.610
think his website is getting
results.com. It's a free book

435
00:22:51.610 --> 00:22:54.490
that you can download. It's
really cool. And what he

436
00:22:54.490 --> 00:22:58.240
says is that you should
split up the things that

437
00:22:58.240 --> 00:23:02.500
you need to do into
three things. That's basically like

438
00:23:02.530 --> 00:23:04.240
every day. Remember when, when
I, when I was your

439
00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:08.170
manager, we did this. Do
you remember this? Remember the

440
00:23:08.170 --> 00:23:09.970
three things we would send
out in the beginning of

441
00:23:09.970 --> 00:23:13.600
the week and the end
of the week. So the

442
00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.320
idea is you, you write
down three things you want

443
00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:20.410
to accomplish at the beginning
of the day, you write

444
00:23:20.410 --> 00:23:22.870
down, you say, okay, if
this day, if nothing else

445
00:23:22.870 --> 00:23:25.390
happens today, these are the
three things I need to

446
00:23:25.390 --> 00:23:28.780
do. And then you do
them at the granularity of,

447
00:23:28.960 --> 00:23:30.790
you know, here are three
things I could actually accomplish

448
00:23:30.790 --> 00:23:34.360
today. Then you have three
things that would be nice

449
00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.250
if I got done and
then three things, it probably

450
00:23:36.250 --> 00:23:39.580
won't get done. And then
you do that on a,

451
00:23:40.120 --> 00:23:42.850
on a daily basis, on
a weekly basis and on

452
00:23:42.850 --> 00:23:45.620
a monthly basis and go
from there. And I've, I

453
00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:47.420
keep those in one note,
I have a list of

454
00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.370
the things that I really
want to get done today

455
00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:53.060
and what, what would make
me feel successful if I

456
00:23:53.060 --> 00:23:55.070
got those things done? And
that's the most important thing,

457
00:23:55.550 --> 00:23:59.480
because the opposite of that
feeling of guilt and self

458
00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:03.680
destruction and getting nothing done
is, well, tell me, it

459
00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:05.510
was obviously pretty good day.
I know I got those

460
00:24:05.510 --> 00:24:07.070
things done, those three things
I said I was going

461
00:24:07.070 --> 00:24:12.500
to do. And he recommends
that you have a planning

462
00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:15.470
session of, for yourself basically
in the, in the morning

463
00:24:15.470 --> 00:24:19.190
on Monday. And then on
Friday, you reflect on on

464
00:24:19.190 --> 00:24:21.080
the week. And this is
something I don't think people

465
00:24:21.080 --> 00:24:23.930
do. They don't look back
on their week and say,

466
00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.230
did I take it? That
stuff done? You know what

467
00:24:27.230 --> 00:24:28.520
I mean? They just kind
of like, they have their

468
00:24:28.520 --> 00:24:31.550
Friday and they just leave
and both getting things done

469
00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:34.850
and getting results. Ha think
that there's is importance of

470
00:24:34.850 --> 00:24:38.290
reflection of on Fridays. Well,
one of the good things

471
00:24:38.290 --> 00:24:40.840
is that when, when you,
you asked the team to

472
00:24:40.840 --> 00:24:43.330
start doing those, those three
bullet points that every Monday

473
00:24:43.330 --> 00:24:46.540
was that you also reminded
us to kind of look

474
00:24:46.540 --> 00:24:49.690
back at what you had
talked about accomplishing during that

475
00:24:49.690 --> 00:24:53.380
week and, and also analyzing
what you accomplished, what was

476
00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:56.890
the, the, the net effect
of that, and also why

477
00:24:57.160 --> 00:24:59.680
you weren't able to accomplish
something. And, and, you know,

478
00:24:59.770 --> 00:25:01.390
it didn't mean that you
were going to get in

479
00:25:01.390 --> 00:25:04.120
trouble for not accomplishing something.
It just meant what was

480
00:25:04.120 --> 00:25:06.580
the reason that you weren't
able to. And sometimes there

481
00:25:06.580 --> 00:25:08.410
were actually very good reasons
that sometimes it was just,

482
00:25:09.250 --> 00:25:11.170
you just didn't get around
to it. So it was,

483
00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:14.560
it was a really good
exercise and I actually carry

484
00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:17.410
that forward now. Yeah. I'm
glad, I'm glad that it's

485
00:25:17.410 --> 00:25:19.570
still six around. We've actually
started using it a little

486
00:25:19.570 --> 00:25:21.160
bit on the, on the,
on the new group that

487
00:25:21.160 --> 00:25:25.690
I'm on and web platform.
And again, that's all that

488
00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.780
getting results.com it's all free.
Or if you want, you

489
00:25:28.780 --> 00:25:31.320
can buy the book and
get the dead tree. He

490
00:25:31.330 --> 00:25:34.060
calls it the rule of
three, three, three outcomes for

491
00:25:34.060 --> 00:25:37.000
the day three outcomes for
the week. And you have

492
00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.910
a vision for your week,
calls it Monday, vision, Friday

493
00:25:39.910 --> 00:25:42.760
reflection. So you say, here's
the things I'm going to

494
00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:45.430
get done. And then on
Friday you reflect on it

495
00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:47.080
and you say, well, here's
three things that I think

496
00:25:47.080 --> 00:25:50.110
are going well. And here's
how I think I'm going

497
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:52.540
to improve. So what I
tried to do as a,

498
00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:57.400
as a manager was collect
the three things that all

499
00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:59.500
of you guys, I think
there were five or six

500
00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:02.850
guys plus myself here that
we all have three things

501
00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.630
we want to get done.
What can I, as a

502
00:26:04.630 --> 00:26:08.110
manager do to get something
out of your way, right?

503
00:26:08.110 --> 00:26:11.380
My job is to make,
make you successful. So I

504
00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:13.600
look at your vision for
the week and I think

505
00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.040
about what can I do?
And then at the, at

506
00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:16.840
the end of the week,
I would have everyone send

507
00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:19.810
out just three bullets. And
this is really important to

508
00:26:19.810 --> 00:26:22.840
point out. I wasn't asking
for like a weekly report

509
00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.460
of like pros and photographs,
and here's all the stuff

510
00:26:27.460 --> 00:26:29.290
that we did this week.
I just want to know

511
00:26:29.290 --> 00:26:31.150
what's going well and what's
not. And how can I

512
00:26:31.150 --> 00:26:34.900
help fix whatever's wrong? Yup.
And now that was actually

513
00:26:34.930 --> 00:26:39.400
a great thing. It, it
really just helped put, put

514
00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:42.730
your, your workweek in perspective.
And again, I never felt

515
00:26:42.730 --> 00:26:44.940
pressured. This is an end
of week report. I felt

516
00:26:44.940 --> 00:26:46.530
like this is a tool
that's going to allow me

517
00:26:46.530 --> 00:26:48.810
to better organize what I
was gonna accomplish in the

518
00:26:48.810 --> 00:26:51.930
week. And with so many
things moving there, there's just

519
00:26:51.930 --> 00:26:54.300
so many moving targets at
Microsoft. You need to have

520
00:26:54.300 --> 00:26:56.340
that system in place. You
need to understand what are

521
00:26:56.340 --> 00:26:58.170
your goals and how are
you going to reach those

522
00:26:58.170 --> 00:27:00.930
specific goals. So I think
jotting down these specific tasks

523
00:27:00.930 --> 00:27:04.500
and especially tasks that were
very strategic to your specific

524
00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:09.080
role within Microsoft. Yeah. One
of the other things that

525
00:27:09.080 --> 00:27:10.880
JD talks about, and I
think I should probably get

526
00:27:10.880 --> 00:27:12.860
him on the show too,
to say better than I

527
00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:16.130
can, but he has boundaries.
People are always asking about,

528
00:27:16.130 --> 00:27:19.100
well, how do you have
like work life balance. He

529
00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.710
calls him hotspots and he
says, you should set boundaries.

530
00:27:21.740 --> 00:27:25.130
So for example, like your
body, are you working out

531
00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:28.490
a minimum of like, say
three hours a week, you

532
00:27:28.490 --> 00:27:33.140
should set mins and maxes.
Like he suggests, for example,

533
00:27:33.290 --> 00:27:35.660
three at maximum minimum of
three hours a week spent

534
00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:38.660
on your body working out
or, or stretching or whatever,

535
00:27:39.290 --> 00:27:42.530
maximum of 50 hours on
career. He's like makes a

536
00:27:42.530 --> 00:27:44.510
conscious thing. Like I will
not work more than 50

537
00:27:44.510 --> 00:27:46.100
hours a week. Doesn't matter
what it is because I

538
00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.950
know that anything over that
will cause me pain and

539
00:27:48.950 --> 00:27:52.520
trouble and that stuff, a
minimum of eight hours on

540
00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:56.530
relationships know that could be
a date night or, or

541
00:27:56.630 --> 00:27:59.960
two date nights a week
or whatever, you know, and

542
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:02.060
by setting those mins and
maxes, you're kind of like

543
00:28:02.510 --> 00:28:06.020
adjusting these progress bars on
your, on your life. And

544
00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:08.720
you want to find that,
that, that sweet spot where

545
00:28:09.230 --> 00:28:12.050
if these boundaries are maintained
and I'm, and I'm not

546
00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:15.620
over taxing myself on career
or on relationships or on

547
00:28:15.620 --> 00:28:19.010
whatever, then, then you get
to feel good about everything.

548
00:28:19.820 --> 00:28:22.400
And the whole goal of
all these kinds of systems

549
00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:26.270
kind of synthesized together is
just to not feel lousy

550
00:28:26.270 --> 00:28:28.700
about yourself. Cause I that's
my biggest problem. I always

551
00:28:29.510 --> 00:28:32.330
feel like a failure if
I, you know, work 55

552
00:28:32.330 --> 00:28:35.570
hours that week or whatever,
and it didn't work out

553
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:39.170
at all last week. And
if I can put together

554
00:28:39.170 --> 00:28:42.590
a system that will assist
me in not feeling lousy

555
00:28:42.590 --> 00:28:46.580
about myself, then that's a
good system of organization. How

556
00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.710
does the fact that you
travel quite a bit affect

557
00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:54.440
your, your ability to stay
very organized? Well, when I

558
00:28:54.440 --> 00:28:56.810
travel, like for example, I
was in Atlanta last week

559
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.200
and first I made sure
that everything at the house

560
00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:02.930
and everything that the wife
and kids needed was done.

561
00:29:02.930 --> 00:29:06.590
So that might mean, you
know, I'm leaving leaky faucets,

562
00:29:06.590 --> 00:29:10.280
alarm system, you know, cameras,
all the different things around

563
00:29:10.280 --> 00:29:14.060
the house. Batteries are charged,
iPads, work, kids have the,

564
00:29:14.070 --> 00:29:16.700
what they need for school.
Is there any, you know,

565
00:29:16.730 --> 00:29:19.430
basically, is there anything that
I can do upfront before

566
00:29:19.430 --> 00:29:22.730
I go, that's going to
make their lives easier? I

567
00:29:22.730 --> 00:29:25.850
do that first. And then
for me, I always, as

568
00:29:25.850 --> 00:29:29.710
I'm going out the door,
I, I print out a,

569
00:29:29.710 --> 00:29:32.420
a piece of paper that
actually shows where I'm supposed

570
00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:35.930
to be. That's really important
to me to kind of

571
00:29:35.990 --> 00:29:39.020
be aware where am I
supposed to be and remove

572
00:29:39.050 --> 00:29:45.220
any potential areas of difficulty,
whether it be, you know,

573
00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.280
finding, finding buses or trams
or getting off the plane,

574
00:29:48.280 --> 00:29:49.900
making sure that, you know,
all that stuff. I, I

575
00:29:49.900 --> 00:29:52.240
just, I can't be stressing
about that kind of stuff.

576
00:29:52.240 --> 00:29:55.270
When I'm, when I'm traveling,
I travel to get the

577
00:29:55.270 --> 00:29:59.080
job done and then come
back. I don't, I don't

578
00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:01.920
like to dilly dally. You
know what I mean? Right.

579
00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:03.510
For me when I travel,
one of the things that

580
00:30:03.510 --> 00:30:06.060
I, I just, I feel
most comfortable with is having

581
00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:08.580
a certain level of redundancy
in the things that I

582
00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:12.000
need to accomplish. So I
do print out a lot

583
00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.220
of stuff. I'll, I'll print
out my whole itinerary. I'll

584
00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:17.460
print out a whole conference
schedule. I'll highlight the specific

585
00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.040
key things that I want
to attend. But in addition

586
00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:23.160
to that, I make sure
that on my phone, I

587
00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.980
have everything that I wanna
accomplish because I need to

588
00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:27.780
have that handy. I don't,
I don't want to be

589
00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:29.520
reaching for a piece of
paper constantly. I want to

590
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.830
be able to immediately have
access to what I need

591
00:30:31.830 --> 00:30:33.930
to do. And, and of
course, filling in my calendar

592
00:30:33.930 --> 00:30:37.080
with key parts, things that
I need to attend is

593
00:30:37.320 --> 00:30:40.140
to me, it's invaluable without
it. I just could not

594
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.900
function the way I needed
to. When I'm traveling, you're

595
00:30:42.900 --> 00:30:46.080
away from home, you don't
have all your tools and

596
00:30:46.110 --> 00:30:48.790
you need to leverage every
bit of functionality you have.

597
00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:50.130
So that's, that's one of
the things that I do.

598
00:30:50.130 --> 00:30:53.010
I, I will fill my
phone up with a ton

599
00:30:53.010 --> 00:30:55.380
of information and I, and
the other part is I

600
00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.810
don't necessarily depend on the
cloud. I think a lot

601
00:30:57.810 --> 00:31:00.960
of people have become very,
very used to putting everything

602
00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.840
into the cloud. But if
your cell phone doesn't work,

603
00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:07.470
for some reason, you may
not have cell phone reception.

604
00:31:08.070 --> 00:31:09.450
You're kind of out of
luck at that point. So

605
00:31:09.450 --> 00:31:11.910
that's why I like to
have the redundancy of having

606
00:31:11.910 --> 00:31:14.520
something stored locally. And I
have, I'd like to have

607
00:31:14.550 --> 00:31:17.070
print copy of it. I'd
like to have very, very

608
00:31:17.070 --> 00:31:19.590
set schedules. So it just
gives me that reassurance, that

609
00:31:19.590 --> 00:31:20.790
things are going to go
the way I need it.

610
00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:23.790
Yeah. It's funny. He actually,
one of the silly little,

611
00:31:23.790 --> 00:31:26.730
a silly little, a silly
little tip that I came

612
00:31:26.730 --> 00:31:28.950
up with on my own
last week was a, you

613
00:31:28.950 --> 00:31:32.280
know, those, the airport, they
let you check in now

614
00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.090
with an electronic barcode. So
they give you a link

615
00:31:36.090 --> 00:31:37.560
in your email, you click
on it and then they

616
00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:39.420
send you to a QR
code. And then suddenly you

617
00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.570
can, you know, hold your
phone over the scanner and,

618
00:31:42.870 --> 00:31:45.090
you know, check in. But
that only works if you

619
00:31:45.090 --> 00:31:48.990
have a good connection. So
I started taking screenshots with

620
00:31:48.990 --> 00:31:53.100
the phone. So when I
go up to the, up

621
00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:55.260
to the gate to check
in, I'm not actually visiting

622
00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:57.720
the website and fumbling around.
I've actually showing them a

623
00:31:57.720 --> 00:32:01.710
photograph of the browser when
I did have connectivity. That's

624
00:32:01.710 --> 00:32:05.850
great. I forgot. That's a
great idea. I love it.

625
00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:09.900
Yeah. And then actually, a
Scott, Scott, Kate, a friend

626
00:32:09.900 --> 00:32:13.200
of mine carries a camera
around and takes pictures of

627
00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:17.220
everything, takes pictures of his
receipts, where he parked his

628
00:32:17.220 --> 00:32:20.640
car, what floor he's on
and the, you know, w

629
00:32:20.670 --> 00:32:23.340
and the hotel. I mean,
anything that he could potentially

630
00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:26.700
get wrong or forget, he
takes a picture of which

631
00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.550
I think is a really
good idea. Every receipt, anything

632
00:32:29.550 --> 00:32:32.340
he could lose. He takes
a picture of, I've been

633
00:32:32.340 --> 00:32:35.240
doing that lately with my
phone, Everything moves so fast.

634
00:32:35.250 --> 00:32:37.980
God. And if you don't
take the time to do

635
00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:40.790
these things, there's just no
way for you to manage

636
00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:43.790
all the different aspects of
your life. It's just not

637
00:32:43.790 --> 00:32:46.580
there. So I think that
the ideas that you've talked

638
00:32:46.580 --> 00:32:49.070
about are, you know, they're
just fantastic. I'm definitely gonna

639
00:32:49.070 --> 00:32:51.320
start looking at how I
can apply some of those

640
00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:54.770
things to my work, my
work life, as well as

641
00:32:54.770 --> 00:32:57.400
trying to balance out my,
my family lives too. I'm

642
00:32:57.400 --> 00:32:59.950
glad it's a, it's, it's
a little unorganized and it's

643
00:32:59.950 --> 00:33:03.040
always being changed. But I
think the real takeaway is

644
00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.160
if we can help somebody
is have some kind of

645
00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:09.250
plan, you know, it doesn't
have to be getting results.com.

646
00:33:09.250 --> 00:33:12.820
It doesn't have to be
David Allen or Stephen Covey or

647
00:33:12.850 --> 00:33:18.940
the Pomodoro system, but hope
is not a strategy, you

648
00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.470
know, working heroically and working
harder. And trying to, if

649
00:33:23.470 --> 00:33:25.660
I work, just work another
20 hours a week, then

650
00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:27.370
I can catch up and
then everything will be okay.

651
00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.550
That is not a strategy.
So as long as you

652
00:33:30.550 --> 00:33:33.850
pick one and make it
work for you, and if

653
00:33:33.850 --> 00:33:35.770
it doesn't work, pick something
else, then I think that

654
00:33:36.040 --> 00:33:39.100
will be all right. But
thanks for, for helping me

655
00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.570
out with the show today.
Right. I really appreciate it.

656
00:33:41.470 --> 00:33:45.250
Thanks for having me. Alright.
This has been another episode

657
00:33:45.250 --> 00:33:47.380
of Hanselminutes and we'll see
you again next week.
