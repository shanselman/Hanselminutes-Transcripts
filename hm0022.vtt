00:01:09.440 --> 00:01:15.980
of interest for the second
installment of Hansel minutia. Hi,

13
00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.400
this is Carl Franklin. You're listening
to Hansel minutes. I'm here

14
00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:21.950
with Scott Hanselman, of course,
in the post tech head

15
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:24.890
show. Hi Scott. Hey, how
are you? This is Hansel

16
00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:27.590
minutia. Number two. So you
had a good time at

17
00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:29.750
tech ed. Did you? Yeah,
I mean, Tucker, I thought

18
00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:32.540
this year was better than
a long time. I was

19
00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:34.610
a little jaded, I think
last year's tech ed and

20
00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:36.590
the tech Before that. What
was so great about it

21
00:01:36.590 --> 00:01:39.860
this year? Oh man, the
vibe was good. The people

22
00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:44.030
were fun. Yeah, seriously. They
actually, there were so many

23
00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:45.830
people sitting on the floor
in front of the TVs,

24
00:01:45.830 --> 00:01:47.600
watching the world cup, they
set up, they set up

25
00:01:47.660 --> 00:01:50.810
chairs all this way to
come all this way just

26
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.060
to watch the world cup.
But the feeling was good.

27
00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.760
And there was this, these
TLCs, these technical learning centers

28
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:57.350
where they basically set up
a bunch of chairs and

29
00:01:57.350 --> 00:02:00.350
couches. It was like they
took an entire conference and

30
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.600
turned it into a big
living room of nerds. Yeah.

31
00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:05.270
I liked that. It was
really cool. They used to

32
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.970
call them cabanas, but they
were called TLCs this time

33
00:02:07.970 --> 00:02:10.040
and I really thought it
worked great. And man, I

34
00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:13.310
met some awesome people. It
was really fun. It was

35
00:02:13.310 --> 00:02:15.380
very, it's very cool. Just
to be able to sit

36
00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:17.660
down on the couch with
like the architecture team and

37
00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:21.440
chat. Totally. It's like a
cotillion with, with, with geeks.

38
00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.180
Yeah. Yeah. Everyone had their
best, their best t-shirts with

39
00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.660
funny sayings and tacky shorts
on it was, it was

40
00:02:28.700 --> 00:02:30.410
very good. The only thing
that was the only thing

41
00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:32.000
that sucked about this year's
tech ed, there was no

42
00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:35.960
decent swag. Nobody was giving
away any USP. Actually. They

43
00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:38.990
were really what did you,
you missed it. It was

44
00:02:38.990 --> 00:02:43.700
over near the RD. Booth.
Microsoft was a Microsoft press

45
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.040
had a booth there. And
if you filled out a

46
00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.720
questionnaire, you know, a survey,
you got the most righteous

47
00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:53.780
USB kit. It was not
just a key. It was

48
00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.350
a kit. It had a
wireless mouse, it had a

49
00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.310
card reader. It had a
Bluetooth. It was awesome. Oh,

50
00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:03.400
you're killing me. Yeah. It
probably lasted an hour. And

51
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.290
it had like six or
seven different things in it.

52
00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:07.570
That's pretty cool. It's amazing.
Yeah. I got no good

53
00:03:07.570 --> 00:03:10.090
swag. It was pretty sad.
Oh, well that was really

54
00:03:10.090 --> 00:03:12.660
the only good one. Okay.
What'd you do after? Oh,

55
00:03:12.660 --> 00:03:14.610
well actually I was very
fortunate enough to take a

56
00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:17.100
little time off work first
vacation in a while. And

57
00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:21.330
the wife and I went
down to Las Vegas, New Mexico,

58
00:03:21.510 --> 00:03:24.600
not Las Vegas, Nevada, but
Las Vegas, New Mexico. Wow. Where

59
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.810
my wife went to school
and because it's far away

60
00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:31.620
from any airports we flew
into Albuquerque and then rented

61
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:34.520
a car and I had
to do the $5 a

62
00:03:34.530 --> 00:03:38.070
day GPS option. So what's
that? We ran a car

63
00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:40.560
GPS and then yeah, I
rented a car, picked up

64
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:44.820
the GPS and this, I
usually do the Hertz. I

65
00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.010
do the hurts, never lost,
but what I ended up

66
00:03:47.010 --> 00:03:51.300
with was a what's called
a Garmin NUVI Hmm. This

67
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:56.100
is@ashrinkstir.com slash G 75. We
had to drive from Albuquerque

68
00:03:56.190 --> 00:03:58.680
through Santa Fe to Las
Vegas and then out to

69
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.970
a place called Montezuma, New Mexico.
And man, this thing is

70
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:06.630
freaking awesome. You've you used
it in an, in car

71
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:09.180
GPS before my Prius has
one. Okay. So you've got

72
00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.280
the builtin Prius one, right?
So I've got the older

73
00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.740
Prius, the 2001, and I've
been trying to figure out

74
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:15.960
how I'd like hack into
this thing and get the

75
00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:19.230
screen set up. But apparently
for the 2001, you can't

76
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:22.530
get a GPS. They've got
the button for it, but

77
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.900
you can't get it installed.
So I'm trying to figure

78
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.910
how to do this. And
you know, I tried the

79
00:04:26.910 --> 00:04:30.210
whole carry the laptop thing
around, right. I got Matt

80
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:35.730
point 2006 strange there slash
<inaudible>. And then I got

81
00:04:35.730 --> 00:04:39.240
the, the builtin at the
built in, but it's a

82
00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.790
little cheapo GPS. I wrote
an article about this for

83
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:44.370
coding for fun once. And
there's an article up on

84
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:47.250
Microsoft shrink stir slash G
seven D that tells you

85
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:49.680
how to, how to basically
navigate. And the guy in

86
00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:53.820
the article actually mounted his
tablet PC to his dash.

87
00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.960
Cool. I think that's pro
well cool. Awesome. Yes. Possibly

88
00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:00.480
illegal in a number of
States. Yeah. Yeah. I have,

89
00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:04.200
I tried something like that
a while ago before I

90
00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:06.810
got the Prius and it
didn't work out all that.

91
00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.350
Well. I mean, he really,
especially with the stylist, it's

92
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:15.270
not very safe or practical
to use a stylist on

93
00:05:15.270 --> 00:05:18.570
a computer while driving, especially
safe. I definitely found it

94
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.380
to be very uncomfortable. Didn't
feel safe. And then I

95
00:05:22.380 --> 00:05:24.990
had the wife sit in
the window with the laptop

96
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:27.570
in her lap. Yeah. She
was definitely not feeling it.

97
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:29.580
And I was really looking
forward to the new map

98
00:05:29.610 --> 00:05:32.790
point 2006. They had said
it included turn by turn

99
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.140
directions, but it doesn't actually
read the street name. So

100
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:38.790
you're just kind of going
along and then you hear

101
00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:41.770
kind of a built in
windows thing, go turn, turn,

102
00:05:41.790 --> 00:05:44.460
ride. And it's like, Oh
dude. So there wasn't that

103
00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:47.430
real sense that it was
there with you. Right. And

104
00:05:47.940 --> 00:05:49.770
so you get the laptop
and then the big long

105
00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.960
cord. And then you've got
the suction cup with the

106
00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.570
GPS up on the wall.
Yep. Wasn't really feeling it

107
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.060
now in this car that
I, with this Garmin NUVI

108
00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:01.160
new, I think it was
the three 10, but then

109
00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:03.590
I went around and looked
into this and saw that

110
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:06.020
the three 60 is the
one to get the garment

111
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:10.190
three 60 shrink stir slash
G seven seven. And this

112
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:15.260
guy will not only read
the, read the street names

113
00:06:15.260 --> 00:06:18.260
to you, but it also
supports Bluetooth. So you can

114
00:06:18.260 --> 00:06:21.950
actually use it as a
phone. Wow, cool. It'll it

115
00:06:21.950 --> 00:06:24.440
has an iPod attachment. So
it'll be an actual controller

116
00:06:24.440 --> 00:06:27.680
for your iPod. No kidding.
It's got an SD slot

117
00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.750
and you can, you know,
talk to it with your

118
00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:33.100
computer. You can download things
to it. So it'll say

119
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.670
turn left on high street
now. Exactly. Yeah. That's it'll

120
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:39.160
say. Yeah. Oh. And actually,
while I was driving, there

121
00:06:39.160 --> 00:06:41.050
were like three or four
times. It did some pretty

122
00:06:41.050 --> 00:06:44.440
amazing stuff where it said
things like, you know, veer

123
00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:48.850
right onto ramp stay in
right lane, you know, those

124
00:06:48.850 --> 00:06:50.230
kinds of things where you
get onto a ramp and

125
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:52.210
it's like, where am I
going? Right. You know, stay

126
00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:56.560
on right lane to <inaudible>
South. And it was funny.

127
00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:58.300
There's a lot of different
voices. You can select, the

128
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:01.960
lady had an Australian accent.
So I don't know how

129
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:04.840
they do that. But they
had an, a text to

130
00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:08.680
speech with an Australian accent.
Yeah. Very, very cool. What

131
00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:11.440
I started thinking about reminded
me of a rant that

132
00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:15.850
I had a couple of
years back where this little

133
00:07:15.850 --> 00:07:18.820
device, this new movie and
the devices like it, that

134
00:07:18.820 --> 00:07:22.090
we'll talk about like the
Tom, Tom are basically big

135
00:07:22.090 --> 00:07:26.320
giant four inch screens with
some storage and they're they're

136
00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:29.110
touchscreens, right? Yeah. It's a
big, it's a portable screen.

137
00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:33.400
Right? Why is it that
I have so many devices

138
00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:37.630
in my pocket that are
screens, batteries and input devices.

139
00:07:38.140 --> 00:07:39.820
Right. I know what you're
getting at. You want them

140
00:07:39.820 --> 00:07:42.940
all to be one, right?
Right. And the pocket PC,

141
00:07:42.940 --> 00:07:45.670
I don't think is that.
And I mean, I, right

142
00:07:45.670 --> 00:07:48.940
now I've got an insulin
pump with batteries, a screen

143
00:07:49.060 --> 00:07:53.740
wireless buttons, a Blackberry, you
know, a cell phone, a

144
00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:59.140
pager laptop, yada yada, yada,
an iPod Bluetooth allows these

145
00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.960
devices to talk to each
other. But why am I

146
00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:04.660
paying for, I feel like
I'm paying hundreds of dollars

147
00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.800
for LCDs. Yeah. Over and
over again. Right. The garment

148
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:11.800
has got this gorgeous four
inch backlit screen. I really

149
00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.690
feel like I should only
have to buy one gorgeous

150
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.720
four inch backlit screen. So
I had a, I had

151
00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.210
an idea at one time
to make a battery belt

152
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:23.140
because batteries are always, you
know, going dead and you

153
00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:25.150
never have enough batteries and
you know how they can

154
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:27.460
make these batteries slim. Well,
it'd be kind of cool

155
00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:30.520
to sort of wrap, wrap
one around a belt and

156
00:08:30.520 --> 00:08:32.870
wear a belt, you know?
Yeah. You know, if, if,

157
00:08:32.870 --> 00:08:35.350
if you, if the action
of you walking could charge

158
00:08:35.350 --> 00:08:39.160
that, now that would be
cool. Then there's devices like

159
00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:41.500
this. So there's a buddy
of mine has a, a

160
00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:44.290
friend of a friend who
has a company that makes

161
00:08:44.290 --> 00:08:47.920
backpacks with solar panels. Huh.
You know, so there's, there's

162
00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:50.230
all this wasted power out
there that could be used.

163
00:08:50.230 --> 00:08:51.910
But the thing that I
was most concerned about is

164
00:08:51.910 --> 00:08:54.220
the, you know, here's a
device that's awesome that I

165
00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:59.890
want to buy. That's $800
and that's ridiculous. A couple

166
00:08:59.890 --> 00:09:02.820
of hundred is gotta be
the screen. And then, you

167
00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.360
know, the storage, which is
an SD card or a

168
00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:10.290
small hard drive, I felt
for awhile that maybe the

169
00:09:10.290 --> 00:09:13.770
pocket PC would be that
device with a screen that

170
00:09:13.770 --> 00:09:16.440
I could use, but Bluetooth
allows them to communicate to

171
00:09:16.440 --> 00:09:18.450
each other. But what I
really need is a device

172
00:09:18.660 --> 00:09:22.140
without a screen that will
let you use any other

173
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:24.900
device as a screen. So
write a protocol that was

174
00:09:24.900 --> 00:09:28.840
like remote desktop, you needed
A portable dumb terminal, basically.

175
00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:33.110
Exactly. So interestingly, this is
a GPS and sure it

176
00:09:33.110 --> 00:09:34.730
does all that great stuff.
And it's from a GPS

177
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.040
company, but this is about
the closest thing I've ever

178
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.100
seen to a portable, dumb
terminal. You plug in your

179
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.790
iPod, it shows you iPod
stuff. You put your photos

180
00:09:43.790 --> 00:09:46.790
and your JPEGs on it.
And it turns into a

181
00:09:46.790 --> 00:09:49.790
slide show. You talk to
you, plug it into your

182
00:09:49.790 --> 00:09:52.580
phone via Bluetooth. It is
your phone. So this thing

183
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:58.490
becomes the, the, the upscale
expensive car dashboard that your

184
00:09:58.490 --> 00:10:00.980
cheap car doesn't have. That's
great. Now of course you

185
00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:03.200
have a shiny car. You've
got a Prius, so you've

186
00:10:03.200 --> 00:10:05.660
got this. But I started
looking around on the net

187
00:10:05.660 --> 00:10:08.240
about this thing. And people
can not shut up about

188
00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:11.210
this Garmin NUVI wow. At
37 signals, which is it's

189
00:10:11.210 --> 00:10:16.580
shrink, stir slash <inaudible>. There
is a glowing review. The

190
00:10:16.580 --> 00:10:19.610
guy says that other than
the iPod, no other device

191
00:10:19.610 --> 00:10:23.180
has changed his life like
this device. And then another

192
00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:25.490
guy compared it with a
thing called the Tom, Tom,

193
00:10:25.730 --> 00:10:28.730
this was at shrinks or
slash <inaudible> for a while

194
00:10:28.730 --> 00:10:31.700
there, it was looking like
this, Tom, Tom, which is

195
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.880
huge in Europe, was going
to be the iPod of,

196
00:10:34.970 --> 00:10:39.260
of GPSs. But the Tom
Tom is huge. The new

197
00:10:39.260 --> 00:10:41.780
Tom, Tom nine, 10 has
got all the same features,

198
00:10:41.780 --> 00:10:46.790
the Bluetooth, the text to
speech. But the, the it's

199
00:10:46.790 --> 00:10:49.370
huge. It's like an old
style. Remember the size of

200
00:10:49.370 --> 00:10:53.420
a, one of those Macintoshes,
the IMAX, where there were

201
00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:55.490
a giant monitor, right? So
you look at it, it

202
00:10:55.490 --> 00:10:57.020
looks flat and you look
at the look at the

203
00:10:57.020 --> 00:10:59.630
side and it looks like
an old Zenith colored TV

204
00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:04.550
Is, are either of these
things useful outside of the

205
00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.200
car, or do they have
to be in the car

206
00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.690
Exactly. That you're getting, you're
getting exactly where I'm headed.

207
00:11:08.990 --> 00:11:12.350
So the Tom Tom has
that weird shape that kind

208
00:11:12.350 --> 00:11:15.860
of quasi CRT TV shape
that the old iMac had.

209
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:18.320
She had this great foreign
screen, but then it becomes

210
00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:20.600
this kind of lump that
you can carry around with

211
00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.830
you. Right. The NUVI same
kind of size as far

212
00:11:24.830 --> 00:11:26.750
as the face is concerned,
but it's the size of

213
00:11:26.750 --> 00:11:29.810
a deck of cards. Nice.
So it's like a, it's

214
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:33.830
like a full screen iPod
video, and then you can

215
00:11:33.830 --> 00:11:36.890
start imagining yourself, picking it
up off your, you know,

216
00:11:37.100 --> 00:11:39.800
undocking it basically out of
your car and walking around

217
00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:43.100
town. Yeah. Find me the
local Quiznos, you know, things

218
00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:44.930
that are crucial in your
life, like where the local

219
00:11:44.930 --> 00:11:48.260
Queens noses. And Can it
be powered by batteries? Obviously

220
00:11:48.260 --> 00:11:50.510
it can, if you can
take it around, Can, I've

221
00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:52.820
heard four to six hours.
I've heard eight hours in

222
00:11:52.820 --> 00:11:54.790
the battery. So basically you
charge it with your car

223
00:11:54.790 --> 00:11:59.560
charger and this, the, the
garment, the garment UI man,

224
00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:02.920
it's, there's no buttons. It's
all touchscreen. Nice. And I

225
00:12:02.920 --> 00:12:06.460
really, really liked it. It,
you know, it doesn't have

226
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:09.160
the whole shiny Google earth
kind of thing. It's very

227
00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:13.210
bright 3d graphics. Right. But
it really does. It does

228
00:12:13.210 --> 00:12:16.000
the job. I found some
prices on it. They say

229
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.970
it is about 900 bucks,
which is like about 500

230
00:12:18.970 --> 00:12:22.090
bucks more than it should
be, but on frugal at

231
00:12:22.090 --> 00:12:25.480
shrink stir slash <inaudible>, I
found it for as low

232
00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.540
as 700. So now I'm
thinking to myself for 700

233
00:12:28.540 --> 00:12:32.260
bucks, I could get two
really nice pocket PCs. Right.

234
00:12:32.290 --> 00:12:33.970
Couldn't you, I mean, what's
a pocket PC cost these

235
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.930
days. Yeah. That's about what
they cost. Yeah. So what

236
00:12:37.930 --> 00:12:40.240
is it about this thing
that is other, you know,

237
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:42.700
other than a bright screen,
that's keeping me from doing,

238
00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:45.730
using a pocket PC I
looked around and I'm just

239
00:12:45.730 --> 00:12:48.760
not seeing a lot of
great software for the pocket

240
00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:52.720
PC that does the same
kind of stuff. This portion

241
00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.550
of Hanselman it's is brought

to www.covidsmithtools.com. And now let's

249
00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:37.170
get back to Hansel minutes.
The problem with a pocket

250
00:13:37.170 --> 00:13:40.920
PC is that there's limited
Ram, very, very limited Ram

251
00:13:41.520 --> 00:13:44.130
and limited storage. So, I
mean, yeah, you have SD

252
00:13:44.130 --> 00:13:45.780
cards and you could get,
I guess, a two gig

253
00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:48.840
SD card, but it's two
gigs, right? So I mean,

254
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:52.410
GPS data takes a lot.
And the stuff that I've

255
00:13:52.410 --> 00:13:55.200
seen, you basically have to
choose a very small region

256
00:13:55.710 --> 00:13:57.960
in which you're going to
travel. And, you know, if

257
00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.840
you just happened to be
traveling outside of that region,

258
00:14:00.870 --> 00:14:03.450
Oh no. Now I gotta
go deal with this map

259
00:14:03.450 --> 00:14:06.240
data, you know, and replace
the stuff that's in there.

260
00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:07.980
Right? So one of the
things that these guys are

261
00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.800
definitely doing to make it
a little easier is a

262
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.740
massive amounts of onboard storage.
You know, early GPS has

263
00:14:13.740 --> 00:14:18.750
had you downloading maps, like
before you go somewhere, he,

264
00:14:18.750 --> 00:14:20.400
you don't go ahead and
load up ahead of time.

265
00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:25.200
Right? All of these devices
have like 750 megs of

266
00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:29.190
built in storage, you know,
big amounts of storage. The,

267
00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:31.680
the Tom Tom has got
like all of your, all

268
00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:34.260
of Western Europe installed or
all of the U S

269
00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:37.770
installed the new V I
believe has all of the

270
00:14:37.770 --> 00:14:41.100
U S and Europe installed
as well as the ability

271
00:14:41.100 --> 00:14:44.040
to download more stuff. Now,
the Tom, Tom just came

272
00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.350
up with a new one
called the go nine, 10,

273
00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:49.860
that's got a 16 by
nine screen. That looks pretty

274
00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:52.880
hardcore, but it's still, it's
still got this big fat,

275
00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:57.980
this thickness to it, right?
That's about 800 bucks. It's

276
00:14:57.980 --> 00:15:00.590
got all of Canada, all
of Western Europe, and it

277
00:15:00.590 --> 00:15:04.760
includes a 20 gig hard
disk. Wow. While the, the

278
00:15:04.760 --> 00:15:07.520
other one uses the 750
megs of storage and then

279
00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:10.910
includes additional space for, for
MP3s and stuff like that.

280
00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:13.880
There's a couple of other
ones like the teletype it's

281
00:15:13.880 --> 00:15:17.930
shrink, stir slash <inaudible> and
the Dolores. I'm not sure

282
00:15:17.930 --> 00:15:21.200
how to tell the army
shrinks their slash G seven

283
00:15:21.590 --> 00:15:24.650
F these appear to be
kind of third and fourth,

284
00:15:24.680 --> 00:15:26.600
but a distant third and
fourth. I know that they,

285
00:15:26.630 --> 00:15:30.440
the Delores may particularly has
got their folks that really

286
00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:33.160
think this is the one
to get. We tried Delores

287
00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:36.550
may on the, on the
road trip, the dotnet rocks

288
00:15:36.550 --> 00:15:39.760
road trip last year. Yeah.
And it just, wasn't doing

289
00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.290
a good job. It wasn't.
And we tried an older

290
00:15:44.290 --> 00:15:47.920
version of streets and trips,
and I think we ended

291
00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:50.380
up using Delorme just because
it worked the best with

292
00:15:50.380 --> 00:15:53.680
the GPS, like it locked
on. But in, in terms

293
00:15:53.680 --> 00:15:57.520
of accuracy, it sorta really
broke down, especially when we

294
00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.790
would get into the cities.
Didn't understand cities very well.

295
00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:03.280
Maybe that was because of
the new construction. I don't

296
00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:05.080
know, but we weren't all
that happy with it. Huh.

297
00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:07.510
And this was after the
GPS has included their new,

298
00:16:08.020 --> 00:16:10.780
they turned off the obfuscation
that the government used to

299
00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:13.120
add to throw you off
by 20, 30 meters, right?

300
00:16:13.510 --> 00:16:16.060
Yes. Yeah. So this was
pretty recent. This was last

301
00:16:16.060 --> 00:16:18.520
October. Yeah. So I was
driving around, you know, in,

302
00:16:18.520 --> 00:16:21.430
in New Mexico. So I didn't
have any trouble getting, getting

303
00:16:21.430 --> 00:16:24.220
satellites at all, even in
the cities with four and

304
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:27.100
five story buildings. But I
haven't, I have not driven

305
00:16:27.100 --> 00:16:29.290
through New York with a GPS.
I'm not sure how they,

306
00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:31.540
how they do that. They
might, might have something to

307
00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:34.030
amplify that, that stuff just
like they have cell phone

308
00:16:34.030 --> 00:16:36.460
amplifiers inside of tunnels. Have
you ever been Using a

309
00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:38.680
GPS and you put in
a, you know, you put

310
00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:41.410
in a destination and it
says, this is the best

311
00:16:41.410 --> 00:16:44.890
route. And then you find
yourself going through all these

312
00:16:44.890 --> 00:16:46.600
back roads and saying, Hey,
I didn't have to go

313
00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.170
this way. And yeah, that's
been happening to me quite

314
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:53.020
a bit on the Prius
these days. It does give

315
00:16:53.020 --> 00:16:55.270
you a choice of routes,
but don't you think that

316
00:16:55.270 --> 00:16:58.240
the first route, the default
route that comes up where

317
00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:01.870
you just press OK, should
be the best route? Well,

318
00:17:01.870 --> 00:17:05.080
interestingly on both of these
devices and particularly the Tom,

319
00:17:05.080 --> 00:17:07.540
Tom is known for this,
they actually ask you, are

320
00:17:07.540 --> 00:17:10.780
you looking for the fastest
or the shortest? Yeah. You

321
00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:13.780
know, cause there's those people
who would rather drive fast

322
00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:15.520
on a toll road and
pay the buck and get

323
00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.160
there faster versus the guy
who really will do anything

324
00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.230
at all to avoid that.
And what we'll just take

325
00:17:20.230 --> 00:17:23.080
the chances with life, It's
wind through the Hills and

326
00:17:23.080 --> 00:17:25.870
the woods. A number of
times with the Garmin, I

327
00:17:25.870 --> 00:17:27.970
thought was really odd when
I was driving it actually

328
00:17:27.970 --> 00:17:30.340
in the middle of it
seemed to change its mind

329
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:32.710
who would be driving. And
it would announce there's a

330
00:17:32.710 --> 00:17:35.530
better route. I'm not really
clear where it got that,

331
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:38.830
but I understand that the
garment has this subscription format

332
00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:43.930
that will actually tell you
via FM receivers, where construction

333
00:17:43.930 --> 00:17:46.390
is currently happening. Wow. This
is one of the things

334
00:17:46.390 --> 00:17:49.350
that I did like about
the map point 2006, I

335
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.080
needed an internet connection to
get ahold of it actually

336
00:17:52.080 --> 00:17:55.560
was able to download a
construction information and an on

337
00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:59.160
my map marked in yellow,
that part of the road

338
00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:02.490
that was under construction and
the garment has this ability

339
00:18:02.490 --> 00:18:04.200
to, and I think the
Tom, Tom as well, the

340
00:18:04.200 --> 00:18:06.420
two routes you around that.
So one of the things

341
00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:08.250
that I think is cool.
Yeah. One of the things

342
00:18:08.250 --> 00:18:10.920
that calls these guys out,
versus some of the, just

343
00:18:11.250 --> 00:18:15.330
buying some $300 GPS is
this real time updating of

344
00:18:15.330 --> 00:18:19.170
this information, which starts getting
me in thinking into a,

345
00:18:19.470 --> 00:18:21.760
what I really want is
a Google earth, right? We

346
00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:26.220
want a real persistent internet
connection. I want basically I

347
00:18:26.220 --> 00:18:28.530
want the thing to see
that my Bluetooth phone is

348
00:18:28.530 --> 00:18:32.670
there and download that information
over the internet connection. But

349
00:18:32.730 --> 00:18:35.220
they can't because when you're
out there in your car,

350
00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.680
you're out there in your
car, you've got the radio

351
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.230
and XM radio, right? That's
all you, that's the only

352
00:18:40.230 --> 00:18:42.780
place you can be pulling
data from maybe the pager

353
00:18:42.780 --> 00:18:46.170
network. So these guys still
use this FM back channel

354
00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.750
because there's so much information
out there that I potentially

355
00:18:48.750 --> 00:18:51.600
might want to get a,
like a mashup. Right. We've

356
00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:54.090
seen so many mashups that
we've talked about before, like

357
00:18:54.090 --> 00:18:57.150
on our show on geocashing.
Why can't I mash up

358
00:18:57.150 --> 00:19:01.020
my information and see, you
know, other useful stuff, like

359
00:19:01.050 --> 00:19:05.010
check this out, take a
look at shrink, stir.com/g seven

360
00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:09.330
G. This is crazy. So
one of my favorite websites

361
00:19:09.330 --> 00:19:14.190
is called overheard in New York.
Okay. This is overheard in

362
00:19:14.190 --> 00:19:17.190
new york.com. It may be
a little offensive to some

363
00:19:17.190 --> 00:19:19.470
users because what it is
is it's people in New York,

364
00:19:20.010 --> 00:19:25.440
who've overheard someone in New York
saying something, and then they

365
00:19:25.440 --> 00:19:30.980
just block it. This is
persistent.info/right. So what over plot

366
00:19:30.980 --> 00:19:34.670
is, is it takes the
information from overheard in New York

367
00:19:35.720 --> 00:19:40.790
and then uses the Google
maps, API and plots where

368
00:19:40.790 --> 00:19:43.160
that thing was, that that
sentence, or that little story

369
00:19:43.160 --> 00:19:47.150
was overheard and then labels
it on the site. That's

370
00:19:47.150 --> 00:19:49.940
crazy. So go to over
plot and then click, click

371
00:19:49.940 --> 00:19:52.670
like a click Chelsea. That's
a neighborhood in a, in

372
00:19:52.670 --> 00:19:55.820
Midtown, right in lower Midtown.
So then click there and

373
00:19:55.820 --> 00:19:59.540
then click on one of
the, the numbers there. And

374
00:19:59.540 --> 00:20:02.990
you'll see someone said this
on the corner of 27th

375
00:20:02.990 --> 00:20:06.470
and sixth and well, I'm
even looking for one. That's

376
00:20:06.470 --> 00:20:10.610
not offensive. And I can't
find one cause they're that,

377
00:20:11.650 --> 00:20:14.810
that, they're that kind of
over the top. Wow. Yeah.

378
00:20:14.810 --> 00:20:17.330
Here's one here. So a
little girl on the corner

379
00:20:17.330 --> 00:20:21.500
of 26, between sixth and
Broadway says, mama, no, don't

380
00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:25.730
walk away. Someone might take
me weird. So there's, that

381
00:20:25.730 --> 00:20:28.820
was overheard and someone blogged
it and thought it was

382
00:20:28.820 --> 00:20:32.060
funny. And now they, so
here's like a real time

383
00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:36.980
conversation, you know, things happening
on online. And they've got

384
00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:39.290
an they've overloaded. Now, this
isn't particularly interesting information. I

385
00:20:39.290 --> 00:20:43.340
wanted my GPS, but it
shows that the, this over

386
00:20:43.340 --> 00:20:47.000
plotting of data that I
might want, whether it be

387
00:20:47.710 --> 00:20:51.640
data, maybe I, maybe I'm
a wardriving and I want

388
00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:55.000
to see wireless information. I
should be able to have

389
00:20:55.030 --> 00:20:59.830
a, a GPS that's a
big, giant, beautiful LCD screen

390
00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.670
that can hook up to
Google and mashup, whatever information

391
00:21:03.670 --> 00:21:06.190
that I want. Why, why
is it the Google maps

392
00:21:06.220 --> 00:21:09.910
and live.com and virtual earth
get all the fun? Why

393
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:11.920
can't my device in my
car, get all that kind

394
00:21:11.920 --> 00:21:14.410
of fun. Now I tell
this to my boss and

395
00:21:14.410 --> 00:21:16.720
he says, well, you know,
you're not, you're asking for

396
00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:20.170
too much. Most people don't
know RSS exists, right? The

397
00:21:20.170 --> 00:21:22.480
group of people that are
making mashups is like a

398
00:21:22.480 --> 00:21:27.700
0.0, 1% of people even
care to do this kind

399
00:21:27.700 --> 00:21:30.970
of stuff. But that really
seems like a valuable, valuable

400
00:21:30.970 --> 00:21:33.250
thing. It could be used
to do some very valuable

401
00:21:33.250 --> 00:21:36.160
things. Yeah. I could put
my friends on there. I

402
00:21:36.160 --> 00:21:38.500
could. I mean, there's just,
there's all sorts of stuff

403
00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:42.490
that could potentially be. We
overlaid, you could take a

404
00:21:42.490 --> 00:21:46.300
photograph with a wire with
a phone or a phone

405
00:21:46.300 --> 00:21:50.410
or a camera with wireless
while you're somewhere like maybe,

406
00:21:50.410 --> 00:21:52.300
you know how you you're
driving along when you're on

407
00:21:52.300 --> 00:21:56.680
vacation, you stop, you take
a picture. Why can't that

408
00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.300
then be plotted and put
on your GPS stopped and

409
00:22:01.300 --> 00:22:04.800
took a picture. So I,
they do have cameras that

410
00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:08.700
have GPS units in them.
And, and actually this has

411
00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:10.920
been around for a while.
Sure. We talked about this

412
00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:14.010
on our <inaudible> that's right.
Yeah. And, and you can

413
00:22:14.010 --> 00:22:17.610
do basically marking up of
that. You can do geo

414
00:22:17.610 --> 00:22:22.050
mapping of this information, take
that and code it. Most,

415
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.900
most cameras actually now store
in the JPEG, what's called

416
00:22:24.900 --> 00:22:29.370
the <inaudible> right. It's metadata
for JPEG file. Right? They'll

417
00:22:29.370 --> 00:22:32.340
add on, you know, these,
these, these GPS cameras will

418
00:22:32.370 --> 00:22:34.860
they'll add on the latitude
and longitude. Yeah. But I

419
00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.390
want all these things to
talk to each other. I've

420
00:22:36.390 --> 00:22:39.090
got a Bluetooth Blackberry, I've
got a big shiny GPS

421
00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:42.570
and an eye camera, and
none of them chat with

422
00:22:42.570 --> 00:22:44.580
each other about what's going
on. You ought to do

423
00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:47.340
a show on cameras because
there's some really cool stuff

424
00:22:47.340 --> 00:22:50.640
out there. You do have
a camera that allows for

425
00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:54.150
annotation, you know, where you
can actually speak and say

426
00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:57.240
something that goes along with
this. Right. And I'll get

427
00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.050
a wave file next to
Yeah. The, the, the ones

428
00:23:01.050 --> 00:23:02.760
that I've seen. I don't
know if there are some

429
00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.350
out there that do this,
but the ones that I've

430
00:23:04.350 --> 00:23:07.980
seen require you to go
back through all your pictures

431
00:23:07.980 --> 00:23:11.040
in annotate at a later
time, I think that's BS.

432
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:13.620
I think you should be
able to click. And right

433
00:23:13.620 --> 00:23:16.200
then and there say, while
you're taking the picture, what

434
00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:19.020
this is, cause that's when
you know, right. You don't

435
00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.100
always remember. Yeah. You know,
I cannot gain from other,

436
00:23:23.130 --> 00:23:25.350
why can't it pull from
the kind of the ether,

437
00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:28.860
right? Like where were, where
was I? Right. You might

438
00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:31.350
want to hear people shouting,
hooray, and then take a

439
00:23:31.350 --> 00:23:34.350
picture while they're shouting it
or whatever, whatever, you know,

440
00:23:34.350 --> 00:23:37.230
group of people. But maybe
that there are cameras that

441
00:23:37.230 --> 00:23:40.230
do this out already. I
just haven't seen them. Yeah.

442
00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:43.980
I haven't Show on cameras.
We should investigate some of

443
00:23:43.980 --> 00:23:47.030
that stuff. Yeah. That's a
good idea. There's The pro-sumer

444
00:23:47.030 --> 00:23:49.700
level camera then there's the
snapshots. Right, right. More and

445
00:23:49.700 --> 00:23:51.830
more of the digital camera
world seems to be split

446
00:23:51.830 --> 00:23:54.170
between folks that want a
tiny camera that fits in

447
00:23:54.170 --> 00:23:57.050
their pocket. And folks that
want a big Canon EOS

448
00:23:57.050 --> 00:24:00.560
with exchangeable lenses and all
that kind of thing. And

449
00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:03.170
I've noticed more and more
that the quality is really

450
00:24:03.260 --> 00:24:05.690
amazing on those nicer cameras,
but yeah. But you've got

451
00:24:05.690 --> 00:24:08.710
to carry around that big
thing. Right? Yeah. We have

452
00:24:08.710 --> 00:24:11.890
some other things to talk
about that aren't GPS related.

453
00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:14.980
Yeah. Cause this is minutia,
right? It's minutia, mostly GPS,

454
00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:18.890
minutia, but some other random
stuff. Okay. You know, I

455
00:24:18.910 --> 00:24:21.910
told you recently I tried
office 2007. Yep. I'm running

456
00:24:21.910 --> 00:24:23.680
it at home now. I
got it working at home,

457
00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:26.170
but I gave up on
it at work to destroy

458
00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.350
my work machine, mostly because
of some problems with outlook

459
00:24:29.350 --> 00:24:32.140
and some MSI trouble I
had. But I wanted to

460
00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:34.300
show some people office 2007.
I was trying to figure

461
00:24:34.300 --> 00:24:35.650
out how I was going
to do this. So it

462
00:24:35.650 --> 00:24:38.170
was getting ready to build
a VM virtual machine and

463
00:24:38.170 --> 00:24:40.510
put office on it. And
then I find out that

464
00:24:40.510 --> 00:24:46.030
there's a test drive online
shrinks.com/ <inaudible> that lets you

465
00:24:46.060 --> 00:24:49.990
log in to a terminal
server session and play with

466
00:24:49.990 --> 00:24:53.620
office. Hey, this is pretty
cool. Interestingly, it's not terminal

467
00:24:53.620 --> 00:24:56.560
server. It's actually Citrix. Remember
those guys? Yeah. It's an

468
00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:59.140
active X control. And then
they'll let you hook up

469
00:24:59.890 --> 00:25:02.440
to some super farm of
machines out there. Get your

470
00:25:02.440 --> 00:25:06.520
own desktop and run through
tutorials on whatever aspect of

471
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.820
2007 you want. Wow. Very
cool. Dennis, check it out.

472
00:25:09.850 --> 00:25:11.710
It's a little slow right
now because everyone else has

473
00:25:11.710 --> 00:25:15.010
discovered it too. Right. But
really neat way to sh

474
00:25:15.070 --> 00:25:17.800
to decide whether you think
office 2007 is worth trying.

475
00:25:18.430 --> 00:25:21.070
I really suggest go through
the word tutorial, spend some

476
00:25:21.070 --> 00:25:23.440
time with word that's really
the, the application, in my

477
00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:29.530
opinion, that that shines with
2007 Strengths are.com/ <inaudible>. Absolutely.

478
00:25:30.100 --> 00:25:31.750
So the other thing that
I thought that was pretty

479
00:25:31.750 --> 00:25:37.660
awesome today, also a piece
of minutia is a MSB.

480
00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:40.690
I've talked about this before,
but now it has a

481
00:25:40.690 --> 00:25:43.810
home has to be E
I S sorry. This is

482
00:25:43.810 --> 00:25:50.110
the Microsoft build Everett environment.
NSBE. Remember Everett was visual

483
00:25:50.110 --> 00:25:54.220
studio, 2003 Code name for
2003, right? This was a

484
00:25:54.280 --> 00:25:56.290
kind of a thing that
people were doing internally and

485
00:25:56.290 --> 00:25:57.730
you could get on the
beta for a while and

486
00:25:57.730 --> 00:25:59.620
then it didn't quite have
a home, but now it

487
00:25:59.620 --> 00:26:02.080
lives at code Plex. Right?
Code Plex is the new

488
00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:05.500
open source site that Microsoft's
got all of their, their

489
00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:08.200
shared source goodness up there.
Okay. And it shrinks their

490
00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:12.250
slash G seven J MSB
lives up there. And this

491
00:26:12.250 --> 00:26:14.740
is a fantastic thing. I
loved it before. I love

492
00:26:14.740 --> 00:26:18.550
it. Now that it's released
this, lets you build one,

493
00:26:18.550 --> 00:26:24.640
one applications using visual studio,
2005 projects. Oh cool. So

494
00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:27.010
this isn't an upgrade, right?
This isn't the whole web

495
00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:30.280
application project upgrade. But this
is like, Hey, I've got

496
00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:32.200
a machine that's got done
at one one on it,

497
00:26:32.710 --> 00:26:36.190
but I only have visual
studio 2005. Maybe I want

498
00:26:36.190 --> 00:26:39.610
to build an application for.net.
One, one, or maybe I

499
00:26:39.610 --> 00:26:41.740
want to build an app
for both one, one and

500
00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:44.340
two. Oh, that's the thing
is if You want to

501
00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:47.280
support one, one and two.
Oh, which means XP service

502
00:26:47.280 --> 00:26:50.670
pack two, right? One, one
is now out there and

503
00:26:50.670 --> 00:26:53.820
mass, a lot of people
have the framework for one,

504
00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:55.290
one. Not a lot of
people have it for two.

505
00:26:55.290 --> 00:26:58.280
Oh. So you could just
build it for, for one,

506
00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:00.830
one and ship it for
one one, which is what

507
00:27:00.830 --> 00:27:03.260
we do with, with, And
what's cool is you can

508
00:27:03.260 --> 00:27:06.320
use visual studio 2005 with
all the cool clean, all

509
00:27:06.320 --> 00:27:10.040
the editor stuff. It's designer.
You get all that richness.

510
00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:12.800
But then when you hit
build, it's actually going to

511
00:27:12.800 --> 00:27:15.530
use a separate target file.
Cause ms. Bill has this

512
00:27:15.530 --> 00:27:18.770
notion of a Target's final
file and there's a, you

513
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.240
can also run it from
the command line. So you

514
00:27:20.240 --> 00:27:23.450
could have your automated builds
target one, one. Yeah. So

515
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.790
if you're a company that's
really thinking about moving towards

516
00:27:25.790 --> 00:27:28.580
two. Oh, but you're just
not quite there. This is

517
00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:31.340
a great way to give
the developers the feeling of,

518
00:27:31.730 --> 00:27:34.760
of the two hour development
experience, but hedge your bets

519
00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:38.030
on the runtime. Now you
have to be using a

520
00:27:38.030 --> 00:27:41.240
1.1 compatible stuff in the
framework, right? You wouldn't be

521
00:27:41.240 --> 00:27:43.070
able to use any of
the new tools, Right. You're

522
00:27:43.070 --> 00:27:46.010
actually going to be building
against dotnet one, one using

523
00:27:46.070 --> 00:27:50.540
the net one, one compiler.
So if you used some

524
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:54.050
feature or visual studio, 2005
allowed you to add some

525
00:27:54.080 --> 00:27:57.020
reference that was inappropriate, you'd
hear about it during the

526
00:27:57.380 --> 00:28:01.340
Data binding stuff, for example,
won't work Exactly. Now, additionally,

527
00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:06.050
there's also some verification scripts
for FX cop that are

528
00:28:06.050 --> 00:28:11.180
built into MSB that lets
you kind of verify that

529
00:28:11.180 --> 00:28:13.190
what you're doing is the
right thing to do. And

530
00:28:13.340 --> 00:28:16.640
MSB really suggest that you
use this FX cop, right?

531
00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:19.490
FX cop is the tool
that, that got done. That

532
00:28:19.490 --> 00:28:22.310
team. That's a code analysis
tool that checks for defects

533
00:28:22.910 --> 00:28:26.930
and checks for correctness of
code. So you are definitely

534
00:28:26.930 --> 00:28:29.300
in a weird place when
you might be doing either

535
00:28:29.300 --> 00:28:32.870
cross compilation or thinking to
Oh, and writing one, one,

536
00:28:32.870 --> 00:28:35.570
there's some thought that is
involved, but just the fact

537
00:28:35.570 --> 00:28:38.870
that I can have a
single IDE on my system

538
00:28:38.870 --> 00:28:41.630
and build to both is
pretty awesome. So definitely check

539
00:28:41.630 --> 00:28:46.340
that out. Shrink stir slash
G seven G. Excellent. Yeah.

540
00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:50.660
Well Scott, that's a show.
Fantastic. Excellent. Thanks. Thanks for

541
00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:53.090
sharing. You're going to check
out that movie. I mean,

542
00:28:53.090 --> 00:28:55.010
I have one in my
car, but it's all, you

543
00:28:55.010 --> 00:28:56.750
know, we don't have one
in the other car. So

544
00:28:56.750 --> 00:29:00.710
the wife and I are
thinking about going to Spain,

545
00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:03.800
It's over and I just
keep having this dream of

546
00:29:03.800 --> 00:29:07.250
me walking around Europe with
a little portable deck of

547
00:29:07.250 --> 00:29:09.920
cards, GPS telling me where,
How cool would that be?

548
00:29:10.370 --> 00:29:13.820
Very cool. Very cool. Alright,
Scott, until next week and

549
00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.460
for you, the listener, we'll
see you next week on

550
00:29:16.460 --> 00:29:17.090
Hansel minutes.
