Hey friends, we have a
new sponsor today, and I

2
00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:04.350
want to make sure that
you support them because they

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:09.270
make Hansel minutes possible. Raven
DB, it's a document database

4
00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.770
that's non-relational and fully transactional.
It's available for windows and

5
00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:18.570
Linux with official client API
APIs for.net. The JVM go

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:22.410
Ruby, no JS and Python.
Raven DB is designed for

7
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.010
high performance handling tens of
thousands of requests, even on

8
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.310
a single node. Now, Raven
DB is capable of on

9
00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:33.810
the fly optimization, dynamic indexes,
and much more. It has

10
00:00:33.810 --> 00:00:36.600
a fully loaded gooey, which
means it's simpler to operate

11
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:39.300
and you don't need, you
know, arcane incantations on the

12
00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:41.970
command line. It just works.
It's fast and it's right.

00:00:48.330 --> 00:01:05.400
N db.net. I hope you
check it out. Hi, this

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:07.740
is Scott Hanselman. This is
another episode of Hansel minutes.

16
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.590
Today. I am talking with
Katy McCaffrey. She is the

17
00:01:10.590 --> 00:01:14.670
engineering lead on Azure sphere.
That's a cool code name.

18
00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:17.030
Is that like a code
name or a thing? No,

19
00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:20.030
this is our official real
name now. Awesome. I like

20
00:01:20.030 --> 00:01:22.220
cool names. I'd hate us
to call it something boring.

21
00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:24.970
Yeah, I'm pretty happy with
the name we got. It's

22
00:01:24.970 --> 00:01:27.560
it's exciting to have it
be public and out there.

23
00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.930
It's awesome. So I can
go up and just, you

24
00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:33.710
know, search for Azure sphere
or microsoft.com/azure hyphen sphere. And

25
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:37.370
it says a solution for
creating highly secured connected MCU

26
00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:40.220
devices, MCU. I had to
go and search for what

27
00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:44.300
that is. Yeah. So an
MCU is a microcontroller unit.

28
00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.690
So you can think of
these as really tiny chips

29
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:51.140
about the size of like
your thumbnail or a fingernail.

30
00:01:51.890 --> 00:01:54.260
And, and we like to
differentiate this. This is basically

31
00:01:54.260 --> 00:01:56.990
smaller than if you think
about in our Duino or

32
00:01:56.990 --> 00:02:00.860
a raspberry PI, usually an
MCU, you can think about

33
00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:02.360
it. If it's something in
your house, it has a

34
00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:06.650
button or a light, or
maybe a really low power

35
00:02:06.660 --> 00:02:10.970
display, like a monochromatic display.
That's probably running an MCU.

36
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.390
Okay. So I've got lots
of raspberry pies, but I

37
00:02:14.390 --> 00:02:16.760
can boot those up into
a desktop and they run

38
00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:19.100
like a, I don't know
what the right word is,

39
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:21.680
a proper OSTP or a
desktop OS. Like they have

40
00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:25.040
a lot of weight to
them. Yeah. So those are,

41
00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:29.120
those are bigger than microcontrollers
because they're doing more things

42
00:02:29.120 --> 00:02:31.430
they have, you can think
about it, a high level

43
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.620
operating system that has a
user space in it as

44
00:02:33.620 --> 00:02:36.500
well. Ah, the user space.
Okay. But I'm looking for

45
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.620
example, at an Xbox controller
that happens to be on

46
00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.770
my desk here that probably
doesn't have an operating system.

47
00:02:43.880 --> 00:02:46.670
It has an operating system
of sorts, but it's not

48
00:02:46.670 --> 00:02:48.680
as fully featured as you
would think of as like

49
00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.530
your traditional windows or Linux
or do we know operating

50
00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:54.440
system. So then all these
things that I'm looking at,

51
00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:57.410
they're scattered on my desk
here. I've got a, you

52
00:02:57.410 --> 00:03:01.450
know, USB to SD adapter
and I've got a tiny

53
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:05.260
link, SIS, a USB wifi
thing. You know, how can

54
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:07.810
I tell what's an MCU?
Is it have to be

55
00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:09.940
connected or does it have
to have Bluetooth or wifi

56
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:13.230
to be an MCU? So
MCU is traditionally, don't have

57
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.290
to be connected. And, and
most of them are not,

58
00:03:16.290 --> 00:03:20.670
for instance, there's 9 billion or
9 billion MCUs created every single

59
00:03:20.670 --> 00:03:23.040
year. So that's like a
lot of them they're kind

60
00:03:23.040 --> 00:03:25.440
of in everything like most
appliances in your house have

61
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:28.470
an MCU. You can think
of MCQs are usually in

62
00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:30.480
anything that has like a
switch or a pump that's

63
00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:34.950
controlled with some code, right?
It's just a very lightweight

64
00:03:36.210 --> 00:03:38.970
computer chip that you can
run sort of simple logic

65
00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:41.850
on to control things. But
now the interesting thing is,

66
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:44.310
is many of these are
becoming only like 1% of

67
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:46.950
them now are connected to
the internet, but that's sort

68
00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:49.710
of all changing, right? Everyone
wants to do IOT and

69
00:03:49.710 --> 00:03:52.920
have smart devices and extend
the cloud to the intelligent

70
00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.110
edge and bring that into
your home or your workplace

71
00:03:55.110 --> 00:03:58.770
or, or factories and make
that a richer experience where

72
00:03:58.770 --> 00:04:02.310
he gathered more data. Yeah.
And as a, as a

73
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.500
user, not as a developer,
but thinking in terms of

74
00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.290
a user, I can say
that I've got all these

75
00:04:07.290 --> 00:04:09.720
devices. As you know, I'm
kind of an early adopter,

76
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.140
I've got light bulbs and
switches and, and you know,

77
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:15.510
their voice controlled and stuff.
The thing is though, it

78
00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:19.170
all feels very tense. Like
I feel the psychic weight

79
00:04:19.590 --> 00:04:22.950
of these devices pressing on
me because like I bought

80
00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.650
this cool light bulb on
Kickstarter. And now that company

81
00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:27.690
has gone out of business,
which means that I now

82
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.210
have this device that has
a little operating system that

83
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:34.230
has no firmware updates ever.
And like that light bulb

84
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:36.510
is, it's silly to say
this, but it's stressing me

85
00:04:36.510 --> 00:04:39.330
out. Yeah. Cause it's talking
to the internet. Right. And

86
00:04:39.330 --> 00:04:42.210
so internet connectivity, it's sort
of this two way street

87
00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:45.420
where it provides a lot
of really useful functionality, right?

88
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.650
Like you can do a
lot of cool things with

89
00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:49.860
this light bulb or with,
you know, connected thermostat or

90
00:04:49.860 --> 00:04:53.280
even your refrigerator for instance.
Right. But then we've also

91
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:56.460
now invited attackers or hackers
into our homes by providing

92
00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:59.970
internet connected devices. And so
they love when things aren't

93
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:02.670
updated because they can find
an exploit and then use

94
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:05.190
it forever. Just think of
this as a scenario where

95
00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:07.770
you like come home and
you have, or you have

96
00:05:07.770 --> 00:05:10.500
an email in your inbox
that says, you know, give

97
00:05:10.500 --> 00:05:12.330
me five Bitcoin or I'm
going to melt all the

98
00:05:12.330 --> 00:05:14.850
ice cream in your freezer,
like, right. Like that's sort

99
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:17.610
of, you know, the world
we're in. And that's a

100
00:05:17.610 --> 00:05:22.410
funny example, but I think
there are real or ones

101
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:25.350
around like, you know, if
you think about like a

102
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:28.290
stove, for instance, like a
gas powered stove that you

103
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:30.420
could remotely turn on and
off like that could be

104
00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:33.840
weaponized because it's connected to
the internet where you could

105
00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:36.240
turn the gas on and
then later a hacker could

106
00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.030
remotely light the ignition. Yeah.
Well, I mean, keep in

107
00:05:39.030 --> 00:05:41.550
mind who you're talking to,
I've got an insulin pump

108
00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:44.670
that is ultimately cloud connected,
although there's a couple of

109
00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:48.300
bounces between the pump and
the, and the net. And

110
00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:50.940
there's been a lots of
examples of, you know, episodes

111
00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:53.190
of law and order where
some poor schmuck gets killed

112
00:05:53.190 --> 00:05:56.010
by a hacker cause they
deliver too much insulin. So

113
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:59.090
I think your point, you
know, these, the need for

114
00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.790
security is intense. Yeah. And,
and we really looked in,

115
00:06:03.790 --> 00:06:06.550
so what we designed Azure
sphere to be is from

116
00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:08.830
the ground up, let's think
about security and how we

117
00:06:08.830 --> 00:06:11.560
secure these internet connected devices
that are going to be

118
00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:15.340
prevalent in everywhere. Hmm. That's
interesting because I feel like

119
00:06:15.340 --> 00:06:17.920
the last, you know, five
or 10 years and watching

120
00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.920
this as a hobbyist and
getting involved in IOT, I'm

121
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:23.260
just buying all sorts of
chips that I see from

122
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.910
various vendors from overseas. And
they're all very hobbyist and

123
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:31.060
fun, but I feel like
if we were going to

124
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:33.730
go and secure them, we'd
be playing kind of whack-a-mole.

125
00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:37.810
And so you're saying that
Azure sphere is not just

126
00:06:38.470 --> 00:06:40.720
the cloud is not just
the S it's the chip

127
00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.930
dos and the cloud all
as one platform. Yes. So

128
00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:45.700
this is sort of like
the first end to end

129
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.220
holistic solution for all of
this. And one of the

130
00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:50.170
things that I think is
super cool about this project

131
00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:52.450
when I joined it about
a year ago, is this

132
00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:57.250
started in Microsoft research and
gala and hunt and crew

133
00:06:57.250 --> 00:06:59.740
basically spent some time looking
at what does it even

134
00:06:59.740 --> 00:07:03.400
mean to have secure connected
devices? Like what properties would

135
00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.020
we have to have? Let's
take a step back and

136
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:08.590
look at it from first
principles and take learnings from,

137
00:07:08.860 --> 00:07:11.830
you know, all of the
learnings from securing windows and

138
00:07:11.830 --> 00:07:15.430
updating windows over, you know,
however many years. And like,

139
00:07:15.430 --> 00:07:17.950
let's look at Xbox, right.
And what learnings can we

140
00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:21.550
get from, you know, 15
years of securing the Xbox.

141
00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:24.640
And so they published a
paper called the seven properties

142
00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:27.850
of highly secured devices. That
list the seven properties that

143
00:07:27.850 --> 00:07:30.130
you have to have that
we believe are fundamental to

144
00:07:30.130 --> 00:07:35.470
providing a secure, secure, connected
device. And then from that

145
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:39.130
Azure sphere was created to
like in re everything's rebuilt

146
00:07:39.130 --> 00:07:42.850
from the ground up to
fulfill those seven properties. Wow.

147
00:07:43.060 --> 00:07:45.910
And that PDF of course
is still available online. You

148
00:07:45.910 --> 00:07:47.770
can go and search for
it. It's off hangs off

149
00:07:47.770 --> 00:07:53.260
of microsoft.com/slash research. And it
talks about the hardware kind

150
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:55.900
of the, the root of
trust. They can, nothing is

151
00:07:55.900 --> 00:07:59.230
nothing is secure unless the
hardware and the has, has

152
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.680
crypto at the root level.
Yes. So, and what's cool

153
00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:04.420
about the seven properties is
if you go and look

154
00:08:04.420 --> 00:08:06.430
at them is, you know,
some of them we can

155
00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:08.200
do just in Silicon, like
the root of trust, like

156
00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:10.360
you mentioned, but some of
them, we actually need all

157
00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:14.170
three components, which is Silicon
operating system and cloud. So

158
00:08:14.170 --> 00:08:18.310
one that, that is called
renewable security is like actually

159
00:08:18.310 --> 00:08:20.680
providing updates, which you touched
on earlier. And so we

160
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.840
need Silicon and an operating
system that knows how to

161
00:08:22.840 --> 00:08:25.390
provide updates and then a
cloud service to actually push

162
00:08:25.390 --> 00:08:28.300
those updates out, which is
something that Azure sphere provides.

163
00:08:29.710 --> 00:08:31.630
It's a really, actually a
very, like you think about

164
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:33.850
reading a paper by a
bunch of PhDs might be

165
00:08:33.850 --> 00:08:36.250
really dull. It's actually quite
a good paper and it's

166
00:08:36.250 --> 00:08:37.780
quite easy to read. And
it says a lot of

167
00:08:37.780 --> 00:08:41.350
things that make you go,
Hmm, like common sense type

168
00:08:41.350 --> 00:08:44.080
stuff. But I like the
way that it phrases, it

169
00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:48.070
says single purpose hardware should
be immune to reuse for

170
00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:50.770
unintended actions. Like this is
a light switch. It should

171
00:08:50.770 --> 00:08:53.260
only switch on my light.
It should not kill my

172
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:56.370
family. Right. Yes. Would be
an ideal goal For a

173
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:00.830
light switch. So the idea
being that the, we want

174
00:09:00.830 --> 00:09:02.540
it to do its job
and do its job as

175
00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:04.910
intended. And it kind of
melt into the fabric of

176
00:09:04.910 --> 00:09:08.540
our lives as users, without
all the, like the psychic

177
00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:10.910
weight of my light bulb
stressing me out. That's one

178
00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:14.240
label that I bought on
Kickstarter. Imagine if you're a

179
00:09:14.240 --> 00:09:16.790
big car developer and you've
got now a, you know,

180
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:20.360
multimillion, multiple millions of cars
out there, or multiple million

181
00:09:21.050 --> 00:09:25.100
refrigerators, that that would be
very stressful. And they're refrigerator

182
00:09:25.100 --> 00:09:29.030
makers like we've seen on
Silicon Valley, people hacking into

183
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:31.790
appliances. Like that's not their
job to be worrying about

184
00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:34.730
that stuff. Right. And so
Azure sphere is basically sort

185
00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:37.670
of this turnkey solution where
we say, you know, like

186
00:09:37.910 --> 00:09:40.100
here's a, here's a tool,
here's a productivity tool and

187
00:09:40.150 --> 00:09:43.640
a solution basically, where if
you use an Azure sphere

188
00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:47.540
certified Silicon chip, and then
you get, once you buy

189
00:09:47.540 --> 00:09:50.240
the chip, you get licensed
to use the operating system

190
00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:52.580
for 10 years. And then
you also get 10 years

191
00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:56.360
of the security services guarding
that device. And then, so

192
00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.160
you just don't have to
worry about it, right? You

193
00:09:58.160 --> 00:10:01.430
could build the application for
your refrigerator or, you know,

194
00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:04.100
whatever you are building and
just think about that. And

195
00:10:04.100 --> 00:10:07.040
then we take care of
the security for you. So

196
00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:09.380
you say that it has
three components, Chipo S and

197
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:11.690
cloud connectivity. When you say
chip, like I know that

198
00:10:11.690 --> 00:10:14.210
we're in the surface business,
we make, we make computers

199
00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:16.370
now, although I'm sure that
we outsource a lot of

200
00:10:16.370 --> 00:10:18.620
the parts and stuff, are
we suddenly making chips or

201
00:10:18.620 --> 00:10:21.650
where do these chips come
from? Right. So the piece

202
00:10:21.650 --> 00:10:23.450
of Azure sphere, we, you
may have heard me say

203
00:10:23.450 --> 00:10:26.450
certified Azure sphere chips. So
we work with Silicon partners

204
00:10:26.450 --> 00:10:29.450
who actually produce Azure spirit
chips. And what makes it

205
00:10:29.450 --> 00:10:34.490
an Azure sphere chip is
that it has the plutonic

206
00:10:34.490 --> 00:10:38.120
security system is Silicon that
was developed by Microsoft and

207
00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:41.300
that we license royalty free
to these Silicon partners so

208
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.600
that they can then make
these chips. So media tech

209
00:10:44.630 --> 00:10:47.150
is our first partner that
is producing the first chip.

210
00:10:47.610 --> 00:10:49.190
And so you can go
look and see the specs

211
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:53.240
on their website, but, you
know, device manufacturers and whoever

212
00:10:53.240 --> 00:10:55.370
wants to buy these chips
would actually be buying them

213
00:10:55.370 --> 00:10:59.180
from the Silicon manufacturers. And
there therefore could be many,

214
00:10:59.180 --> 00:11:00.740
many different skews in the
future. I think there are

215
00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:03.770
12 parts Silicon partner's announced
on the website right now.

216
00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:06.050
I see. So I'm going
to ask you a very

217
00:11:06.050 --> 00:11:08.240
ignorant question because I, you
know, I, the most I

218
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:09.770
ever did in the hardware
space was I made a

219
00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.110
clock. I had a bunch
of, a bunch of NAND

220
00:11:12.110 --> 00:11:16.690
Gates. So we we've designed,
or Microsoft is designed the

221
00:11:16.790 --> 00:11:19.330
Silicon in the sense that
they would give or licensed

222
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:23.150
the plans and say, here's
the layout, here's the Silicon.

223
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:25.490
And how you lay it
down, like just as I

224
00:11:25.490 --> 00:11:28.070
give you source code, but
you compile it. Yeah. And

225
00:11:28.070 --> 00:11:30.170
we actually give them like
a block. And so there

226
00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.960
will be that Pluton, runtime
subsystem on the chip, but

227
00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:38.150
there could also be additional
things like for instance, different

228
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:40.640
cores and, and some of
it, we do have specs

229
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:43.850
around, like, we have an
application core and a realtime

230
00:11:43.850 --> 00:11:47.450
core on, on these chips
and we call that across,

231
00:11:47.450 --> 00:11:49.820
over chips. So that's a
requirement, but there's others. There's

232
00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:51.500
other things that go in.
So it might be like

233
00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:52.790
a, it's a, you can
think of it as like

234
00:11:52.790 --> 00:11:55.360
an and some in some
code that I give you.

235
00:11:55.860 --> 00:11:57.660
I got you. I got
ya. And then the one

236
00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.400
from media tech, and you
can go up and search

237
00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:02.040
for this. If you'd like,
it's got an arm processor,

238
00:12:02.040 --> 00:12:04.530
it's got two general purpose
ones. It also has a

239
00:12:04.530 --> 00:12:07.620
dedicated wifi subsystem. So it
is connected by it's by

240
00:12:07.620 --> 00:12:10.140
default. Yes. And all the
address here, your certified chips

241
00:12:10.140 --> 00:12:13.800
will be connected by default.
Cool. Now is I'm making

242
00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.640
a refrigerator. Do I build
a bunch of stuff that

243
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:19.620
I know how to build
as a refrigerator manufacturer? And

244
00:12:19.620 --> 00:12:23.310
then there's a, a thumbnail
sized hole in my, in

245
00:12:23.310 --> 00:12:25.770
my board. And that's where
I pop the Azure sphere

246
00:12:25.770 --> 00:12:28.980
in. Yeah. And so that's
up to obviously the device

247
00:12:28.980 --> 00:12:31.410
manufacturer about how they want
to lay out their boards,

248
00:12:31.410 --> 00:12:34.710
but wherever you would put
your chip on your board,

249
00:12:34.740 --> 00:12:36.390
that's, that's where you would
place it. And then you

250
00:12:36.390 --> 00:12:39.150
might, there's a, this is
a whole very complex beast,

251
00:12:39.150 --> 00:12:41.760
right. So yes, you take
our chip, you put it

252
00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:43.500
on the board and then
you could design your own

253
00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.260
board from there. So the
whole point is though, that

254
00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:49.020
would be secure. Do we,
are we going to offer

255
00:12:49.590 --> 00:12:52.320
as, as you're going to
offer like, well, this part

256
00:12:52.330 --> 00:12:55.020
secure, cause it's Azure sphere,
but this other stuff around

257
00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:56.880
it that I made when
I did my refrigerator's not

258
00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:58.890
secure because I did it
wrong or I didn't know

259
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:01.980
what it was. Yeah. So
that's a great question. So

260
00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:06.570
we, part of the operating
system, that's super cool. I

261
00:13:06.570 --> 00:13:09.210
think about the, we call
it a high level operating

262
00:13:09.210 --> 00:13:11.010
system that we built from
the ground up to be

263
00:13:11.010 --> 00:13:16.080
secure has basically an application
sandbox. And so as a

264
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:19.800
device manufacturer, you would write
your refrigerator app and then

265
00:13:19.830 --> 00:13:22.590
you would put it in
our application sandbox. And so

266
00:13:22.590 --> 00:13:25.470
it's actually a multilayered operating
system. Whereas if you think

267
00:13:25.470 --> 00:13:29.160
of an artist toss that
usually runs on these devices,

268
00:13:29.430 --> 00:13:32.070
it's all like one big
component. And so it's, once

269
00:13:32.070 --> 00:13:34.350
you compromise any of it,
whether it be the application

270
00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:37.620
or the Colonel, the whole
thing is compromised. We actually

271
00:13:37.620 --> 00:13:40.350
have different layers. Like you
could think of in your

272
00:13:40.350 --> 00:13:44.250
traditional kernel, like user space
and like more like the

273
00:13:44.250 --> 00:13:48.210
kernel space and things like
that. So device manufacturers can

274
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:51.030
run in their application sandbox.
And even if, for instance,

275
00:13:51.030 --> 00:13:56.280
there was a vulnerability that
was discovered in their application,

276
00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:58.260
they could then push an
update over there to fix

277
00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:01.050
that. And the rest of
our operating system would ensure

278
00:14:01.050 --> 00:14:05.280
that that, that application got
updated. Now you said R

279
00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:08.340
toss, R T O S
real time operating system. Yeah.

280
00:14:08.370 --> 00:14:12.600
So that's traditionally what's runs
on microcontroller devices. This is

281
00:14:12.600 --> 00:14:17.100
actually a super old operating
system. It's was built originally

282
00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.310
before devices were even connected
to the internet. Right. And

283
00:14:20.310 --> 00:14:24.030
so internet connectivity and security
has sort of been added

284
00:14:24.030 --> 00:14:26.910
on and sort of like
taped, you know, sort of

285
00:14:26.910 --> 00:14:29.640
duct taped on, and these
features have been added, but

286
00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:32.370
there's still vulnerabilities that keep
popping up in that and

287
00:14:32.370 --> 00:14:35.880
things like that. And so
we actually built one from

288
00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:39.390
scratch to go and say,
let's, what would it look

289
00:14:39.390 --> 00:14:41.880
like to devise an operating
system for these small devices

290
00:14:42.750 --> 00:14:45.240
from the ground up? So
that it's purpose built for

291
00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:50.640
security You, well, you've seen
probably online, everyone lose their

292
00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:54.440
minds when the Sphero S
like announcement came out and

293
00:14:54.830 --> 00:14:56.840
there's a whole bunch of
stuff to read about. I've

294
00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:59.540
got dozens and dozens of
pages open. I read the

295
00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:04.580
original, the original PDF about
the characteristics, what need, but

296
00:15:04.700 --> 00:15:08.240
the, the title of the
headline is like Microsoft makes

297
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.340
its own Linux. And I'm
like, this seems a lot

298
00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:13.340
different than what I thought
people think, think is being

299
00:15:13.340 --> 00:15:16.760
made. So why did everyone,
like, I don't know, focus

300
00:15:16.760 --> 00:15:19.570
on that. I mean, I
think so. Yeah. So I'll

301
00:15:19.570 --> 00:15:22.150
address the question is our
operating system, our high level

302
00:15:22.150 --> 00:15:24.880
operating system does run a
custom Linux kernel. It has

303
00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:27.820
sort of four layers, which
is our security monitor, our

304
00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:34.930
custom Linux kernel sort of
like applications that run as

305
00:15:34.930 --> 00:15:37.420
part of the operating system.
And then there's like your

306
00:15:37.420 --> 00:15:40.000
app that runs. And so
the custom Linux kernel, I

307
00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.820
think, you know, it's funny.
I feel like every time

308
00:15:42.820 --> 00:15:45.190
I see this, like everyone
forgets that Microsoft has a

309
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:49.060
long storied history with supporting
Linux, right? Like 40% of

310
00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:51.190
the VMs that run in
Azure are Linux based. But

311
00:15:51.190 --> 00:15:53.380
I think it's just, you
know, maybe some sticker shock

312
00:15:53.380 --> 00:15:57.430
over the history of Microsoft's
careers and having windows versus

313
00:15:57.430 --> 00:16:00.280
Linux and in this sort
of dichotomy folks have in

314
00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:03.490
their heads, but it's really
nothing new. Well, and it

315
00:16:03.490 --> 00:16:06.610
seems like a reasonable thing
to, to choose given the,

316
00:16:06.610 --> 00:16:08.770
the, the size of the
operating system and the modularity

317
00:16:08.770 --> 00:16:11.230
of it, as well as
the ubiquity of Lennox, I

318
00:16:11.230 --> 00:16:13.990
expect people would have code
that would become, would be

319
00:16:13.990 --> 00:16:17.290
more compatible because you're using
Linux as the operating system.

320
00:16:17.650 --> 00:16:19.750
Yeah. And I think, you
know, I don't even know

321
00:16:19.750 --> 00:16:22.330
that it's necessarily a size
issue. Like we've cut down

322
00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:25.000
the Linux kernel. We have
a custom Linux kernel, partly

323
00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:28.780
for security, because right. You
don't want to ship like

324
00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:31.690
a shell on these devices
because you don't need it.

325
00:16:31.690 --> 00:16:34.090
And so that's just a
different attack factor that we're

326
00:16:34.090 --> 00:16:37.390
not exposing. For instance, I
see. So this is not

327
00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.820
really an operating system, as
it is a paired down

328
00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:44.620
modified Colonel The, the Linux
bit is the accustom paired

329
00:16:44.620 --> 00:16:47.050
down kernel, and then we
have built an entire operating

330
00:16:47.050 --> 00:16:49.960
system. Right. I see. I
see. And then as, as

331
00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:51.880
open source, is this a
thing that I'm going to

332
00:16:51.880 --> 00:16:53.710
go and learn about and
poke about, or does it

333
00:16:53.710 --> 00:16:58.120
have to be open source?
So we will, we will

334
00:16:58.150 --> 00:17:01.240
basically follow the license, the
GPL two V two licenses.

335
00:17:01.240 --> 00:17:03.580
And so there will be
more information on, on what

336
00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.070
as we publish that and
adhere to that license in

337
00:17:06.070 --> 00:17:09.550
the future. That's cool. Hey

that's I N T U

348
00:17:51.090 --> 00:17:52.890
something that is going to
show up in my light

349
00:17:52.890 --> 00:17:54.870
bulb, or are we thinking
that this is not light

350
00:17:54.870 --> 00:17:58.790
bulb appropriate? So it depends.
Some of this is if

351
00:17:58.790 --> 00:18:01.640
you think about light bulbs
themselves, usually they run very,

352
00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:04.730
very small chips. Like sometimes
you might think if you're

353
00:18:04.730 --> 00:18:06.950
familiar with the arm ecosystem,
it's called like an M

354
00:18:06.950 --> 00:18:09.560
zero. So that's like a
really, really small chip. What

355
00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:12.200
is on the first Azure
sphere? Certified chip is an

356
00:18:12.200 --> 00:18:16.550
M four, which is a
slightly bigger realtime processing core.

357
00:18:16.550 --> 00:18:19.790
And then an a seven,
which is an application level

358
00:18:19.790 --> 00:18:23.210
processor, which is actually more
powerful. And so that's sort

359
00:18:23.210 --> 00:18:27.470
of new to the, the
ecosystem, but usually what's determined.

360
00:18:27.470 --> 00:18:29.300
There is based on the
cost of like, how much

361
00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.950
do you want your light
bulb to cost, right. Is

362
00:18:30.950 --> 00:18:33.050
how, how beefy of a
chip we could put in

363
00:18:33.050 --> 00:18:36.170
it. I see. And if
you look at this at

364
00:18:36.170 --> 00:18:40.130
the, at the diagrams online,
there's this whole family tree

365
00:18:40.130 --> 00:18:43.670
of these arm processors from
the tiniest to the, you

366
00:18:43.670 --> 00:18:45.470
know, the ones that went
on raw watches that go

367
00:18:45.470 --> 00:18:47.420
all the way up and
you can run a whole,

368
00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.300
a whole computer almost. So
this is the, the, the

369
00:18:53.300 --> 00:18:56.810
ultra low power M zero
is maybe sometime in the

370
00:18:56.810 --> 00:19:00.290
future, but you're starting at
the end for, Well, I

371
00:19:00.290 --> 00:19:02.570
mean, our chip does rent
have a couple or sorry,

372
00:19:02.630 --> 00:19:05.420
MTK chip does have two
and fours on it and

373
00:19:05.420 --> 00:19:07.520
an eight, seven processor. So
it actually has multiple cores.

374
00:19:08.130 --> 00:19:11.150
And so we, while we
realize that we're sort of

375
00:19:11.150 --> 00:19:15.260
not targeting the super, super
low end MCUs in, in

376
00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.840
the current skews that are
being built by our Silicon

377
00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:22.550
manufacturers right now, Where do
you see the, the cloud

378
00:19:22.550 --> 00:19:24.710
side then? What is, what
is the thing in the,

379
00:19:24.710 --> 00:19:27.500
in the cloud that supports
these tiny devices? Cause on

380
00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.560
the tiny devices they've got,
of course limited, limited everything.

381
00:19:30.590 --> 00:19:33.050
They are limited by the
design, but the cloud is

382
00:19:33.050 --> 00:19:36.020
the exact opposite by design.
It is unlimited and infinite.

383
00:19:36.380 --> 00:19:40.190
Yeah. So what's super cool.
So I'm maybe I'm biased

384
00:19:40.190 --> 00:19:43.700
because I run the cloud
security services. But what I

385
00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.470
think is super cool is
it provides a couple of

386
00:19:45.470 --> 00:19:49.460
key features. One of them
is certificate based authentication via

387
00:19:49.490 --> 00:19:53.630
remote device authentication and attestation.
And I'll get into more

388
00:19:53.630 --> 00:19:56.570
what those mean there's renewable
security, which I briefly mentioned

389
00:19:56.570 --> 00:19:58.940
earlier. So you can think
of like providing operating system

390
00:19:58.940 --> 00:20:02.150
updates and a secure pipeline
for device manufacturers to provide

391
00:20:02.150 --> 00:20:05.510
their own updates for their
applications to the devices. And

392
00:20:05.510 --> 00:20:08.180
then the third one is
failure reporting. So these actually

393
00:20:08.180 --> 00:20:12.140
aligned with our seven properties.
So we proactively get information

394
00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:14.510
about the dice device about
when it's crashing and when

395
00:20:14.510 --> 00:20:18.020
like things are failing so
that we can detect potential

396
00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:22.700
attacks that are brewing as
people probe to see usually

397
00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:25.010
a, an attack will be
predicated by, you'll see a

398
00:20:25.010 --> 00:20:26.690
bunch of crashes as people
are trying to probe a

399
00:20:26.690 --> 00:20:29.420
system to try and do
a buffer overflow or whatever

400
00:20:29.420 --> 00:20:31.610
their attack vector is. So
the cloud does sort of

401
00:20:31.610 --> 00:20:33.560
all of this forward you,
I think one of the

402
00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.070
cooler ones that was like,
it took a while for

403
00:20:37.070 --> 00:20:39.440
it to sink in. And
then I didn't even realize

404
00:20:39.440 --> 00:20:41.450
this when I first started.
But basically if you think

405
00:20:41.450 --> 00:20:43.800
about default passwords, right? Like
we sort of realized this

406
00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.130
is a security industry, passwords
are not great. They're easily

407
00:20:46.130 --> 00:20:51.490
stealable or, or whatever. And
a lot of these IOT

408
00:20:51.490 --> 00:20:54.550
devices come with a default
password. And if you remember

409
00:20:54.550 --> 00:20:57.280
them, or I bought that
attack that happened a little

410
00:20:57.280 --> 00:21:00.040
over over a year ago,
I believe, or two years

411
00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:03.160
ago. Now that was a
D hackers exploiting the fact

412
00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.940
that these devices have default
passwords users often don't change

413
00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:09.910
them because like, you might
not even think about this

414
00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.700
thing being in your house.
And it's just a pain

415
00:21:12.700 --> 00:21:15.460
to go and change the
default password. And so they

416
00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.440
were able to then gain
control of these devices using

417
00:21:17.440 --> 00:21:20.020
just a default password. So
Azure sphere doesn't even have

418
00:21:20.020 --> 00:21:22.210
this attack vector cause we
don't use passwords anywhere on

419
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:26.250
the device. We issue certificates.
I see. Which is interesting.

420
00:21:26.250 --> 00:21:27.420
Cause it gets to that
point you made at the

421
00:21:27.420 --> 00:21:30.510
beginning, which is let's just
start from first principles. Right?

422
00:21:30.810 --> 00:21:35.400
Right. And so the cloud
security services will basically issue

423
00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.480
certificates to every Azure sphere
connected device to say that,

424
00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:42.180
yes, this is its own
device. Like every device gets

425
00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.510
its own certificate that uniquely
identifies that device and that

426
00:21:45.510 --> 00:21:48.030
it is running what we
consider to be valid, secure

427
00:21:48.030 --> 00:21:52.640
software. So it's actually doing
not only identity authentication, but

428
00:21:52.650 --> 00:21:56.070
attestation of the fact that
it's running valid software. I

429
00:21:56.070 --> 00:21:58.860
see. So the, the ISO
kind of that built in

430
00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.320
isolation means that if a
bad person gets a hold

431
00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:04.830
of something, whether it be
remotely or physically, you really

432
00:22:04.830 --> 00:22:08.550
are compartmentalized. Yeah. I mean,
so for whatever reason, if

433
00:22:08.550 --> 00:22:11.910
you could get a certificate
and run bad software on

434
00:22:11.910 --> 00:22:14.040
one device, you're only getting
a certificate for that single

435
00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:17.760
device. There's no like broad
attack vector here, right? There's

436
00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:20.880
no, there's no skeleton key
certificate for all the systems.

437
00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:24.030
Right. And what's actually super
cool about these certificates is

438
00:22:24.030 --> 00:22:27.240
that you use it to
authenticate to the cloud security

439
00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:30.270
services obviously. And then you
can also then take the

440
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:32.940
certificate as a device manufacturer
and use it to authenticate

441
00:22:32.940 --> 00:22:36.240
to your device applications. And
that could be in Azure,

442
00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.970
which there's like a great
story and path there. But

443
00:22:38.970 --> 00:22:40.710
if for whatever reason you
want to go and use

444
00:22:40.710 --> 00:22:42.750
a different cloud, because maybe
you already have that set

445
00:22:42.750 --> 00:22:47.190
up like AWS or Google,
or you have your own

446
00:22:47.370 --> 00:22:50.490
custom server servers. Like you
can take that certificate and

447
00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:54.630
use that with any service.
When, when I heard, you

448
00:22:54.630 --> 00:22:56.400
know, I've, I've met, we've
hung up before I met

449
00:22:56.400 --> 00:23:00.870
you. And you're always doing
amazing stuff. You worked, you

450
00:23:00.870 --> 00:23:03.150
worked at Microsoft, you worked
on halo, you worked at

451
00:23:03.150 --> 00:23:05.760
Twitter. And then I heard
that you were coming back

452
00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.450
to work on this. And,
and I first I was

453
00:23:09.450 --> 00:23:12.750
like, well, it doesn't sound
like, like I think of

454
00:23:12.750 --> 00:23:15.540
you as like the giant
cloud scale person, like when

455
00:23:15.540 --> 00:23:17.280
you went to Twitter, I
was like, Oh, she's going

456
00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.160
to go and do stuff
of even larger scale. Like

457
00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.440
that's always been your thing.
And now I'm thinking about

458
00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.070
these tiny little devices and
I'm like, why are you

459
00:23:26.070 --> 00:23:29.430
doing this? Yeah. So, I
mean, so the devices themselves

460
00:23:29.430 --> 00:23:31.650
are small and the code
that runs on the devices

461
00:23:31.650 --> 00:23:33.990
is small. But when you
think about them in aggregate,

462
00:23:33.990 --> 00:23:37.110
right, like 9 billion MCUs, the
market is 9 billion MCs are

463
00:23:37.110 --> 00:23:40.320
being produced every single year.
You know, even if we

464
00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:42.630
only have a fraction of
them hitting our services, that'll

465
00:23:42.630 --> 00:23:45.500
actually be bigger than anything
I've ever built a in

466
00:23:45.500 --> 00:23:47.840
the past. This is actually
even an even bigger, large

467
00:23:47.840 --> 00:23:51.080
scale challenge for, you know,
for the services I've built

468
00:23:51.230 --> 00:23:55.030
prior to this. I see.
So this is well in

469
00:23:55.030 --> 00:23:57.700
your, the stuff that you
work on, it's a giant,

470
00:23:57.700 --> 00:24:01.450
giant scale. Yes. It's a
giant scale. I still find

471
00:24:01.450 --> 00:24:03.940
that incredibly interesting. And then,
you know, I was also

472
00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:06.520
very enticed by the security
aspect of it. This is

473
00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:09.130
personally like I've been watching
the IOT space for a

474
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.700
long time and I think
it's super cool, but also

475
00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:16.870
realizing that like there, isn't
a great security story around

476
00:24:16.870 --> 00:24:19.390
a lot of the devices
out there currently. Right. And

477
00:24:19.390 --> 00:24:23.440
so I think in order
to enable like, you know,

478
00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:26.950
more device manufacturers and people
to be more productive and

479
00:24:26.950 --> 00:24:29.260
do this safely, there needs
to be a great security

480
00:24:29.260 --> 00:24:31.930
story out there. And so
this sort of aligned with

481
00:24:31.930 --> 00:24:36.340
that interest. So I think
the impact is huge because

482
00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:38.890
we could build things that
we can now trust and

483
00:24:38.890 --> 00:24:42.610
put in our homes. W
can you, maybe this is

484
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.460
a appropriate, maybe it's not,
if you talk about this

485
00:24:45.460 --> 00:24:48.190
thing that you worked on
before distributed sagas and does

486
00:24:48.190 --> 00:24:50.950
that relate to the stuff
that you're doing now? So

487
00:24:50.950 --> 00:24:55.420
we're not using distributed sagas
at currently right now that

488
00:24:55.420 --> 00:24:57.460
doesn't outline it. So for
those listening, who might not

489
00:24:57.460 --> 00:25:00.820
know distributed sagas are a
pattern for doing sort of

490
00:25:01.180 --> 00:25:04.480
long live transactions and distributed
systems, except for we don't

491
00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:07.240
provide, it's not a full
blown, distributed transaction, but it

492
00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:10.480
is a pattern for insurance.
Something either all happens or

493
00:25:10.480 --> 00:25:15.100
doesn't happen in a rollback
strategy. So I I've used

494
00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:17.080
this tribute as August and
halo. I've used them at

495
00:25:17.080 --> 00:25:21.850
Twitter right now. We don't
currently have an implementation in

496
00:25:21.850 --> 00:25:23.740
this stack. That doesn't mean
we wouldn't use it in

497
00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:27.130
the future. I see. Okay.
So sagas would be for

498
00:25:27.130 --> 00:25:31.450
like big giant two phase
commit, huge transact cloud scale

499
00:25:31.450 --> 00:25:34.810
transactions. Yeah. So the, the
example I use a lot

500
00:25:34.810 --> 00:25:37.600
is if you're like booking
on a travel site, for

501
00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:40.390
instance, you might want to
book a car or rental

502
00:25:40.390 --> 00:25:42.610
car or a hotel and
a plane, and those are

503
00:25:42.610 --> 00:25:45.460
all talking to three different
microservices, right. That don't even

504
00:25:45.460 --> 00:25:49.120
have the same storage behind
them probably. And so how

505
00:25:49.120 --> 00:25:51.880
do you ensure that either
you get all three or

506
00:25:51.880 --> 00:25:53.800
if you can't get all
three, you have to like

507
00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:56.620
roll back the operation that
you ensure that the roll

508
00:25:56.620 --> 00:25:59.230
back complete successfully so that
you end up eventually in

509
00:25:59.230 --> 00:26:02.320
the state of you either
hold all the reservations or

510
00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:05.440
holding none of them. I
see. So part of the

511
00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:07.750
big scale stuff that you've
worked on, but not, not

512
00:26:07.810 --> 00:26:11.740
currently specific to anything around
sphere, maybe someone who was

513
00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.960
doing business stuff on top
of all of this would

514
00:26:14.050 --> 00:26:17.290
implement something like that, but
not related. Yeah. And I

515
00:26:17.290 --> 00:26:21.460
think as the sphere security
services grow, we might find

516
00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.130
a great use case where
building bringing this in makes

517
00:26:24.130 --> 00:26:27.430
a lot of sense When
I'm digging into the seven

518
00:26:27.430 --> 00:26:31.840
properties of highly secure devices,
paper, it's always talking about

519
00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:35.600
defense and depth and compartmentalization
and certificates. You know, I

520
00:26:35.620 --> 00:26:37.450
always brings me back to
that joke that the most

521
00:26:37.450 --> 00:26:39.760
secure device is one that
is not connected to the

522
00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:42.940
internet, but I'm curious, is
it just a constant series

523
00:26:42.940 --> 00:26:45.300
of offs? It's like, well,
you know, we really just

524
00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:47.670
should not be connected at
all at this point. I

525
00:26:47.670 --> 00:26:49.890
mean, you're asking for it
when you put anything on

526
00:26:49.890 --> 00:26:53.270
the internet these days. So
I think, you know, it's

527
00:26:53.270 --> 00:26:56.810
definitely a, anytime you put
something on the internet you

528
00:26:56.810 --> 00:26:58.700
have now opened it up
to being attacked, right. It's

529
00:26:58.700 --> 00:27:01.640
a two way street, I
believe. And we believe with

530
00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:06.200
the seven properties that we
can secure these devices and

531
00:27:06.200 --> 00:27:08.420
respond to any potential tax
as well. It gives us

532
00:27:08.420 --> 00:27:10.340
the idea to say like,
right, we're not naive. We

533
00:27:10.340 --> 00:27:13.580
don't think this will prevent
every single problem in the

534
00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:15.740
future because it's a cat
and mouse game with security.

535
00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:17.630
Right. But it does give
us defense and depth and

536
00:27:17.630 --> 00:27:20.930
compartmentalization and certificate based authentication
and all of these properties

537
00:27:20.930 --> 00:27:23.210
give us the ability to
go in and fix or

538
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:26.540
update these systems. Yeah. Yeah.
And it also, one of

539
00:27:26.540 --> 00:27:28.400
the things that was interesting
was the idea of failure

540
00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:31.550
reporting that in order to
be secure, a device needs

541
00:27:31.550 --> 00:27:33.680
to be able to talk
to a failure analysis system,

542
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:38.060
you know, in a timely
manner. Yeah. And so I

543
00:27:38.060 --> 00:27:42.140
think Bailey reporting is really
interesting from the perspective of

544
00:27:42.140 --> 00:27:44.600
us trying to prevent things
in the future and to

545
00:27:44.780 --> 00:27:47.810
detect, detect potential attacks, I
guess, before they happen, it's

546
00:27:47.810 --> 00:27:49.940
a little minority report. Ish,
if you think about it,

547
00:27:49.940 --> 00:27:53.420
but it's a cool idea.
That's an interesting, that's an

548
00:27:53.420 --> 00:27:55.640
interesting point. You can say
that this looks suspicious, right?

549
00:27:55.640 --> 00:27:58.220
It's just like when, when
I was working on banking,

550
00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:01.250
we would have varying levels
of suspicion around something like,

551
00:28:01.790 --> 00:28:04.400
Oh, you logged in, okay,
well it's you? Same IP,

552
00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.860
same browser. It's probably fine.
We'll just ask for your

553
00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:09.560
password. Hey, look, now you're
in, you know, you're in

554
00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:12.770
Russia on a wifi, in
a strange hotel with a

555
00:28:12.770 --> 00:28:15.440
new browser, right. This all
added up to varying levels.

556
00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:17.030
And then what we're going
to double challenge or triple

557
00:28:17.030 --> 00:28:20.480
J now you're moving money,
you know, varying levels of

558
00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:22.730
trust. And you can think
about this for developers who

559
00:28:22.850 --> 00:28:25.940
run services. This is sort
of like observability and metrics

560
00:28:25.940 --> 00:28:29.000
of what these devices are
doing, right? Like just like

561
00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:30.650
you would look at a
server and see like, are

562
00:28:30.650 --> 00:28:33.170
you seeing a bunch of
crashes? Something's probably wrong with

563
00:28:33.170 --> 00:28:36.740
the software or about to
go wrong, right? Or like

564
00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:38.810
the calls are becoming more
latent. Like this just gives

565
00:28:38.810 --> 00:28:41.960
us visibility into what's actually
happening in these devices in

566
00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:46.010
the world where a system
that didn't have failure reporting

567
00:28:46.010 --> 00:28:49.310
would have no visibility into
what's going on. Is his

568
00:28:49.310 --> 00:28:52.190
update ability. One of the
things that's part of this,

569
00:28:52.190 --> 00:28:55.490
because I don't want to
have my, my nontechnical spouse

570
00:28:55.490 --> 00:28:59.540
flash the firmware on the
fridge. It's not really. Yes.

571
00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:02.180
So one of the properties
that the cloud services provides

572
00:29:02.180 --> 00:29:05.660
renewable security is for, you
know, for 10 years of

573
00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:08.960
these devices, we will commit
to updating the operating system

574
00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.450
and shipping regular updates. And
you don't have to think

575
00:29:11.450 --> 00:29:13.910
about it. It just, you
know, our operating system does

576
00:29:13.910 --> 00:29:16.580
this for you. And then
the device manufacturers can also

577
00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:19.370
ship their own updates, whether
those be security patches, or

578
00:29:19.550 --> 00:29:21.710
for instance, lighting up a
new feature that they want

579
00:29:21.710 --> 00:29:24.410
to give you access to.
I see. And then does

580
00:29:24.410 --> 00:29:27.590
this all plug into the
Azure IOT stuff that like,

581
00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:30.980
I already know how to
do? Yeah. So the, you

582
00:29:30.980 --> 00:29:33.440
can use this easily with
Azure IOT, you would take

583
00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.650
that certificate that the security
services issued you and use

584
00:29:36.650 --> 00:29:38.900
that to authenticate to your
Azure IOT hubs so that

585
00:29:38.900 --> 00:29:42.670
you could process the telemetry
you're already. And there's a

586
00:29:42.670 --> 00:29:46.810
whole connected devices set up.
That's very, very easy, you

587
00:29:46.810 --> 00:29:49.780
know, sort of like one,
two button clicks that are,

588
00:29:49.810 --> 00:29:52.920
that's a great experience. So
last question I want to

589
00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:55.740
ask you because I've always
wondered is everyone's talking about

590
00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:58.800
IOT edge, like the edge,
the intelligent edge, the edge.

591
00:29:58.800 --> 00:30:00.480
Do I have no idea
what any of that means?

592
00:30:01.170 --> 00:30:02.670
Why is it on the
edge? What ads are we

593
00:30:02.670 --> 00:30:06.150
on? So yeah, I mean,
so Azure IOT edge is

594
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:09.780
a super cool product. I
think this edge that we're

595
00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:12.420
talking about and, you know,
it was funny at RSA.

596
00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:16.770
Like a lot of folks
were confused about, about the

597
00:30:16.770 --> 00:30:18.630
Azure branding name. Cause really
this, if you can think

598
00:30:18.630 --> 00:30:21.570
about it, that the cloud
edge is expanding and maybe

599
00:30:21.570 --> 00:30:25.650
that gets a little like
philosophical, right. But if you

600
00:30:25.650 --> 00:30:28.530
think about it, we're, we're
putting like all the data

601
00:30:28.530 --> 00:30:30.870
processing and all the information
and knowledge used to be

602
00:30:30.870 --> 00:30:33.030
like in single data centers
in the cloud. Right. And

603
00:30:33.030 --> 00:30:35.460
now we're reaching out to
the edge and saying, you

604
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:37.770
know, there's compute running at
the edge and there are

605
00:30:37.770 --> 00:30:40.140
these devices that are collecting
and reporting data at the

606
00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:42.990
edge. And those are really
part of the whole cloud

607
00:30:43.050 --> 00:30:46.770
ecosystem. I see. So if
I've got a thermostat, I

608
00:30:46.770 --> 00:30:49.320
can centralize all of the
information or I can think,

609
00:30:49.320 --> 00:30:50.970
well, this is a much
more powerful device than it

610
00:30:50.970 --> 00:30:52.860
used to be extra little
database of its own. It

611
00:30:52.860 --> 00:30:54.930
can hang on to the
data and I'll go and

612
00:30:54.930 --> 00:30:59.190
get it from the edge.
Okay. That was the date.

613
00:30:59.220 --> 00:31:00.750
I was just trying to
figure out like a, you

614
00:31:00.750 --> 00:31:02.670
know, I've seen ready player
one, and I just want

615
00:31:02.670 --> 00:31:04.380
to understand where the edge
is and how far we're

616
00:31:04.380 --> 00:31:07.380
going to push it. I
think it's an always moving

617
00:31:07.380 --> 00:31:09.900
boundary. Yeah. It's like, do
you want me to draw

618
00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.240
a line on your house
where the edges would be

619
00:31:12.240 --> 00:31:15.480
great? Yeah. Like do a
little like purple pen marker.

620
00:31:15.610 --> 00:31:19.230
Here's the edge. Here's the
glove. So if people are

621
00:31:19.230 --> 00:31:22.740
listening, if listeners for the
podcast are like into this,

622
00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:24.810
what do they do? I
mean, I'm looking here, where's

623
00:31:24.810 --> 00:31:27.120
the sign up now? Or
do they have to call

624
00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:29.700
someone to learn about this
if they, if it's perfect

625
00:31:29.700 --> 00:31:33.090
for what they're working on?
Yeah. So we basically announced

626
00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:37.230
at RSA that we are
in private preview. And so

627
00:31:37.230 --> 00:31:40.180
I believe if you go
to the websites, there's a

628
00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:42.540
way to contact us. Or
you can always email Azure

629
00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:49.200
sphere@microsoft.com if you're interested. And
then we've talked about being

630
00:31:49.200 --> 00:31:52.500
more, being in a public
preview sometime later this year.

631
00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:57.120
And then the first devices
that, you know, a device

632
00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:00.600
manufacturer will produce containing an
Azure sphere. Certified chip is

633
00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.550
targeted to be on shelves
by the end of the

634
00:32:02.550 --> 00:32:05.790
year. Very cool. This is
great. Thanks so much for

635
00:32:06.150 --> 00:32:08.490
explaining this to me. Awesome.
Thanks for having me, Scott.

636
00:32:09.030 --> 00:32:12.000
All right. This has been
another episode of Hanselminutes and

637
00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.380
we'll see you again next
week.
