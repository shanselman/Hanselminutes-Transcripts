Hey friends, we have a
new sponsor today, and I

2
00:00:02.280 --> 00:00:04.470
want to make sure that
you support them because they

3
00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.390
make Hansel minutes possible. Raven
DB, it's a document database

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:13.890
that's non-relational and fully transactional.
It's available for windows and

5
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.690
Linux with official client API
APIs for.net. The JVM go

6
00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.530
Ruby, no JS and Python.
Raven DB is designed for

7
00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:26.130
high performance handling tens of
thousands of requests, even on

8
00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:29.430
a single node. Now, Raven
DB is capable of on

9
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:33.930
the fly optimization, dynamic indexes,
and much more. It has

10
00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:36.720
a fully loaded gooey, which
means it's simpler to operate

11
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:39.420
and you don't need, you
know, arcane incantations on the

12
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:42.090
command line. It just works.
It's fast and it's right.

it out. <inaudible> Hi, this

15
00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:08.840
is Scott Hanselman. This is
Hansel minutes. And today I'm

16
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:12.500
talking with Charles Petzold. How
are you, sir? Good, good.

17
00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.620
You know, I taught a
number of your books. I

18
00:01:15.620 --> 00:01:17.660
was taught by your books
and taught one of your

19
00:01:17.660 --> 00:01:22.280
books in school. Particularly my
favorite book was a code

20
00:01:22.430 --> 00:01:25.160
that you wrote. I love
that book. Oh, thank you.

21
00:01:25.190 --> 00:01:27.500
Thank you. It's such a
joy, the hidden language of

22
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.150
computer hardware and software. And
I understand that you're working

23
00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:34.040
on a new book and
who knows how long it'll

24
00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:38.000
take you to finish it.
The new book is I've

25
00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:40.640
been working on it off
and on for 15 years.

26
00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:46.070
So I it's. And as
I've been thinking about it

27
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:49.100
and putting it off, it's
gotten more complex. I've created

28
00:01:49.100 --> 00:01:52.940
a lot more reference material
for it. And so each,

29
00:01:52.970 --> 00:01:56.420
each chapter is like a
couple of books, shelves full

30
00:01:56.420 --> 00:02:01.100
of, of, of reference material.
It's just an enormous task

31
00:02:01.310 --> 00:02:04.010
that I've set up for
myself when you're putting together

32
00:02:04.010 --> 00:02:07.040
a book that explores like,
you know, historical foundations of

33
00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:10.340
computing, the cultural context of
computing, how do you make

34
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.670
sure you don't accidentally write
like 10,000 pages and take

35
00:02:13.670 --> 00:02:18.230
over a shelf? That's it's,
it's hard. I have this

36
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.440
particular book plotted out pretty
well. And I head, and

37
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:23.870
I know what there's going
to be 10 or 11

38
00:02:23.870 --> 00:02:26.690
chapters, and I know what
each chapter has to cover,

39
00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:30.650
but I'm gonna have really
have to restrain myself to

40
00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:36.230
keep the, the individual chapters
to about maybe 35 pages

41
00:02:36.230 --> 00:02:39.110
a piece. So the book
comes in at about 350

42
00:02:39.110 --> 00:02:43.760
pages on the other hand,
there's I don't think this

43
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:48.350
particular book is going to
appeal to a whole lot

44
00:02:48.350 --> 00:02:50.600
of people. So in one
sense, I'm writing it for

45
00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.410
myself. And so I'm thinking
I can just make the

46
00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:56.240
chapters as long as I
want. And it book comes

47
00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:01.480
in at a thousand pages.
I care. So I don't

48
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:04.510
know. We'll see, we'll see.
It's, it's a work in

49
00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:07.920
progress. Do you write books
for yourself or do you

50
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:10.320
write them for, for our
mass audience? I mean, I

51
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.470
read code almost 20 years
ago and now 18 years

52
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.500
ago. And I think of
it as being a book

53
00:03:16.530 --> 00:03:19.590
that's, it's kind of like
the missing Tetris piece from

54
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:22.380
my computer science education. Like
it's that piece that they

55
00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.340
didn't teach me in school.
Yeah. Yeah. I certainly wrote

56
00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:30.270
that for an audience. The
audience that I had in

57
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:37.350
mind were our parents, many
of my contemporaries who worked

58
00:03:37.350 --> 00:03:41.040
in the computer industry complained
that their, that their parents

59
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:43.620
didn't know what they did
for a living and they

60
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.650
would try to explain it.
And, and of course the

61
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:52.530
parents would, would go glassy-eyed
and well, as for younger

62
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:55.230
people now, their parents actually
do know a lot more

63
00:03:55.230 --> 00:03:58.980
about computers, but for my
generation, they did not. So

64
00:03:59.190 --> 00:04:02.760
I thought of it as
a book for our parents

65
00:04:02.910 --> 00:04:06.390
to show them what digital
technologies were all about. And

66
00:04:06.390 --> 00:04:10.410
then I had these crazy
ideas that maybe like actual

67
00:04:10.410 --> 00:04:15.840
politicians might read it to
understand the, the computer revolution.

68
00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:19.530
I don't think that came
about, but, but I did

69
00:04:19.530 --> 00:04:21.660
have, I did have an
audience in mind. I always

70
00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:24.840
have an audience in mind.
How would you Important is

71
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:29.460
it for like new people?
I talk about bootcamps and

72
00:04:29.460 --> 00:04:34.680
self-taught learners and nontraditional learners.
And even now computer scientists

73
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:38.370
that have degrees, degreed, computer
scientists, and software engineers come

74
00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:42.930
out without understanding the historical
foundations of computers before I

75
00:04:42.930 --> 00:04:46.530
dunno, 1940. And without understanding
the context within which these

76
00:04:46.530 --> 00:04:51.330
computers sit, Yeah, it's hard
to know how much this

77
00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:56.640
affects their perspective. What I
was became disturbed about was

78
00:04:56.640 --> 00:05:01.170
people were, were people who,
who seem to be very

79
00:05:01.170 --> 00:05:05.640
fluent in, in high level
languages, but had no idea

80
00:05:05.640 --> 00:05:09.030
what was going on underneath,
at least in, in C

81
00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:12.120
plus plus and C we
had pointers. And so to

82
00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.850
use a point here, you
had to really know the

83
00:05:14.850 --> 00:05:18.480
architecture of the underlying computer,
but once, once computer languages

84
00:05:18.510 --> 00:05:22.770
pretty much abandoned pointers as
M C sharp does, to

85
00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:25.320
a large extent, even though
you can use point gears

86
00:05:25.320 --> 00:05:28.440
when C sharp, it seemed
as if, if the programmers

87
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:31.590
didn't really know that stuff.
So I hear from a

88
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:35.280
lot of people who have
been programming for years and

89
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.610
sometimes decades who say, Oh,
I read code. And now

90
00:05:38.610 --> 00:05:42.540
I finally understand how computers
work. And that's, that's really

91
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:45.750
gratifying. Talk about how we
stand on the shoulders of

92
00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:48.600
giants. And, you know, we
think about each additional layer

93
00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.230
of abstraction is indistinguishable from
magic, but at what point

94
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:54.240
do you need to understand
those layers of abstraction? Like

95
00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:56.820
you wrote another book called
the annotated touring where you

96
00:05:56.820 --> 00:06:01.430
guide through Alan Turing's paper
on computability, but does a

97
00:06:01.430 --> 00:06:03.530
JavaScript programmer need to know
that? Or maybe they just

98
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:05.960
want to know it if
they want to understand the

99
00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.090
why, but it doesn't really
make their job any easier.

100
00:06:08.410 --> 00:06:11.470
Yeah. I got those questions
a lot with annotated touring.

101
00:06:11.480 --> 00:06:15.520
How does this help the,
the average programmer? And I

102
00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:20.800
really have to say not
much, except that there is

103
00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.950
this common presumption and it's
even in, in the movie

104
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:27.040
about touring, the title of
which escapes me at the

105
00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.920
moment, the imitation game, where
someone describes Turing's paper as

106
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:35.740
showing that any problem can
be solved by a computer.

107
00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:39.430
And that's exactly what Turing's
paper does not show Turing's

108
00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:42.460
papers, shows the opposite of
that, that there are problems

109
00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:46.510
in, in mathematical logic that
cannot be solved by a

110
00:06:46.510 --> 00:06:50.530
computer in particular. The big
one is the really big

111
00:06:50.530 --> 00:06:54.310
one is that you can't
write a computer program that

112
00:06:54.310 --> 00:06:58.900
will debug other computer programs.
You can get close as,

113
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.050
as the, the people in
Microsoft research have done, but

114
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:08.320
you can't guarantee that a
program is debugged entirely. That's

115
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:12.490
a scary thought that there
is no way to guarantee

116
00:07:12.850 --> 00:07:18.580
that a program is entirely
debugged. And so that makes

117
00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.250
it, that should make us
a little humble. And it

118
00:07:21.250 --> 00:07:24.280
should, if somebody gets a,
a particular assignment from a

119
00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:27.970
boss that involves unsolvable problems
that they can say, you

120
00:07:27.970 --> 00:07:33.790
know, computers can't do everything
including this problem. Where did

121
00:07:33.790 --> 00:07:38.230
touring exist in the spectrum
of kind of mathematical computation,

122
00:07:38.530 --> 00:07:41.650
analog computers, digital computers. When
he was thinking about this

123
00:07:41.650 --> 00:07:44.470
in 1936, what was a
computer in his mind now

124
00:07:44.470 --> 00:07:47.380
that we've categorized them in
ours? That's hard to say

125
00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:51.500
he was really kind of
invented. It was really a,

126
00:07:51.500 --> 00:07:55.840
a intellectual tool, a tool
of the mind that a

127
00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:02.740
machine that would do something
very methodically involving numbers and

128
00:08:02.740 --> 00:08:06.700
would, would read symbols off
of paper tape and write

129
00:08:06.700 --> 00:08:10.210
symbols back on the paper
tape. And so he was

130
00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:15.490
really more of trying to
formalize what an algorithm is,

131
00:08:16.540 --> 00:08:20.110
where there's no intuition. It's
just a matter of, of

132
00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:24.460
recipe steps. So touring no
new of no working computers

133
00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.340
around the same time. There
were a couple people putting

134
00:08:27.340 --> 00:08:31.180
together what later became digital
computers, but touring did not

135
00:08:31.180 --> 00:08:36.070
know about them. He knew
about Charles Babbage. So the

136
00:08:36.070 --> 00:08:38.620
idea, and a lot of
people knew about Charles Babbage.

137
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:43.480
And so the idea of
that a machine could be

138
00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:49.390
doing calculations. Wasn't entirely fanciful.
From what I could understand,

139
00:08:49.390 --> 00:08:53.860
I don't think touring knew
anything about analog computing, which

140
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:58.650
had been around depending upon
how you define it. Analog

141
00:08:58.650 --> 00:09:03.420
computing could go back to
the slide rule. Maybe that's

142
00:09:03.420 --> 00:09:08.520
the 17th century, but the
analog computer is that interest

143
00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:12.210
to me. One is from
the 1870s. This is the

144
00:09:12.210 --> 00:09:15.600
subject of the book I'm
reworking on. This is a

145
00:09:15.810 --> 00:09:21.240
tied predicting machine invented by
Scottish, a physicist, William Thompson also

146
00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:24.930
known as Lord Kelvin. The
other big one is Vandever

147
00:09:24.940 --> 00:09:30.960
bushes, a differential analyzer, which
he built in the 1920s

148
00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.860
at MIT. And that solves
differential equations. Both these machines

149
00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:39.210
I think are very clever
and that's why they, they

150
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:42.000
interest me. And, and yeah,
I don't like computing is

151
00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.590
really a forgotten chapter in
the history of computing. And

152
00:09:45.590 --> 00:09:48.690
when we say computer, we
mean digital computer and the

153
00:09:48.690 --> 00:09:53.670
history, likewise is, is all
digital. Even though there are

154
00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:58.140
people still alive who cut
their teeth on doing, working

155
00:09:58.140 --> 00:10:01.740
on analog computers. So it's,
it's not that distant in

156
00:10:01.740 --> 00:10:04.160
the past, Who sort of
puts us into kind of

157
00:10:04.230 --> 00:10:06.620
a little bit of historical
context for some of the

158
00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:08.510
names that we dropped for
people who are listening, who

159
00:10:08.510 --> 00:10:11.780
may not follow this. So
touring conceived of an imaginary

160
00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:16.820
computer in 1936 while Babbage
kind of invented the concept

161
00:10:16.820 --> 00:10:19.580
of a computer and was
active in the, in the

162
00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:26.930
1850s. So even 80 years,
90 years, previous Lord Kelvin

163
00:10:26.930 --> 00:10:30.800
built his tied predicting machine
in 1872. So you said

164
00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:34.910
in 2018 that analog computers
are a largely forgotten part

165
00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:40.520
of computing. Here. We have
touring in, in 1936, not

166
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:44.180
thinking about an analog computer
that was created almost a

167
00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:47.300
century previous. It was just,
it was a chapter that

168
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:49.190
wasn't even in his mind
while he was thinking about

169
00:10:49.190 --> 00:10:54.710
computing. Yeah. Primarily because he
was attacking problems in mathematical

170
00:10:54.710 --> 00:10:59.810
logic. Whereas the analog computers,
particularly like the differential analyzers

171
00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:03.830
solve differential equations, if he
was, if Turing was interested

172
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.120
in solving differential equations, he
would have probably learned about

173
00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:11.420
the differential analyzer, but that
wasn't what he was doing.

174
00:11:11.780 --> 00:11:14.750
So it's, it's really a,
it shows, it actually shows

175
00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.470
some of the divide, the
big Gulf between analog computing

176
00:11:18.470 --> 00:11:21.980
and digital computing that they're
used for two different jobs.

177
00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:27.830
So analog computers are computers
that use physical phenomenon, things

178
00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:30.590
that are mechanical, or maybe
hydraulic or electrical to solve

179
00:11:30.590 --> 00:11:33.650
a problem. There's this wonderful
picture that I'll, I'll try

180
00:11:33.650 --> 00:11:35.660
to put up on a,
on the show notes of

181
00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:38.450
this piece of hardware, of,
of wood and brass that

182
00:11:38.450 --> 00:11:42.260
is Lord Kelvin's machine. Maybe
you could talk about what

183
00:11:42.260 --> 00:11:44.360
that does. It doesn't look
like a computer, but it

184
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:49.280
computes In the 1860s, Lord
Kelvin, who was then known

185
00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:56.500
as William Thompson got interested in
the tides. And he developed

186
00:11:56.590 --> 00:12:01.690
a new process for analyzing
the tides and predicting the

187
00:12:01.690 --> 00:12:05.670
tides. And what you do
is you stick a tide

188
00:12:05.670 --> 00:12:09.700
gauge at some Seaport, and
this measures how the tie,

189
00:12:09.730 --> 00:12:12.070
how the water is rise
and fall over the course

190
00:12:12.070 --> 00:12:15.010
of the day. And you
take a reading every hour,

191
00:12:15.160 --> 00:12:18.430
these tide gauges actually inscribed
the height at the tides

192
00:12:18.430 --> 00:12:21.190
on, on a roll of
paper, but you take like

193
00:12:21.190 --> 00:12:24.010
readings every hour for a
year or so, maybe a

194
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:27.250
couple years. And then you
apply for your analysis to

195
00:12:27.250 --> 00:12:31.450
it. And you break down
the, the erratic up and

196
00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:35.590
down of the tides into
sine curves. And the sine

197
00:12:35.590 --> 00:12:41.110
curves will have recognizable periods.
They'll have periods of 12

198
00:12:41.110 --> 00:12:44.320
hours, which is the effect
of the sun on the

199
00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:48.400
tides. They'll have periods of
12 hours, 25 minutes, which

200
00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:50.830
reflects the effect of the
moon on the tides. And

201
00:12:50.830 --> 00:12:54.670
they'll have other periods as
well for resonance factors and

202
00:12:54.670 --> 00:12:57.640
all. So you apply for
your analysis to it. You

203
00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:00.880
break down the pattern of
the ties into separate sign

204
00:13:00.880 --> 00:13:04.150
curves, say about 10 of
them. And then the tied

205
00:13:04.150 --> 00:13:10.750
predicting machine has separate wheels
for each of these sign

206
00:13:10.750 --> 00:13:14.470
curves. Each of these components,
they wheel employees, a mechanism

207
00:13:14.470 --> 00:13:19.450
called a scotch yolk, which,
which translates the revolution of

208
00:13:19.450 --> 00:13:21.850
the wheel to an up
and down movement. That is

209
00:13:21.850 --> 00:13:24.790
the sign and the co-sign
of, of the, the wheel

210
00:13:24.790 --> 00:13:30.580
angle. And by these wheels,
you can adjust a frequency

211
00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:32.920
and an with gears, you
can just the frequency of

212
00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.050
each of these wheels and,
and you can adjust the

213
00:13:35.080 --> 00:13:38.590
amplitude and where it starts
and in. So you have

214
00:13:38.590 --> 00:13:42.040
10 of these wheels bopping
up and down in sinusoidal

215
00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:45.400
patterns and you run a
cable around them to sum

216
00:13:45.400 --> 00:13:47.650
it all up. And that's
what you plot out on

217
00:13:47.650 --> 00:13:50.650
the paper and the tide
predicting machine. If you see

218
00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:53.500
the picture of it, when
you turn the crank, all

219
00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.710
these wheels, Bob, up and
down, and there's a pen

220
00:13:56.950 --> 00:13:59.560
that's hanging out the rise
and fall the tides into

221
00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:02.860
the future because the future
is based on the summation

222
00:14:03.130 --> 00:14:06.370
of the sign curves that
you derive from your historical

223
00:14:06.370 --> 00:14:10.540
data. The tide predicting machine
invented in the 1870s is

224
00:14:10.570 --> 00:14:16.240
doing a summation of 10
sine curves. And that to

225
00:14:16.240 --> 00:14:23.260
me is fairly sophisticated in
terms of analog, analog hardware,

226
00:14:23.740 --> 00:14:26.800
hardware. That doesn't seem to
be calculating in any way,

227
00:14:27.420 --> 00:14:30.900
Is this, as you turn
this crank, are you effectively,

228
00:14:30.900 --> 00:14:34.680
and forgive me if this
is an inappropriate dominion digitization

229
00:14:34.680 --> 00:14:37.590
of this, of this amazing
invention, is this basically a

230
00:14:37.590 --> 00:14:42.780
function wrap than a four
loop physically? Yes. Not really

231
00:14:42.780 --> 00:14:47.280
a forum. You see a
four loop is digital. Okay.

232
00:14:47.310 --> 00:14:52.370
Cause you're doing discrete numbers,
right? That's a good, That's

233
00:14:52.370 --> 00:14:57.610
a very, that's a very
important and insignificant difference. This

234
00:14:57.610 --> 00:15:00.930
is how our minds have
been so imbued with, with

235
00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:07.150
a digital concept. Forgive me
As you turn the crank,

236
00:15:07.390 --> 00:15:10.000
it is more like if
you think of, of the

237
00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.330
sine curves as, as mathematical
functions, it's increasing the value

238
00:15:13.330 --> 00:15:17.710
of T The time to
apply to the sine curves

239
00:15:18.170 --> 00:15:20.440
in Oak, and it's doing
it in a continuous fashion,

240
00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:25.000
It's doing it continuously. And
that's one of the things

241
00:15:25.420 --> 00:15:30.580
that is so interesting about
analog computers to me, because

242
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:33.940
I think about what it
takes to calculate a sine

243
00:15:33.940 --> 00:15:38.710
curve in, in a, in
a program, we, we set

244
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.960
up a four loop, right?
With, with our, with our

245
00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.800
angles, let's say zero to
360 degrees. And we pass

246
00:15:44.800 --> 00:15:46.990
those angles. We convert them
to radians and pass them

247
00:15:46.990 --> 00:15:51.280
to the, the.net map, that
sign function. Okay. Now what's

248
00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:55.330
the math ed sign function
doing well internally, it's, it's

249
00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:59.620
using the math coprocessor. That's
how that's in your machine.

250
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:04.660
And the math coprocessor to
calculate each value is doing

251
00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:08.920
a summation of, of a
bunch of terms involving factorials

252
00:16:09.070 --> 00:16:13.000
and exponents and all this.
It's really a lot of

253
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:16.420
number crunching that goes on
to get a single sign

254
00:16:16.420 --> 00:16:19.480
value and to flat out
a sign curve, you need

255
00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:21.910
a bunch of these and,
and, and tape them all

256
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:27.160
together. Whereas in an analog
computer, you're getting a signed

257
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.610
curve, continuous sine curve with
a fairly simple mechanism. Now

258
00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:38.170
some on curves are found
throughout nature. They are one

259
00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.160
of the fundamental rhythms of
the natural world. And the

260
00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:45.640
reason why is, is that
if you know, differential equations,

261
00:16:45.670 --> 00:16:50.140
anytime you have a differential
equation where a force is

262
00:16:50.170 --> 00:16:54.940
the inverse of displacement assigned
curve results like a spring.

263
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:58.360
If you stretch out a
spring, the more you stretch

264
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:00.550
it out to the more
force you need to stretch

265
00:17:00.550 --> 00:17:03.400
it out. As you compress
it, the further you compress

266
00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:05.530
it, the more force you
need to compress it. The

267
00:17:05.530 --> 00:17:08.620
fourth is the force that
you need to compress it.

268
00:17:08.620 --> 00:17:11.200
And the force that it's
exerting out is inverse to

269
00:17:11.200 --> 00:17:15.280
the displacement. So if you
stretch out that spring and

270
00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:18.610
let it go, it'll go
bouncing back and forth like

271
00:17:18.610 --> 00:17:23.200
a sine curve. Anything that
Lastic has as is tip

272
00:17:23.410 --> 00:17:28.150
Has this typical sign curve
a pattern. So that's why

273
00:17:28.150 --> 00:17:30.790
it's. So when you see,
when you start looking at

274
00:17:31.030 --> 00:17:36.940
analog computers, sign, getting signed
curves is fairly easy. Whereas

275
00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.300
in digital computers, the only
reason we think it's easy

276
00:17:40.300 --> 00:17:42.910
is because we have this
math that signed functioning, and

277
00:17:42.910 --> 00:17:47.200
it happens almost instantaneously, but
internally it's doing a lot

278
00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:52.920
of number crunching, which leads
me to, to think of

279
00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:57.630
analog computings as a more
natural representation of real world

280
00:17:57.630 --> 00:18:02.820
phenomenon and digital computers as
a Kluge, it has to

281
00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.470
approximate this real world process
with a lot of artificial

282
00:18:07.890 --> 00:18:11.330
calculations. Hey, friends just want
to take a moment to

283
00:18:11.330 --> 00:18:14.930
thank our sponsors because they
make Hansel minutes possible. I,

284
00:18:14.930 --> 00:18:17.510
you struggling to reproduce problems
in your code base. Well,

285
00:18:17.510 --> 00:18:23.060
successful software starts with Reagan.
Reagan provides application performance monitoring,

286
00:18:23.090 --> 00:18:27.050
unlike anything you've experienced before
it offers greater clarity around

287
00:18:27.050 --> 00:18:29.660
how your software is performing
for your customers. More than

288
00:18:29.660 --> 00:18:33.200
any other APM provider, I
use it myself. You can

289
00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:36.830
easily detect and diagnose issues
impacting end users. You can

290
00:18:36.830 --> 00:18:39.860
monitor every part of your
stack in one place. It's

291
00:18:39.860 --> 00:18:42.500
time to get back to
building great software instead of

292
00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:46.040
fighting it. Start your journey
to better software quality, try

R a Y G U

294
00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.910
n.com. Today. It's interesting if
you, if you think the

295
00:18:53.910 --> 00:18:56.060
direction that we're heading, where
we said, we were sitting

296
00:18:56.060 --> 00:18:59.210
on top of the shoulders
of giants, we're building all

297
00:18:59.210 --> 00:19:03.500
of these layers of abstraction
on digital foundations in order

298
00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:07.640
to simulate reality, which is
fundamentally an analog thing. And

299
00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:11.240
now, as we possibly hit
the edge of what digital

300
00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.330
computers can do, we consider
maybe quantum computers are the

301
00:19:14.330 --> 00:19:17.600
right way. Here we are.
Again, a quantum computer is

302
00:19:17.600 --> 00:19:19.670
almost a kind of analog
computer and that it is

303
00:19:19.670 --> 00:19:24.500
using the physical characteristics of
reality itself to think about

304
00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.190
reality. Yeah. On the other
hand, quantum computers use a

305
00:19:28.190 --> 00:19:34.490
process that Richard Fineman famously
pointed out. Nobody really understands.

306
00:19:37.210 --> 00:19:42.170
So that's scary to me.
It's it's we seem to

307
00:19:42.170 --> 00:19:46.940
be getting more and more
divorced from our, our common

308
00:19:46.940 --> 00:19:57.350
experience. There's, there's a lot
of, of analog devices and

309
00:19:57.380 --> 00:20:01.730
means of recording sound and
pictures. I'll give you an

310
00:20:01.730 --> 00:20:04.640
example. Before I get off
into abstractions, let me give

311
00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:10.040
you an example. I don't
know. I don't know your

312
00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:12.860
exact age, or if you
grew up with phonograph records,

313
00:20:13.730 --> 00:20:16.370
I did. But if the
groups in a photograph record,

314
00:20:16.370 --> 00:20:18.380
if you look at them
closely, if you apply a

315
00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:20.420
microscope to them, you'll see
that it's little bumps in

316
00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:25.310
there, and those are exactly
analogous to the wave forms

317
00:20:25.310 --> 00:20:29.570
of the air. Okay? So
you can see, Oh, the

318
00:20:29.570 --> 00:20:32.210
little needle is moving up
and down in the groove,

319
00:20:32.450 --> 00:20:35.870
and this is, is translated
to electrical pulse. And this

320
00:20:35.930 --> 00:20:39.590
electrical pulse is then translated
into a speaker vibrating back

321
00:20:39.590 --> 00:20:41.780
and forth. And we can
hear the sound. We're hearing

322
00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:45.830
an exact analog of little
bumps in the record groove.

323
00:20:46.280 --> 00:20:50.900
Whereas nowadays, what are we
hearing? We are hearing a

324
00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:56.590
wave form that is reconstituted
from a bunch of numbers.

325
00:20:57.550 --> 00:21:00.190
And I'm not saying, I'm
not saying this is, this

326
00:21:00.190 --> 00:21:03.550
is inferior. And I'm not
saying, I'm certainly not saying

327
00:21:03.550 --> 00:21:06.430
that we should start using
analog computers to replace digital

328
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:09.460
computers. Cause they're digital computers.
You know, they have this

329
00:21:09.490 --> 00:21:13.000
big advantage. They have this
major advantage that they're fast

330
00:21:13.030 --> 00:21:15.910
and they're extremely accurate and
they're cheap and they're tiny.

331
00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:19.060
And so it's, it doesn't
make any sense to do

332
00:21:19.060 --> 00:21:22.210
anything else. You know, I,
I listened to CD's and

333
00:21:22.210 --> 00:21:25.600
I listened to, to Spotify.
That's how I get my

334
00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:27.610
music. I'm not one of
these people who still have

335
00:21:27.610 --> 00:21:30.370
a turntable and, and, you
know, put my records on

336
00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:33.340
and put the needle down
on them. I I'm as

337
00:21:33.340 --> 00:21:37.690
immersed in this stuff as
anybody, but there's still something

338
00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:43.500
missing. We're getting more divorced
from the actual phenomenon. I

339
00:21:43.500 --> 00:21:46.260
wonder if at some point,
these abstractions are going to

340
00:21:46.260 --> 00:21:48.930
leak the amount of work.
It's the amount of work

341
00:21:48.930 --> 00:21:52.440
that's required for a digital
computer to do something to

342
00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.560
represent. Reality is a, is
a, is out of control.

343
00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:58.620
It's amazing. I just saw
that they're now releasing an

344
00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:03.210
Nvidia GPU that has the
strength to do Ray tracing.

345
00:22:03.540 --> 00:22:05.730
And I, I remember doing
Ray tracing, you would start

346
00:22:05.730 --> 00:22:07.740
the right trace and you
get a single frame, you

347
00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:10.860
know, the following the following
day, and now they're doing

348
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:15.120
120 frames, a second 4k
full rate tracing. But again,

349
00:22:15.480 --> 00:22:20.130
trying to represent how light
behaves and works using digital

350
00:22:20.130 --> 00:22:22.800
abstractions. So you're, you've been
working on this book for

351
00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.110
15 years and you maybe
have a few years to

352
00:22:25.110 --> 00:22:29.400
go, do you think this
warrants a whole book? We'll

353
00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:32.160
see, well, I started off
15 years ago and I

354
00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.620
thought, I knew how to
write this book. And I

355
00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.420
thought it was going to
be a mix of a

356
00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:40.950
little history and some physics
and math and all. And

357
00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:43.220
as, as I wrote a
couple of chapters and, and

358
00:22:43.740 --> 00:22:46.200
started doing, and you putting
the math in there and

359
00:22:46.500 --> 00:22:49.860
I was extremely unsatisfied with
it, it just didn't, it

360
00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:54.900
didn't flow. Right. And to
me, math is, is laziness

361
00:22:55.170 --> 00:22:57.480
in turn. And when you're
writing is I, if you,

362
00:22:57.480 --> 00:23:00.810
if you want to, you
put an equation into your

363
00:23:00.810 --> 00:23:06.300
pros and you, you, the
equation is very clear itself

364
00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.420
because it's math. There's no
ambiguity about it. But on

365
00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:11.520
the other hand, on the
other hand, a lot of

366
00:23:11.520 --> 00:23:15.600
people can't read that. And
so I got lazy doing

367
00:23:15.600 --> 00:23:19.650
that and, and I decided
eventually decided that the book

368
00:23:19.650 --> 00:23:22.740
would have no math in
it. And that I would

369
00:23:22.740 --> 00:23:25.140
need to explain a lot
of these things. And I

370
00:23:25.140 --> 00:23:28.020
would need to get to
a point where the reader

371
00:23:28.290 --> 00:23:34.080
intuitively understood why sine curves
are so prevalent in the

372
00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:37.200
natural world and get to
a point where they could

373
00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:41.970
see this machine and know
what it did. So that's

374
00:23:41.970 --> 00:23:44.430
going to be harder. I
also read one of the

375
00:23:44.430 --> 00:23:47.930
most books I read for
myself for my own writing

376
00:23:48.380 --> 00:23:51.290
is came out a few
years ago. The author is

377
00:23:51.290 --> 00:23:55.460
Richard Holmes, and the book's called
the age of wonder. And

378
00:23:55.460 --> 00:24:00.740
it's about science during the
late 17th century, late 18th

379
00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.520
century, early 19th century, what's
called the romantic age. And

380
00:24:04.520 --> 00:24:07.250
there's not, there's, there's no
mapping at all. There's no

381
00:24:07.250 --> 00:24:11.180
hard science in it, but
this guy covers the science

382
00:24:11.210 --> 00:24:15.890
in terms of literature and
poetry and art and politics

383
00:24:15.890 --> 00:24:20.750
and all that. It's all
connected. And I said, this

384
00:24:20.750 --> 00:24:24.470
is, this is what I
want to do. I want

385
00:24:24.470 --> 00:24:28.010
to have a good cultural
context for this stuff. So

386
00:24:28.310 --> 00:24:34.520
that's, that's, what's forcing me
to really do it really

387
00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:37.550
forcing me to, to not
be lazy, to really do

388
00:24:37.550 --> 00:24:40.610
a good job on this.
The other thing is that

389
00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:44.270
this machine and the reasons
why it was built, which

390
00:24:44.270 --> 00:24:48.980
is another inch, why Lord
Kelvin built this machine, why

391
00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.890
he got him interested in
the tides related, where it

392
00:24:51.890 --> 00:24:56.090
was related to his opposition
to Darwin's theory of evolution.

393
00:24:56.810 --> 00:25:00.230
That to me, that, that
this was part of the

394
00:25:00.230 --> 00:25:04.070
Darwin Wars. This machine, this
one of these early, an

395
00:25:04.070 --> 00:25:08.750
early computer makes the subject
very sexy to me because

396
00:25:08.750 --> 00:25:11.630
you're getting into a lot
of juicy stuff. So there's

397
00:25:11.630 --> 00:25:14.660
a lot of other pieces
of science that fall into

398
00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.300
it. There's the astronomy because
tides are based on the

399
00:25:17.300 --> 00:25:20.840
movement of the moon and
the sun and nears analysis

400
00:25:20.870 --> 00:25:23.990
during the French enlightenment of
vibrating strings. And here's the

401
00:25:23.990 --> 00:25:29.720
fourth part of it. And
then there's the geology because

402
00:25:29.780 --> 00:25:33.410
eventually Kelvin tried to figure
out the age of the

403
00:25:33.440 --> 00:25:36.950
earth. And he came up
with something like a hundred

404
00:25:36.950 --> 00:25:39.710
million years, and he didn't
think that was long enough

405
00:25:39.710 --> 00:25:43.880
for evolution to occur. So
there's a big geological component

406
00:25:43.970 --> 00:25:46.730
of, of, of this story.
So it's a lot of

407
00:25:46.730 --> 00:25:51.500
different pieces of scientific history
that come together in this

408
00:25:51.830 --> 00:25:55.820
one machine. And that is
just if it's, if it's

409
00:25:55.820 --> 00:25:57.410
going to take me the
rest of my life to

410
00:25:57.410 --> 00:26:03.010
write this book is so
be it. Well, let me

411
00:26:03.010 --> 00:26:04.600
ask you, let me ask
you this. As I have

412
00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.540
a 10 and 12 year
old entering middle school and

413
00:26:07.540 --> 00:26:11.110
soon high school, where would
they learn this? Where would

414
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:14.230
I fit a book like
this into their curriculum? If

415
00:26:14.230 --> 00:26:18.100
you've got geology and history
and technology and history of

416
00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:22.510
computing and the political and
socioeconomic context of the 16

417
00:26:22.510 --> 00:26:26.710
hundreds in the, where would
the dark, I mean, everybody

418
00:26:26.710 --> 00:26:30.580
has this sense that Darwin
was controversial at the time

419
00:26:30.580 --> 00:26:33.760
that that origin of species
was published. I mean, good

420
00:26:33.760 --> 00:26:37.960
Lord. It's it's in some
circles, it's still controversy. As

421
00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:41.410
we know, a lot of
this stuff, stuff is really

422
00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:46.470
academic books. The conflicts during
that period, I'm trying to

423
00:26:46.470 --> 00:26:52.140
make this book be as
popular as possible. I'm not

424
00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.130
putting any math into it.
That's a, that's a, that's,

425
00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.170
that's something. So I don't
know right now, I'm not

426
00:27:01.170 --> 00:27:03.690
sure what would be a
good book for young kids

427
00:27:03.690 --> 00:27:07.650
to learn the history of
science. Let me think about

428
00:27:07.650 --> 00:27:10.050
that. And I will, I
will let you know, cause

429
00:27:10.410 --> 00:27:13.620
your kids, your kids seem
so inquisitive and it's just

430
00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.040
great. It's every time you
post about your kids, it's

431
00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:22.680
like, ah, it's, it's often
hilarious, but they must be

432
00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:27.150
amazing. Well, hopefully will, if
they continue to, to absorb

433
00:27:27.180 --> 00:27:31.800
good information like this. And
I was fortunately able to

434
00:27:31.830 --> 00:27:34.890
read the first chapter of
your work in progress. And

435
00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:38.220
I must admit after gone,
going through five, six, seven,

436
00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:41.850
eight pages, I'm thinking to
myself here comes the equation.

437
00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:45.510
That's going to make me
feel not clever. And there

438
00:27:45.510 --> 00:27:48.810
you go. There's a triangle
with a circle, an arc

439
00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:51.420
being drawn in a pencil.
And I said, Oh, there's

440
00:27:51.430 --> 00:27:54.210
not accessible. And then I
got a couple more pages

441
00:27:54.210 --> 00:27:56.190
in and like, Oh, there's
a picture of the earth.

442
00:27:56.190 --> 00:27:59.010
And I must say, I
felt like I was reading

443
00:27:59.250 --> 00:28:01.830
something that was a smart
person book, but I didn't

444
00:28:01.830 --> 00:28:05.370
feel like I was being
expected to understand, you know,

445
00:28:05.370 --> 00:28:08.580
Latin symbols for summation. Good.
Which is a nice feeling.

446
00:28:08.580 --> 00:28:13.020
I appreciate that. So if
you're writing this book, are

447
00:28:13.020 --> 00:28:17.460
we just gonna follow you@charlespetzold.com
and then watch and learn

448
00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:20.190
as this comes to life?
We just wait until it

449
00:28:20.190 --> 00:28:23.670
comes out. Yeah. I, I
hope to post chapters. I'm

450
00:28:23.670 --> 00:28:27.750
not sure about posting every
chapter in progress. That may

451
00:28:27.750 --> 00:28:31.980
be a little anticlimactic when
the actual book comes out,

452
00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:34.590
if it does come out.
But yeah, I'm going to

453
00:28:34.590 --> 00:28:38.910
be posting more on Facebook
as, as the book develops

454
00:28:39.340 --> 00:28:44.790
on Facebook and my blog.
So yeah, Charles petzold.com. It's

455
00:28:44.790 --> 00:28:48.690
not a, I really need
to do a major upheaval

456
00:28:48.690 --> 00:28:51.780
on the website, but that'll
be coming as well. No

457
00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.900
worries. I really appreciate you
coming on the show and

458
00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:57.480
like the working title is
computer of the tides. And

459
00:28:57.480 --> 00:28:59.550
I just have to say,
I love that title. I

460
00:28:59.550 --> 00:29:01.800
think that's just a wonderful
title for this book. Cool.

461
00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:03.750
Thank you. Well, thanks so
much for talking with me

462
00:29:03.750 --> 00:29:06.960
today about all these things.
I'm going to include links

463
00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.300
and show notes so that
you can go and explore

464
00:29:09.570 --> 00:29:12.510
analog computers and Babbage and
touring. And of course, go

465
00:29:12.510 --> 00:29:14.820
to Amazon and search for
Charles pencil to check out

466
00:29:15.450 --> 00:29:19.530
many years of great books,
all recommended so much. This

467
00:29:19.530 --> 00:29:22.500
has been another episode of
Hansel minutes, and we'll see

468
00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:43.400
you again next week. <inaudible>.
