about X and a, an
indie games for the Xbox

8
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.360
three 60. Hi, this is
Scott Hanselman, and this is

9
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:56.450
another episode of Hansel minutes
this week on handsome mints.

10
00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:58.310
We've got George <inaudible> who
is going to talk to

11
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:02.750
me about <inaudible> and independent
gaming. How are you, sir?

12
00:01:03.590 --> 00:01:06.650
No, pretty good. Thanks for
chatting with me about this,

13
00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:10.310
you know, within the, the.net
development space, you know, I

14
00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:14.060
feel like I'm a pretty
engaged community guy, and I

15
00:01:14.060 --> 00:01:18.710
know a lot about different
community things, but the world

16
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.250
of X and a and
gaming and managed code on

17
00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:26.150
the Xbox, is that just
a foreign thing to me?

18
00:01:26.390 --> 00:01:28.400
And I'm kind of a
little ashamed in the sense

19
00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.260
of, I try to be
plugged in as much as

20
00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:32.750
I can, but, you know,
he just can't know everything.

21
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:36.260
So I said, George is
a guy I know who

22
00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:38.600
will talk to me about
X and, and explain how

23
00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:41.960
it is. I can write
C-sharp and run it on

24
00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:47.570
my Xbox. So where do
I start? Will you start

25
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:51.170
by hitting the recently renamed
app hub forums. They used

26
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:53.750
to be the X and
eight forums, and there you

27
00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.670
can pretty much get everything
you need to download and

28
00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:59.330
get going. It's funny that
you haven't like touched on

29
00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.450
and yet being a.net guy.
Cause I, in my head,

30
00:02:02.450 --> 00:02:04.160
everyone wants to be a
game developer. So I find

31
00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.650
it surprising that like everybody
who knows.net just hasn't jumped

32
00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:10.250
on accident because really, if
you understand how to do.net

33
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:12.320
programming, it really is not
that much more difficult to

34
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.560
get robbed and running with
X and a once you

35
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:18.500
downloaded tools, you're in your
familiar environment of visual studio

36
00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:23.510
programming, and you're very familiar
with C-sharp and there's a

37
00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:26.090
few quirks you gotta kind
of learn about and understand

38
00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:29.150
about game development. I mean,
if you're a wind farm

39
00:02:29.150 --> 00:02:31.430
developer, a windows forms just
kind of sit there and

40
00:02:31.430 --> 00:02:33.680
wait for an event to
happen. When you're programming for

41
00:02:33.680 --> 00:02:36.110
a game, you basically have
things constantly happening cause you're

42
00:02:36.110 --> 00:02:39.140
running in a tight loop.
And so that, that, that

43
00:02:39.140 --> 00:02:43.430
takes some adjustment to get
used to like, but basically

44
00:02:43.790 --> 00:02:46.970
most.net developers should be immediately
familiar and ready to go

45
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.660
within an hour, I would
say. And when I go

46
00:02:50.660 --> 00:02:53.840
file new project, I'm doing
this inside of visual studio

47
00:02:53.840 --> 00:02:56.510
express or do I have
to buy anything? Like how

48
00:02:56.510 --> 00:02:58.970
much money am I actually
put out to get it

49
00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.790
and running? You actually don't
have to invest in anything.

50
00:03:01.010 --> 00:03:03.190
If you've got a PC
that run visual studio, you

51
00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:06.760
can use visual studio express,
the default installation actually installs

52
00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:10.120
express for you. If you
have the full blown visual

53
00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:11.680
studio, if you're one of
those lucky guys that actually

54
00:03:11.690 --> 00:03:14.530
has it already, you can
just add it on to

55
00:03:14.530 --> 00:03:18.070
that as well and work
in your familiar professional environment.

56
00:03:18.340 --> 00:03:20.760
But yeah, you can get
going with the express. There's

57
00:03:20.770 --> 00:03:22.810
no no purchase and you
can actually make games for

58
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.560
your PC for free as
well. Oh, okay. So this

59
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.030
is the thing that everyone
talks about with X and

60
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.850
a, if I understand correctly,
I can write games for

61
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:34.170
the Xbox, for the PC,
for the Zune HD and

62
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.210
for the phone, Correct? Although
Zune basically with XMA 4.0,

63
00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:45.780
the support for that was
dropped. Okay. So focus on

64
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:49.050
the phone, the X-Box and
the NPC. So if I

65
00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:51.270
go and I say file
new project, do I tell

66
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:53.670
it that I'm making a
game for all of them?

67
00:03:53.670 --> 00:03:56.400
Or is it a checkbox?
Because I suppose that make

68
00:03:56.410 --> 00:03:58.260
me, It's basically a template
you're picking. So you're going

69
00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:00.270
to pick a, I'm going
to make an, an X

70
00:04:00.270 --> 00:04:03.600
and a PC game, a
annex and a Xbox game,

71
00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:06.720
or next night windows phone,
seven game. Now, one of

72
00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:08.100
the cool things they've got
about that is once you've

73
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:10.800
got started in one of
those projects, you actually can

74
00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:13.320
just right. Click and convert
the project to one of

75
00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:15.570
the other types as well.
So they've got a lot

76
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.670
of like little neat, nifty,
little tricks like that, where

77
00:04:17.840 --> 00:04:19.620
you can start on the
VC and be like, Oh,

78
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.120
I want to make this
for the three 60 and

79
00:04:21.150 --> 00:04:24.030
you know, target both platforms.
And you can pretty much

80
00:04:24.030 --> 00:04:26.790
just right. Click on your
solution and say, make a

81
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:30.990
X-Box three 60 project. And
it just does it. I

82
00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:33.900
can understand how that'd be
possible on the PC and

83
00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.810
the Xbox. I mean, they're
there, they both have high

84
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:39.480
resolutions. And, but what kind
of things do I have

85
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.760
to consider that are different?
Like when you wrote your

86
00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:44.400
first game for kids, did
you say, all right, I'm

87
00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.500
going to be 10 ADP
or where do you, what

88
00:04:46.500 --> 00:04:48.360
are the, some of, kind
of the initial decisions that

89
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:50.550
you have to make? Yeah,
that's, that's one of the

90
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:51.480
first things you want to
do is you want to

91
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.640
figure out, you know, what
your resolutions are that's I

92
00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:56.880
mean, and then inputs, everything.
It changes pretty dramatically between,

93
00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.800
you know, the PC and
the Xbox cause your, you

94
00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.870
got your game pad, which
will work with, if they

95
00:05:00.870 --> 00:05:03.480
have a USB game pack
plugged in, you know, Xbox

96
00:05:03.690 --> 00:05:06.090
controller, but you're not really
going to be using the

97
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:08.850
keyboard on the Xbox. So
those are two of the

98
00:05:08.850 --> 00:05:12.060
things that basically adjust a
lot. And the same thing

99
00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:13.290
for the phone. I mean,
if you're, if you're talking

100
00:05:13.290 --> 00:05:15.900
to all three platforms, you
probably still could you reuse

101
00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:18.210
a lot of your code,
you know, your physics engines,

102
00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:21.450
et cetera, but you're still
gonna be changing like, you

103
00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:25.680
know, your resolution and your
input, but for the Xbox,

104
00:05:25.950 --> 00:05:28.290
ideally what you want to
target is 1280 by seven

105
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:31.950
20. So that's pretty much
what, what background size you're

106
00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:34.320
going for. And you want
to scale your images accordingly

107
00:05:34.320 --> 00:05:37.140
to that. And that's actually
a fairly decent resolution for

108
00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:40.140
the PC as well. Is
the Xbox not 10 ADP.

109
00:05:41.700 --> 00:05:45.840
It is, you can develop
true 10 ADP, the 1280

110
00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.000
by seven 20. What happens
with that? If you target

111
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.840
that particular resolution, the Xbox
will do all of its

112
00:05:51.840 --> 00:05:54.660
scaling automatically for you. So
if people are running at

113
00:05:54.660 --> 00:05:58.250
different resolutions, the Xbox can
handle that by default. And

114
00:05:58.250 --> 00:05:59.780
so a lot of developers
would just target that cause

115
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:03.340
it's an easy route to
go. Okay. And when I

116
00:06:03.640 --> 00:06:08.230
say file new Xbox game
and I hit <inaudible> and

117
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:13.540
I'm on my PC developing
what happens, There's one little

118
00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:14.890
step you have to do
before you hit at five.

119
00:06:15.850 --> 00:06:18.190
Basically you have to have
your X-Box and your PC

120
00:06:18.580 --> 00:06:20.830
talking to each other. Most
people do cause they've got,

121
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.750
you know, windows, media kind
of streaming across to their

122
00:06:22.750 --> 00:06:25.420
three 60. If they're on
the same network, usually, you

123
00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:27.010
know, it's pretty easy for
the PC to find the

124
00:06:27.010 --> 00:06:29.650
three 60. And then there's
a little tool on the

125
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.530
Xbox that you will download
basically from the marketplace called

126
00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:36.730
X and a connect. And
you will have that up

127
00:06:36.730 --> 00:06:40.300
and running on your Xbox
three 60. And that's kinda

128
00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:43.030
like a little it's at
certain weights for that communication

129
00:06:43.030 --> 00:06:45.050
to start from your PC.
And so when you hit

130
00:06:45.050 --> 00:06:46.780
at five, it will push
out and start talking to

131
00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.360
that tool and pushing the
files across. And then suddenly

132
00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:53.560
your wonderfully beautifully crafted game
is now running on your

133
00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:59.260
TV and your three 16,
Do I have to like

134
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.690
unlock it? Or it's just
a matter of once I

135
00:07:01.690 --> 00:07:03.700
have the X and a
connect. That's the, that is

136
00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:05.980
the handshake that is required
in order to make them

137
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:10.090
talk, Correct. That's all you
need. And basically it runs

138
00:07:10.090 --> 00:07:12.310
first. So anytime you wanna
start doing your development, you

139
00:07:12.310 --> 00:07:14.650
will launch that first on
your three 60 and it

140
00:07:14.650 --> 00:07:19.000
sits there waiting for the
computer to start talking and

141
00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:20.950
now to do the development,
like there is a cost

142
00:07:20.950 --> 00:07:23.350
involved, a there is a
a hundred dollars a year

143
00:07:24.430 --> 00:07:27.310
fee to do three 60
development. So that's not completely

144
00:07:27.310 --> 00:07:30.610
free. Okay. So when does
that, when is that required?

145
00:07:30.610 --> 00:07:31.900
Is that when I want
to upload it to the

146
00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:33.730
marketplace or is that when
I want to see them,

147
00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:37.180
That's immediately when you went
to start pushing your games

148
00:07:37.180 --> 00:07:38.770
across to your three 60.
So if you want to

149
00:07:38.770 --> 00:07:41.170
debug and test your games,
which is pretty much recommended

150
00:07:41.170 --> 00:07:43.330
before you release it to
the marketplace, you you've got

151
00:07:43.330 --> 00:07:46.900
to pay that fee. I
see. So it kind of

152
00:07:46.900 --> 00:07:50.200
gives you the right to
develop games in your three

153
00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:53.290
60. The neat thing about
it is it's, it's a

154
00:07:53.290 --> 00:07:57.130
99% discount from the traditional
cost of developing games on

155
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:01.210
your three 60. What do
you mean? Well, traditionally, if

156
00:08:01.210 --> 00:08:02.980
you want it to develop
industry three 60, you've got

157
00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:06.280
to buy an Xbox three
60 dev kit, and usually

158
00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:09.190
only studios can get those
and the rumored price for

159
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:13.720
those is $10,000. Oh man.
That's the rumored price. I

160
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.600
don't know. Is that true?
Do we know From the

161
00:08:16.600 --> 00:08:19.330
legal documents we've seen, there
was a court case, I

162
00:08:19.330 --> 00:08:21.850
don't know, several years ago.
And so some of the

163
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:24.640
price pricing has got released
in the court documents. So

164
00:08:25.150 --> 00:08:28.300
that is our, our estimated
price. We don't know if

165
00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:30.100
it's changed since then, but
like that's what most of

166
00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:33.550
us quote, So you pay
a hundred bucks and now

167
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.100
you're, you have a game
for kids. That's 80 points.

168
00:08:36.130 --> 00:08:38.980
What is 80 points? That's
like nine, 9 cents. Yeah. That

169
00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:42.190
translates to basically a dollar.
And how much, how much

170
00:08:42.190 --> 00:08:45.400
of that dollar do you
get? I get 70% of

171
00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:48.520
it. Cool. That sounds good.
Not too bad. That seems

172
00:08:48.520 --> 00:08:51.490
to be the standard thing.
Right? Whoever's hosting the app

173
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:55.860
store. It takes 30%, Correct?
Yeah. It's, it's a pretty

174
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:59.010
decent deal. I mean, we've
had several people in the

175
00:08:59.010 --> 00:09:02.340
community over the last few
years, basically able to quit

176
00:09:02.340 --> 00:09:05.370
their jobs and do game
development full time. I wouldn't

177
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:06.720
say there's been a flood
of people that have been

178
00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:08.760
able to do that, but
we definitely have our success

179
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:12.050
stories. How long has this
been around? I mean, I

180
00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.580
know that the iPhone app
store's been around for a

181
00:09:13.580 --> 00:09:14.840
long time, but how long
have we had an app

182
00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:18.680
store in the context of
Xbox For the Xbox? It's

183
00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.230
been two years X and
it has been around for

184
00:09:21.650 --> 00:09:25.340
just over four years. And
then initially it was just

185
00:09:25.340 --> 00:09:28.490
a PC development. And then
they did a little bit

186
00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:31.850
of zoom development. And then
you could develop for your

187
00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:35.090
Xbox three 60, but there
was no marketplace yet. And

188
00:09:35.090 --> 00:09:36.890
then that kind of took
some time to get shaped

189
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.100
up and happening. And then
the marketplace has been running

190
00:09:40.100 --> 00:09:43.400
for two years now. And
where does this show up

191
00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.800
on the Xbox? I mean,
for very, there are probably

192
00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.580
people who are listening, who
have downloaded game demos before,

193
00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.130
and they know where their
game library appears, but they

194
00:09:52.130 --> 00:09:55.100
may never have actually found
this section on their Xbox.

195
00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:57.890
Where do I go to
find independent games on my

196
00:09:57.920 --> 00:10:01.220
Xbox It's, it's actually in
the same place. So when

197
00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:03.410
you're going to go buy
an Xbox live arcade game,

198
00:10:03.680 --> 00:10:06.590
such as casual Crashers or
any of the bigger titles,

199
00:10:07.190 --> 00:10:10.760
it's just a few more
menu items up. So there's

200
00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:14.330
the Xbox live arcade games.
And then right above that

201
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:18.110
is the indie games. So
it's right next to the

202
00:10:18.170 --> 00:10:21.800
big boys in the marketplace.
Was it always called indie

203
00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:27.260
games? Initially the focus was
more community. So it was

204
00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:31.850
called Xbox live community games.
But a lot of people

205
00:10:31.850 --> 00:10:33.830
kind of felt that that
got confusing that maybe like

206
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.140
it was just hobbyists only
that were doing it, or

207
00:10:36.650 --> 00:10:39.380
maybe, you know, it was
like, we're about socializing and

208
00:10:39.380 --> 00:10:41.300
less about game development. So
there was kind of a

209
00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:44.690
push from the community to
get that name changed. And

210
00:10:44.690 --> 00:10:47.630
then Microsoft responded and changed
it to Xbox live indie

211
00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:52.250
games. That's actually a very
non-Microsoft name. I like that

212
00:10:52.250 --> 00:10:55.730
name that's way better than
Xbox live community games. Yeah.

213
00:10:56.060 --> 00:10:59.270
It's a very cool name.
So what's the difference. I

214
00:10:59.270 --> 00:11:00.740
did kind of like it
when it's community games cause

215
00:11:00.830 --> 00:11:02.810
I'm really about the community.
So that was kind of

216
00:11:02.810 --> 00:11:05.360
a good feeling too. So
the name change was better

217
00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:10.610
overall. So what is the
difference between Xbox live arcade

218
00:11:10.610 --> 00:11:13.160
games and indie games? Is
it just the difference in

219
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:16.220
how much you've paid? Like
why wouldn't everyone want to

220
00:11:16.220 --> 00:11:19.370
make their game an indie
game and pay less money?

221
00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.590
There's several reasons. So Xbox
live arcade games can charge

222
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:27.620
a higher price point. The
maximum price points that Xbox

223
00:11:27.620 --> 00:11:30.950
live indie games can charge
is 400 Microsoft points, which

224
00:11:30.950 --> 00:11:34.190
is about $5. So the
price ranges for Xbox live

225
00:11:34.190 --> 00:11:37.220
into games are $1, $3
and $5. So $5 is

226
00:11:37.220 --> 00:11:39.080
the most you can charge
for an Xbox live indie

227
00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:43.700
game. Now Xbox live arcade
games can, can charge $20

228
00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.420
and more for, for their
downloads. And then there's, there's

229
00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:51.080
a couple other limitations as
well, file size. The maximum

230
00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:55.150
size of the game. Xbox
arcade has a higher restriction,

231
00:11:55.150 --> 00:11:57.610
the next box live indie
games. And then there's some

232
00:11:57.610 --> 00:12:02.540
rather large restrictions such as
leaderboards and achievements, Xbox live

233
00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.800
indie games can't do leaderboards.
So there's nowhere to have

234
00:12:05.800 --> 00:12:09.190
a, you know, a global
high score and then Xbox

235
00:12:09.190 --> 00:12:12.580
live in the games can't
do achievements. So which is

236
00:12:12.580 --> 00:12:14.470
actually rather large with the
gaming crowd. And one of

237
00:12:14.470 --> 00:12:16.450
the reasons that a lot
of us feel that X-Box

238
00:12:16.450 --> 00:12:17.950
live in games don't sell
as well as they do

239
00:12:18.490 --> 00:12:21.190
is that most gamers really
like that achievement system. And

240
00:12:21.460 --> 00:12:22.960
when you buy an Xbox
live into game, it doesn't

241
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.000
attribute to your gamer score
to your achievements at all.

242
00:12:25.950 --> 00:12:29.130
I see in gamer score
leader boards and achievements sound

243
00:12:29.130 --> 00:12:32.490
like the kind of thing
that would make a good

244
00:12:32.490 --> 00:12:36.630
game become, you know, viral
as it were and really

245
00:12:36.630 --> 00:12:40.290
popular exactly. Is there an
example of an indie game

246
00:12:40.320 --> 00:12:44.490
that made the leap over
from Indy to arcade? We've

247
00:12:44.490 --> 00:12:46.950
never had a game that
started out on Xbox live

248
00:12:46.950 --> 00:12:49.530
indie games, make the transition,
but we've had people that

249
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:52.890
started out developing with X
and a purely that were

250
00:12:52.890 --> 00:12:55.710
kind of targeting Xbox live
indie games. But before they

251
00:12:55.710 --> 00:12:57.870
released, they were able to
go to Xbox live arcade.

252
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:01.830
We've had, I think four
examples of that so far,

253
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:05.820
typically it's, it's surrounds there's,
there's, what's become pretty much

254
00:13:05.820 --> 00:13:08.190
an annual contest, although they
they'd never said they're going

255
00:13:08.190 --> 00:13:11.220
to do it annually called
dream build, play that Microsoft

256
00:13:11.220 --> 00:13:14.940
hosts and the winner of
that has the Microsoft has

257
00:13:14.940 --> 00:13:18.060
the right to offer them
Xbox live arcade contract. And

258
00:13:18.090 --> 00:13:20.010
we've had winners over the
past few years that have,

259
00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.950
have won that and move
on textbox lab arcade. So

260
00:13:22.950 --> 00:13:25.410
their game is still developed
an X and a, but

261
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:28.950
they're outside of the indie
game section and they can

262
00:13:28.950 --> 00:13:31.440
charge the higher price points
and add it at achievements

263
00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.980
and have gamer score. And
they're, they're much bigger successes

264
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:39.840
in that arena. Are, is
there a way to tell

265
00:13:39.870 --> 00:13:41.250
if a game has written
an X and a, I

266
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:43.710
mean like could like splinter
cell be written an X

267
00:13:43.710 --> 00:13:45.420
and a, and I don't
know it, or is it

268
00:13:45.420 --> 00:13:49.080
only indie games? I haven't
had this completely confirmed, but

269
00:13:49.080 --> 00:13:51.300
the rumor is, is that
there are more games written

270
00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:54.990
in XMA than we realize.
I'm not sure why publishers

271
00:13:54.990 --> 00:13:56.700
don't want to talk about
that or game developers. I

272
00:13:56.700 --> 00:13:59.790
want to talk about that.
But we, we did find

273
00:13:59.790 --> 00:14:03.570
out that Lucas arts released
a game called lucidity and

274
00:14:03.870 --> 00:14:05.970
we believe it's written next
day, simply because when, when

275
00:14:05.970 --> 00:14:08.610
you download it off of
steam, it installs some exnayed

276
00:14:08.610 --> 00:14:12.120
DLLs. You can't tell that
on the Xbox obviously, but

277
00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:14.250
when you download PC versions
of their games, you can

278
00:14:14.250 --> 00:14:17.630
kind of get a hint
that way. So there are

279
00:14:17.640 --> 00:14:21.270
games that may be written
the next day. It's just

280
00:14:21.270 --> 00:14:24.660
not become widespread. I'm not
really sure what the political

281
00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:28.980
battle there is. And if
I'm going to write my

282
00:14:28.980 --> 00:14:32.070
game so that it works
on both windows and Xbox,

283
00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:36.540
is it literally like right
wrong, write once, run anywhere,

284
00:14:36.540 --> 00:14:39.900
or do I have to
build two separate versions of

285
00:14:39.900 --> 00:14:42.990
the executable and package it
up differently for windows and

286
00:14:42.990 --> 00:14:48.930
exploits? You can write once
you'll, you'll build it twice,

287
00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.010
but you can still work
out at one solution. And

288
00:14:52.100 --> 00:14:56.870
your source code is shared
between the two. There are

289
00:14:56.870 --> 00:14:59.090
some kind of like Getches
and caveats. You got to

290
00:14:59.090 --> 00:15:02.240
pay attention to the garbage
collection on the three 60

291
00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:04.130
is horrendous. So even though
you've got, you know, a

292
00:15:04.130 --> 00:15:08.240
quad core machine that you're
working with, the it's running

293
00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:11.960
the compact framework and its
version of garbage collection is

294
00:15:12.230 --> 00:15:14.960
just horrendous. And so you
definitely don't wanna like start

295
00:15:14.960 --> 00:15:17.390
working on your PC game
and be near completion and

296
00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:19.310
then suddenly get the idea,
Oh, I might want to

297
00:15:19.310 --> 00:15:21.410
turn this into a three
60 game. You definitely want

298
00:15:21.410 --> 00:15:23.210
to be working on them
in parallel and testing on

299
00:15:23.210 --> 00:15:25.640
both platforms at the same
time, because there will be

300
00:15:25.820 --> 00:15:27.590
times where you've got to
like make some adjustments and

301
00:15:27.590 --> 00:15:29.840
changes based on the performance
on one or the other.

302
00:15:30.310 --> 00:15:34.540
Hmm. When you say horrendous,
like, okay, I assume that's

303
00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:36.760
pretty bad. And the assumption
of course, is that the

304
00:15:36.790 --> 00:15:39.850
Xbox has like, you know,
I don't know, half a

305
00:15:39.850 --> 00:15:42.160
gig of Ram and a
slower processor from five years

306
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.760
ago, but like your kid's
game that I bought has

307
00:15:45.910 --> 00:15:47.440
a lot of stuff going
on. I mean, there's a

308
00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.630
bunch of objects getting created
on the screen. It's pretty

309
00:15:49.630 --> 00:15:53.530
frantic, right? Let's say that
you discover that garbage collection

310
00:15:53.530 --> 00:15:55.930
is a problem. What can
you as a programmer do

311
00:15:55.930 --> 00:16:00.010
to fix that? It, it's
kind of interesting. Cause I

312
00:16:00.010 --> 00:16:01.840
think Gainesville is one of
those things that probably has

313
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:04.660
taught me more as a
business coder than anything else,

314
00:16:05.110 --> 00:16:06.520
because I've actually used a
lot of these tricks and

315
00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:09.970
techniques from game development and
business coding now. But things

316
00:16:09.970 --> 00:16:13.270
like, you know, for each
loops, there's, there's a lot

317
00:16:13.270 --> 00:16:15.580
of like boxing and unboxing
that happens, which for game

318
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:18.070
development, I didn't even really
like examine boxing and unboxing

319
00:16:18.070 --> 00:16:21.730
a variables and understood, you
know, what's happening here, but

320
00:16:21.910 --> 00:16:23.320
it's those types of things.
So, you know, you might

321
00:16:23.320 --> 00:16:27.160
use, you know, a different
type of loop or create

322
00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:30.550
structure instead of classes in
certain cases. And then what's

323
00:16:30.550 --> 00:16:33.430
really interesting when you're starting
to streamline stuff and getting

324
00:16:33.430 --> 00:16:36.670
rid of garbage and watching
optimization is you actually start

325
00:16:36.670 --> 00:16:39.010
to like inline things rather
than like calling methods and

326
00:16:39.010 --> 00:16:40.600
creating methods. So you actually
start doing a lot of

327
00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.830
like bad programming practices in
order to optimize things Interesting.

328
00:16:45.970 --> 00:16:47.290
Those are the types of
tricks you're going to use

329
00:16:47.290 --> 00:16:49.660
to increase speed. But one
of the things we tell

330
00:16:49.660 --> 00:16:52.690
people is never pre optimize.
So you usually write your

331
00:16:52.690 --> 00:16:55.000
code as you would normally.
And then you only start

332
00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:57.520
optimizing what you've discovered a
problem. So you do a

333
00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.090
lot of testing and benchmarking
and before you start making

334
00:17:01.090 --> 00:17:05.290
your terrible, Hi, this is
Scott coming to you from

335
00:17:05.290 --> 00:17:08.530
another place in time. Are
you using agile practices to

336
00:17:08.530 --> 00:17:10.720
manage your software development? There's
lots of tools in the

337
00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:13.030
market that manage the steps
of a project, but most

338
00:17:13.030 --> 00:17:15.970
of them focus on individual
roles, get ready for a

339
00:17:15.970 --> 00:17:18.340
solution that caters for the
success of the whole team.

340
00:17:18.490 --> 00:17:22.240

supporting Hansel minutes on their
Facebook fan page, facebook.com/t L

353
00:18:06.540 --> 00:18:10.470
E R I K Keller.
We do appreciate it. There

354
00:18:10.470 --> 00:18:12.540
wouldn't be a Hansel minutes.
If there wasn't teller helping

355
00:18:12.540 --> 00:18:16.230
us, what is what's considered
a, and this, this is

356
00:18:16.230 --> 00:18:19.110
very subjective, but what's considered
like to be the crown

357
00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:23.730
jewel of the indie games.
Like what's the one game

358
00:18:23.730 --> 00:18:25.590
or two games where you
go, wow. I can't even

359
00:18:25.590 --> 00:18:28.380
believe that this was done
by a regular person and

360
00:18:28.380 --> 00:18:31.790
not a game studio. Hmm.
That one's hard for me

361
00:18:31.790 --> 00:18:33.170
to answer. Cause I think
I've kind of lost the

362
00:18:33.170 --> 00:18:36.050
luster of like looking at
studios and seeing them with

363
00:18:36.050 --> 00:18:39.440
something that we can't do
anymore. It's like once you've

364
00:18:39.440 --> 00:18:41.900
done game though. Wow. When
you're watching the game, you're

365
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:43.550
like, Oh, I know how
they did that. That makes

366
00:18:43.550 --> 00:18:46.740
sense. I could have done
that. I mean, we have

367
00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:48.920
our, our crown jewel of
the communities just because it's

368
00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:52.280
like the biggest runaway success
story, but I don't know

369
00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:54.390
that like looking at the
game and you're super impressed,

370
00:18:54.440 --> 00:18:56.720
like what X and they
can do. It's just probably

371
00:18:56.720 --> 00:19:00.050
the most fun game when
you've played in awhile. I

372
00:19:00.050 --> 00:19:02.330
made a game with zombies
in it is basically just

373
00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.490
a dual stick shooter where
you're destroying a bunch of

374
00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.970
zombies, but the whole experience
is just so incredibly well

375
00:19:07.970 --> 00:19:10.880
done. I mean, like from
like the music is hilarious

376
00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:13.790
and funny, it's a guy
singing a song and the,

377
00:19:13.790 --> 00:19:18.020
you know, the effects are
incredible and he's got the

378
00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:20.300
music time to the game
and they're strobe lights flashing

379
00:19:20.300 --> 00:19:23.510
and time to the music.
And, and it's like a,

380
00:19:23.780 --> 00:19:26.150
a game that it's only
13 minutes and 37 seconds

381
00:19:26.150 --> 00:19:28.610
long, which is also a
nice, fun, little geek joke

382
00:19:30.410 --> 00:19:33.770
and only a dollar, which
he mentioned about five times

383
00:19:33.770 --> 00:19:39.230
in the song. And I
think he's made over $200,000

384
00:19:39.230 --> 00:19:42.930
on that game now. Wow.
It's kind of our, our,

385
00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:45.380
our success story. And he's
one of the few guys

386
00:19:45.380 --> 00:19:48.650
that he wondering build, play
the first one and got

387
00:19:48.650 --> 00:19:52.700
his Xbox live arcade contracts
that he's actually got games

388
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:54.830
on Xbox live arcade as
well. So he can, he's

389
00:19:54.830 --> 00:19:56.780
probably our biggest success story.
So if I was going

390
00:19:56.780 --> 00:19:59.030
to say like, we have
a, an indie, crown Juul,

391
00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:04.310
skull studios, James Silva's, the
guy would be who I

392
00:20:04.310 --> 00:20:07.580
would say represents the, you
know, our crown jewel. Well,

393
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:09.550
it's interesting because if you
look at the screenshots for

394
00:20:09.750 --> 00:20:12.800
this thing, I made a
game with zombies in it.

395
00:20:13.280 --> 00:20:16.010
It's not, I mean, as,
from a screenshot perspective, it's

396
00:20:16.010 --> 00:20:20.090
like, okay, a child, a
child drew these, these zombies,

397
00:20:20.090 --> 00:20:23.060
you know, it looks very
kind of simple, which I

398
00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:24.680
think gets to your point
about, you know, it's, it's

399
00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.480
more about gameplay and style.
I mean, he's got a

400
00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.510
song and he's got music
and it's, it's synchronized. These

401
00:20:29.510 --> 00:20:32.780
things are really subtle. I
mean, it's not, yeah. Can't

402
00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:35.300
judge How all that ties
together that made it so

403
00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:39.380
fun. Is that available on
PC also? Do you know?

404
00:20:40.610 --> 00:20:42.770
No, he doesn't have it
available on PC it's it's

405
00:20:42.770 --> 00:20:46.340
a three 60 only currently.
No. Why would someone want,

406
00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:50.020
want only on the three
60? It seems like, again,

407
00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.300
speaking as a person who
has never made a game

408
00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:54.640
like this, I would want
my game to be available

409
00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:56.950
as many places as possible.
So if I've got all

410
00:20:56.950 --> 00:20:58.870
this kind of intellectual property
and I've done all this

411
00:20:58.870 --> 00:21:02.260
work, I would think, gosh,
now that I've got this

412
00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:04.600
game, I've made a couple
of hundred thousand dollars on,

413
00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:06.580
let's put it on a
phone and let's put it

414
00:21:06.580 --> 00:21:10.260
on the PC, Right? The
phone. I think a lot

415
00:21:10.260 --> 00:21:12.720
of people are gonna be
considering simply because Microsoft has

416
00:21:12.720 --> 00:21:15.630
built a marketplace around the
phone. There is no marketplace

417
00:21:15.630 --> 00:21:18.810
for the PC. And that's,
that's the number one reason

418
00:21:18.810 --> 00:21:22.380
why developers haven't moved over
into the PC realm, Forex.

419
00:21:22.380 --> 00:21:25.410
And I, at least there's,
there's a huge setup, cost

420
00:21:25.410 --> 00:21:28.470
that most home computers don't
have the X and a

421
00:21:28.620 --> 00:21:31.890
redistributable installed on them. So
the install package alone is

422
00:21:31.890 --> 00:21:33.420
kind of confusing and hard
for most people to get.

423
00:21:33.420 --> 00:21:37.590
Right. And then there's just
no central distribution center. So

424
00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.660
there's a lot of overhead
for developers trying to like

425
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:41.940
they could create, you know,
their own checkout store and

426
00:21:42.630 --> 00:21:44.370
host all that themselves. But
like that's a lot of

427
00:21:44.370 --> 00:21:47.550
extra work. Yeah. That's a
really good point. I mean,

428
00:21:47.610 --> 00:21:50.610
people kind of ask what,
what is so important about

429
00:21:50.610 --> 00:21:52.860
the app store, but I
mean, I just went to

430
00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.670
X-Box dot com. I clicked
on indie games in the

431
00:21:56.670 --> 00:22:00.570
marketplace and then I just
shorted by bestselling of all

432
00:22:00.570 --> 00:22:04.140
time. And then I can
see right there, there's my

433
00:22:04.140 --> 00:22:07.350
maybe gamer zombies in it.
And for me to have

434
00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:09.720
to go and find that
on the web and download

435
00:22:09.720 --> 00:22:10.860
it in one set up
and all that kind of

436
00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.940
stuff. And I didn't actually
realize this until, till recently

437
00:22:15.330 --> 00:22:19.350
that I can actually go
there on my PC now

438
00:22:19.380 --> 00:22:22.680
hit download, and then go
to my three 60 later

439
00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:26.040
and it'll be waiting for
me. Yup. Yeah. That's a

440
00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.140
great little feature too. Like
when you've got like some

441
00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:30.270
huge game that came out
recently that you're excited about

442
00:22:30.270 --> 00:22:31.860
and you can start in
the morning and just like

443
00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:33.480
start to download. And then
when you get home there,

444
00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:37.650
it is waiting for you
to play that's. That's fantastic.

445
00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:42.210
I noticed that the second
most popular game, or one

446
00:22:42.210 --> 00:22:46.140
of the most popular games
looks just initially looking at

447
00:22:46.140 --> 00:22:48.870
it looks like something I
would not want to play

448
00:22:49.050 --> 00:22:52.290
a baby maker extreme. This
looks like a South park

449
00:22:52.290 --> 00:22:55.800
episode and possibly The artwork
is a lot like South

450
00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.950
park. That's one of those
interesting ones. The gameplay is

451
00:23:01.950 --> 00:23:05.130
basically a physics type gameplay
where you're trying to get

452
00:23:05.130 --> 00:23:07.470
this baby. That's just been
birthed to bounce off as

453
00:23:07.470 --> 00:23:13.320
many objects as possible to
go the distance. So it's

454
00:23:13.450 --> 00:23:17.430
the title's eye catching. The
cover. Art is eye catching

455
00:23:17.490 --> 00:23:19.770
and the gameplay is actually
relatively fun and it's pretty

456
00:23:19.770 --> 00:23:22.170
well polished. I think the
guy was a genius for,

457
00:23:22.230 --> 00:23:24.390
you know, just striking that
Gore to people. Cause people

458
00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.970
go, maybe make it extreme.
What is that? And then

459
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.580
it already gets him a
download. Yeah, exactly. Just because

460
00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:30.900
we want to know what
it is And then he

461
00:23:30.900 --> 00:23:32.730
gets them in there because
like the gameplay is fun.

462
00:23:32.790 --> 00:23:36.030
So I downloaded it, expecting
it to be absolutely horrible,

463
00:23:36.030 --> 00:23:38.100
but it's really well polished.
It's actually a lot of

464
00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:44.100
fun. Interesting. Are there controls
from the Xbox perspective? Like

465
00:23:44.290 --> 00:23:47.060
if I don't know, major
Nelson or somebody in charge

466
00:23:47.060 --> 00:23:48.980
goes and says, hi, this
is offensive. We're not going

467
00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:52.700
to put that in the
marketplace. Do people get kicked

468
00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.640
out of the marketplace or
not allowed in for various

469
00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:59.030
reasons? Cause you always hear
about iPhone people who can't

470
00:23:59.030 --> 00:24:02.890
be in the marketplace for
some reason. So The, for

471
00:24:02.890 --> 00:24:05.530
the Xbox three 60 and
the Xbox live indie game

472
00:24:05.530 --> 00:24:09.490
marketplace, it's a peer review
system, which means that everyone

473
00:24:09.490 --> 00:24:12.460
else like myself, who released
kids games on the systems,

474
00:24:12.460 --> 00:24:15.310
we review other people that
are trying to submit games

475
00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:18.220
and we kind of review
them for technical defaults and

476
00:24:18.250 --> 00:24:20.890
anything that's kind of inappropriate
for Xbox live. And there's,

477
00:24:20.890 --> 00:24:22.780
there's a very like strict
list of things that can

478
00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:24.910
and cannot be things that
are kind of on the

479
00:24:24.910 --> 00:24:27.160
fence or that the community
can agree. One, you might

480
00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.110
get some reviewers for like,
no, this is fine. I

481
00:24:29.110 --> 00:24:31.450
don't see this as being
offensive. They may pass it

482
00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:33.730
and then it can move
on to the marketplace. And

483
00:24:33.730 --> 00:24:35.830
at that point, the option
is, is that people can

484
00:24:35.830 --> 00:24:37.600
record it for reviews and
it might get cool then

485
00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:40.660
later. So Microsoft kind of
stays out of the entire

486
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.610
process. Microsoft actually is even
allowed to look in the

487
00:24:42.610 --> 00:24:45.940
review or play test threads
at all. So they really

488
00:24:45.940 --> 00:24:48.280
only see the games once
they've hit the marketplace. So

489
00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.750
it's really up to the
community to kind of police

490
00:24:49.750 --> 00:24:52.960
that and kind of set
the set the standard. That's

491
00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.690
impressive. I mean, as a
concept, I didn't realize that.

492
00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.300
So you, you personally can
vote on this with the

493
00:24:58.300 --> 00:25:01.780
community and say, this is
good or bad. Correct. And

494
00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:03.550
it's not so much good
or bad cause we try

495
00:25:03.550 --> 00:25:07.120
to take this subjectiveness out
of it. So if I

496
00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:09.310
see somebody's game and I'm
like, this is absolutely horrendous,

497
00:25:09.340 --> 00:25:11.440
you know, it looks like
a kid drew everything in

498
00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:13.030
here and actually it could
have been a kid who

499
00:25:13.030 --> 00:25:15.280
drew everything in there. I
can't actually like comment on

500
00:25:15.280 --> 00:25:17.230
like whether the game is
good or bad. I can

501
00:25:17.230 --> 00:25:19.930
only comment on whether it
has offensive material or it

502
00:25:19.930 --> 00:25:22.540
crashes. So we try to
make things like more black

503
00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:26.560
and white rather than subjective.
Okay. One thing I noticed

504
00:25:26.740 --> 00:25:29.920
in looking at the top
30 games, a bunch of

505
00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:33.550
them start with the term
avatar, avatar, paintball, avatar, drop

506
00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:37.090
avatar, golf, avatar, Showtime show
down that can't be a

507
00:25:37.090 --> 00:25:43.960
coincidence. There's at least 10
avatar games in. So the

508
00:25:43.990 --> 00:25:47.650
Xbox live indie game community
supports all types of developers.

509
00:25:47.830 --> 00:25:50.170
Some people are in it
because it's something that they're

510
00:25:50.170 --> 00:25:52.000
passionate about. It's a dream.
They're, you know, they're working

511
00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.610
on their dream game. Some
people are just like the

512
00:25:54.610 --> 00:25:56.320
novelty of it. You know,
there are some high school

513
00:25:56.320 --> 00:25:57.970
kids they're putting it together,
you know, and they think

514
00:25:57.970 --> 00:26:01.450
it's a great game. Some
people are really going on

515
00:26:01.450 --> 00:26:03.850
about this as a business
and other people are playing

516
00:26:03.850 --> 00:26:06.520
to what the community, what
the consumer seems to want.

517
00:26:07.210 --> 00:26:09.790
And avatar games are selling
right now. So they spend,

518
00:26:09.790 --> 00:26:12.100
you know, a couple of
weeks throwing together some new

519
00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:13.870
type of avatar game and
they push it out to

520
00:26:13.870 --> 00:26:16.240
the marketplace and they seem
to be selling. I mean,

521
00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:19.150
they, they stay fairly high
in the top downloads list.

522
00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:22.090
And so if people are
buying them, people are gonna

523
00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:26.800
make them. Well, definitely seems
like some of these avatar

524
00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:29.800
games are actually very, very
well rated. I mean, I

525
00:26:29.800 --> 00:26:32.830
look at just because something's
in the top, it doesn't

526
00:26:32.830 --> 00:26:34.150
mean that I'm going to
download it, but then I'll

527
00:26:34.150 --> 00:26:36.910
see that, well, this has,
you know, for like avatar

528
00:26:36.910 --> 00:26:39.310
Ninja has four stars and
then you looked at the

529
00:26:39.310 --> 00:26:41.890
screenshots and you say, Oh,
this actually looks like someone

530
00:26:41.890 --> 00:26:45.710
put a little bit of
work into it. Yeah. Yup.

531
00:26:46.070 --> 00:26:47.840
It kind of varies. It's
one of the, actually the

532
00:26:48.800 --> 00:26:50.510
kind of like points of
discussion we're having in the

533
00:26:50.510 --> 00:26:53.660
community right now is that
X-Box live indie games has

534
00:26:53.660 --> 00:26:55.550
been around now for two
years. But if you talk

535
00:26:55.550 --> 00:26:57.980
to people, they either don't
know about it or they

536
00:26:57.980 --> 00:27:00.800
say, Oh, that's where all
those massage apps or avatar

537
00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.980
games are when really there's
like a wide variety of

538
00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:06.740
games we have over. I
think it's almost like 1,050

539
00:27:06.740 --> 00:27:09.500
games in the marketplace currently.
So there's really something in

540
00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.420
there for everybody. And there's
a lot of very polished

541
00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:15.020
games, but it's it's how
do we make that perception

542
00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:18.770
that's been achieved over the
last two years and you

543
00:27:18.770 --> 00:27:20.870
know, partially rightfully so. Cause
I mean, anybody can release

544
00:27:20.870 --> 00:27:23.240
anything they want. And so
when you hit the X

545
00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.860
box live in the game
marketplace and you look at,

546
00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.260
you know, new releases and
any given week when we're

547
00:27:27.260 --> 00:27:30.080
releasing, we're releasing basically three
games a day on average

548
00:27:30.140 --> 00:27:33.200
right now from the community.
And on any given day,

549
00:27:33.230 --> 00:27:35.240
you know, of those three
games, it's not really expected

550
00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.680
that, you know, all three
of those games will be

551
00:27:36.680 --> 00:27:39.800
highly polished and it works
of art. So when someone

552
00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:42.650
goes into the store to
look at these games and

553
00:27:42.650 --> 00:27:44.570
they're obviously gonna look at
the new releases, cause that's

554
00:27:44.570 --> 00:27:46.670
what they're used to doing
with Xbox live arcade games.

555
00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:49.700
They're going to see, you
know, maybe one decent looking

556
00:27:49.700 --> 00:27:51.740
game out of a list
of, you know, 25 to

557
00:27:51.740 --> 00:27:55.160
50. And so it's like,
you know, how do we

558
00:27:55.160 --> 00:27:57.680
manage that perception? And so
we're kind of talking with

559
00:27:57.680 --> 00:27:59.990
Microsoft right now and talking
to in the community, you

560
00:27:59.990 --> 00:28:01.670
know, how, how can we
change this? You know, maybe,

561
00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:03.740
maybe new releases doesn't make
sense for people to land

562
00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:05.540
on me. That should not
be the landing page because

563
00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:07.400
that's not like, you know,
it does, it doesn't like

564
00:28:07.490 --> 00:28:09.950
equal what it does for
Xbox live arcade. Cause Xbox

565
00:28:09.950 --> 00:28:12.830
live arcade has a very,
you know, it's Microsoft controls

566
00:28:12.830 --> 00:28:14.900
like the release schedule for
X box lubricate. They try

567
00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.550
not to flood the market
with too many Xbox live

568
00:28:16.550 --> 00:28:19.310
arcade games. They're polished games
that went through a very

569
00:28:19.430 --> 00:28:23.000
intensive, you know, QA system.
Whereas, you know, Xbox elevating

570
00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.300
the game, anybody can make
anything. So it's a different

571
00:28:27.890 --> 00:28:29.570
type of experience. And we
got to kind of figure

572
00:28:29.570 --> 00:28:32.120
out how to, how to
change what people were seeing.

573
00:28:33.530 --> 00:28:38.140
Yeah. I've noticed that myself
sitting in my, in my

574
00:28:38.150 --> 00:28:41.810
living room and looking at
these games and, and to

575
00:28:41.810 --> 00:28:43.760
be clear to the listeners,
I don't know any of

576
00:28:43.760 --> 00:28:46.550
these peoples, if I mention
a particular game or not,

577
00:28:46.640 --> 00:28:49.640
this is just my opinion.
It's nothing else. But like

578
00:28:49.670 --> 00:28:51.860
I see a game here
that says it's called minor

579
00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:56.420
dig deep. And the, the
box, you know, quote unquote,

580
00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:01.280
the box shop looks like
a child drew it and

581
00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:03.470
I'll say, well, this is
a lame looking box top.

582
00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:05.810
I think this looks lame.
And then I'll look at

583
00:29:05.810 --> 00:29:07.910
the screenshot and I'll say,
well, that looks actually kind

584
00:29:07.910 --> 00:29:10.940
of nice. So I balanced
my perception of the game

585
00:29:10.940 --> 00:29:14.660
based on like in this
case, low points for box

586
00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:17.990
shot, which sounds ridiculous. Like
what does the box have

587
00:29:17.990 --> 00:29:20.600
to do with the gameplay?
But it does affect what

588
00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.610
you think about like this
person put effort into it.

589
00:29:22.610 --> 00:29:24.890
It's like, Oh yeah, Definitely.
It's actually one of the

590
00:29:24.890 --> 00:29:26.540
things I recommend to people
that if they're gonna invest

591
00:29:26.750 --> 00:29:29.030
as an indie game developer,
if they want to pay

592
00:29:29.030 --> 00:29:32.960
for anything, pay for your
box art. So spend a

593
00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:35.210
couple hundred dollars to pay
for some decent looking cover

594
00:29:35.210 --> 00:29:39.440
art. Yeah. Yeah, exactly. And
then, like, for example, I'm

595
00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:44.290
looking at this inside and
it's almost like the box

596
00:29:44.290 --> 00:29:47.620
is a ripoff of like
a classic sports game, like

597
00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:50.500
Madden. Right. And when I
say rip off, I don't

598
00:29:50.500 --> 00:29:52.690
mean like rip off. I
mean more like let's say

599
00:29:52.750 --> 00:29:56.620
homage, but it's like, wow,
okay. This person is effectively

600
00:29:56.620 --> 00:29:59.320
saying with their box art,
that lacrosse is a cool

601
00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:03.730
game that electronic arts has
ignored. So I'm making a

602
00:30:03.730 --> 00:30:06.160
lacrosse game and then you
look at the screenshots and

603
00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:08.830
it looks like that's exactly
what it is. Then you

604
00:30:08.830 --> 00:30:10.300
balance it with the fact
that it's four and a

605
00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:13.120
half stars rated by a
lot of people. And you

606
00:30:13.120 --> 00:30:15.820
say, well, there you go
here. Here's a perfect example

607
00:30:15.820 --> 00:30:20.170
where someone, someone, a developer
felt that the regular marketplace

608
00:30:20.170 --> 00:30:25.090
was not serving him and
went and fixed that problem,

609
00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.380
which I think is pretty
cool. Yeah. I mean, it's,

610
00:30:29.380 --> 00:30:32.250
it's one of the best
things about indie games is

611
00:30:32.250 --> 00:30:35.190
that you can basically attempt
anything. I mean, it's, it's

612
00:30:35.190 --> 00:30:38.070
a perfect sandbox to try
anything you want to, there's

613
00:30:38.070 --> 00:30:39.480
a game out. It, it
doesn't exist. You have the

614
00:30:39.480 --> 00:30:42.960
power to go make that.
It's interesting though, that you

615
00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.720
spend so much decision making
process on, you know, Oh,

616
00:30:45.730 --> 00:30:47.580
look at the box. Art,
look at the rating, look

617
00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:50.310
at the stars because most
of the games are a

618
00:30:50.310 --> 00:30:55.020
dollar. It's strange that like
people on their phones do

619
00:30:55.020 --> 00:30:57.720
all these impulse buys and
don't seem to really care.

620
00:30:58.110 --> 00:30:59.940
But when they're sitting down
in their living room, looking

621
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.030
through their Xbox three 60,
somehow that desire to do

622
00:31:03.030 --> 00:31:04.860
impulse buys goes away or
they don't seem to think

623
00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:08.220
about it. I've seen the
other day, a major Nelson

624
00:31:08.220 --> 00:31:10.950
was tweeting about how this
big game was on sale

625
00:31:10.950 --> 00:31:13.260
and it was $25. And
I replied to him, I

626
00:31:13.260 --> 00:31:18.240
was like, that's 25 indie
games. So you're telling me,

627
00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:20.670
you can buy this, you
know, studio produced game that

628
00:31:20.670 --> 00:31:23.670
for on sale for $25.
And you're going to get

629
00:31:23.670 --> 00:31:27.840
more fun than potentially 25
original creative polished games that

630
00:31:27.840 --> 00:31:29.490
no one seems to know
or talk about. Like it

631
00:31:29.640 --> 00:31:30.960
it's so foreign to me
that we're not getting the

632
00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:33.030
impulse buys. We think we
should be getting like, we're,

633
00:31:33.030 --> 00:31:34.980
we're trying to figure out
what's going on there as

634
00:31:34.980 --> 00:31:37.610
well. Why, why do people
not think about that? Why

635
00:31:37.650 --> 00:31:40.320
don't we get impulse buys?
No, that's a really good

636
00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:42.660
question. I mean, I have,
you know, I've got an

637
00:31:42.660 --> 00:31:49.310
iPhone and I've spent probably
10 bucks a month on,

638
00:31:49.310 --> 00:31:54.600
on, on 99 cent games. But
when I go to the

639
00:31:54.630 --> 00:31:59.670
marketplace, you know, I mean,
honestly you can tell your

640
00:31:59.730 --> 00:32:02.880
there'll be listening to this.
You can tell your, your

641
00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:07.440
indie game friends that, that
box art is significant, the

642
00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:10.710
title of the game and
the box art. And then

643
00:32:10.710 --> 00:32:13.170
also when you have a
lot of these things, like

644
00:32:13.170 --> 00:32:17.280
I'm looking at the indie
games and I see, I'm

645
00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.890
just kinda like scrolling through
this giant creative, like 90

646
00:32:19.890 --> 00:32:23.220
games. I see a lot
of games for like how,

647
00:32:23.220 --> 00:32:25.860
you know, how to meet
women. And like you said,

648
00:32:25.890 --> 00:32:30.120
massage games, just things that
seem very, very childish and

649
00:32:30.120 --> 00:32:34.440
kind of unprofessional. And then
after you scroll past like

650
00:32:34.440 --> 00:32:38.190
10 or 20 of those,
you'll, you'll, you'll find something

651
00:32:38.190 --> 00:32:42.080
that looks like a, a
real game, you know? Yeah.

652
00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.290
The penny arcade guys talked
about it. Like it's going

653
00:32:44.290 --> 00:32:47.880
to like a Bazaar or
like bargain Ben dumpster diving

654
00:32:47.890 --> 00:32:50.800
type thing. Like basically you
have to like wander around

655
00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:52.960
and look around the corner.
And then often the corner,

656
00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:55.510
you see this great gym,
but like you, it's the

657
00:32:55.510 --> 00:32:57.550
unfortunate thing about the way
the marketplace is for us

658
00:32:57.550 --> 00:32:59.650
right now is that you
actually have to hunt for

659
00:32:59.650 --> 00:33:01.180
the good ones. They're not
just right there in your

660
00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:03.760
face. I mean, we could
list the good ones. We

661
00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.830
all know the good ones,
but it's hard to get

662
00:33:05.830 --> 00:33:08.260
that to the, and it's
because that new releases list

663
00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:11.290
is what people see. I
mean, well, we have no

664
00:33:11.290 --> 00:33:13.270
way of guaranteeing that the
releases are going to be

665
00:33:13.270 --> 00:33:16.420
what's what's, you know, what's
great. And it's also interesting

666
00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:19.810
because I mean like the,
the X-Box market is like,

667
00:33:20.290 --> 00:33:25.360
the demographic is just so
skewed and people were making

668
00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.420
the games that people were
buying currently. Some of our,

669
00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:31.240
you know, our great games
just aren't getting purchased. And

670
00:33:31.240 --> 00:33:34.930
so what's happening is good.
Developers are leaving the system

671
00:33:34.930 --> 00:33:37.570
or looking elsewhere, or, you
know, they don't see the

672
00:33:37.570 --> 00:33:41.650
point because people don't want
to buy those date games

673
00:33:41.650 --> 00:33:44.350
and all those avatar games
and, you know, fart apps.

674
00:33:45.670 --> 00:33:48.270
And so it's, how do
we get like the, the

675
00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:51.190
more professional, you know, market
who's going to spend, you

676
00:33:51.190 --> 00:33:54.900
know, lots of money to
start making the purchases on

677
00:33:54.910 --> 00:33:57.430
some, some of these decent
games to attract more developers

678
00:33:57.490 --> 00:33:59.590
so that like the, the
cycle goes the other way.

679
00:34:01.660 --> 00:34:05.500
If the marketplace is broken,
if the way, and if

680
00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:07.990
the way people find these
games is, is broken in

681
00:34:07.990 --> 00:34:11.680
the sense of like I'm
scrolling through, you know, the

682
00:34:11.680 --> 00:34:13.780
website's pretty good though. I
mean, I've got like best-selling

683
00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:16.510
today, top rated, but these
are all things that I

684
00:34:16.510 --> 00:34:19.570
can use right now to
make a decision. You know,

685
00:34:19.960 --> 00:34:22.720
I can just say sort
by top rated and just,

686
00:34:22.750 --> 00:34:27.490
just using box art as
a, as a, as a,

687
00:34:27.670 --> 00:34:30.940
you know, a personal litmus
test. If I go and

688
00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.180
switch it to top rated
immediately, everything with a nice

689
00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.550
box are that is highly
rated. It looks good shows

690
00:34:36.550 --> 00:34:38.530
up. I mean, all that
stuff that we just talked

691
00:34:38.530 --> 00:34:42.490
about that we don't want
to see does disappear. Right.

692
00:34:42.700 --> 00:34:44.400
That's what we keep saying
is that we think that

693
00:34:44.420 --> 00:34:46.570
has a lot to do
with his, and the other

694
00:34:46.570 --> 00:34:48.460
thing that you're, you're on
the web right now, most

695
00:34:48.460 --> 00:34:50.920
people don't use the web
interface. Most people use the

696
00:34:51.190 --> 00:34:54.310
Xbox dashboard. That's just my
point on the web interface.

697
00:34:54.310 --> 00:34:57.430
I can see 90 games
toss sorted by top rated

698
00:34:57.430 --> 00:35:00.360
and then buy them here.
But on the webs, on

699
00:35:00.390 --> 00:35:02.470
the, on the Xbox, I
see like five and all

700
00:35:02.470 --> 00:35:04.570
I see is box. Yeah.
Well, that's one of the

701
00:35:04.570 --> 00:35:07.900
neat things with the new
dashboard update is that now

702
00:35:07.900 --> 00:35:12.160
you will see 50 ratings.
We're only seeing, you know,

703
00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:14.410
five to six at the
time, depending on how big

704
00:35:14.410 --> 00:35:17.020
your TV is, but there
is the list is now

705
00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.380
54 scrolling. So that's, that's
a nice change for us,

706
00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:22.930
but we still need to,
you know, kind of change,

707
00:35:22.930 --> 00:35:25.360
you know, what, what, what
people were seeing first when

708
00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:29.590
they hit that marketplace. Absolutely.
Absolutely. Do you think you're

709
00:35:29.590 --> 00:35:32.640
going to leave because of
this? I mean, I mean,

710
00:35:32.640 --> 00:35:34.900
I don't know. I assume
you're still having fun or

711
00:35:34.900 --> 00:35:38.470
you would have stopped by
now. No, I mean, I

712
00:35:38.490 --> 00:35:40.380
love this. I mean, I
love this community. I love

713
00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.360
what I do. I mean,
I get to make games

714
00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:44.640
for the three 60. I
mean, it's like the, I

715
00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:46.590
don't know, since I was
a young kid, I mean,

716
00:35:46.590 --> 00:35:48.150
the whole reason I even
got into development was for,

717
00:35:48.210 --> 00:35:51.270
for games. So I didn't,
I don't think I ever

718
00:35:51.270 --> 00:35:53.520
really truly believed it would
happen. And then ex and

719
00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:54.570
they came along and it
was kind of like a

720
00:35:54.570 --> 00:35:56.340
flu club. Like a lot
of things just lined up

721
00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:59.070
in the right time. And
no, I love this community.

722
00:35:59.370 --> 00:36:01.350
There's so much to do.
I mean, I'm writing a

723
00:36:01.350 --> 00:36:04.080
book for a windows phone
seven right now for game

724
00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:06.330
development. So, I mean, I'm
planning on being around and

725
00:36:06.330 --> 00:36:09.210
involved quite a bit. One
of the cool things about

726
00:36:09.210 --> 00:36:12.930
this is the X and
a team, the developers themselves

727
00:36:12.930 --> 00:36:15.720
are super active and involved
in the community. One of

728
00:36:15.720 --> 00:36:17.760
the lead developers for the
team is actually at one

729
00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:20.130
of the highest posters on
our question and answer forum.

730
00:36:20.970 --> 00:36:23.760
So I think that's fairly
rare. I don't know of

731
00:36:23.760 --> 00:36:26.820
too many other Microsoft technical
communities that have like the

732
00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:31.320
developer actually being with the
highest posters. Very cool. So

733
00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:34.290
it's definitely a team that
listens and I don't know

734
00:36:34.290 --> 00:36:38.730
that the community just, it's
a really interesting and neat

735
00:36:38.730 --> 00:36:41.940
experience. Like just being among
all these indie game developers

736
00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:43.950
who are, you know, everyone's
coming at it from different

737
00:36:43.950 --> 00:36:45.240
angles. A lot of these
guys are trying to make

738
00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:47.010
a go of it as
a full time business and

739
00:36:47.220 --> 00:36:49.080
they hang out on Twitter
all the time. They're pretty

740
00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:52.620
involved in the forums and
it's a great, great support

741
00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.440
network. I mean, counsel ideas
off each other, helping each

742
00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:58.590
other Polish the games. So
it's definitely created, I'm planning

743
00:36:58.590 --> 00:37:01.820
on being a part of,
for quite awhile. All right.

744
00:37:01.820 --> 00:37:03.590
Well, thanks so much for
talking to me today and

745
00:37:04.010 --> 00:37:07.130
folks can check out George's
website and blog and Twitter,

746
00:37:07.130 --> 00:37:10.640
like linked to him from
X and a development.com. And

747
00:37:10.640 --> 00:37:12.890
I'll also add a bunch
of the sites that we

748
00:37:12.890 --> 00:37:15.500
talked about in the show
notes. Thanks a lot for

749
00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.040
talking to me today. No,
thank you. This has been

750
00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:22.130
another episode of Hanselminutes and
we'll see you again next

751
00:37:22.130 --> 00:37:22.430
week.
