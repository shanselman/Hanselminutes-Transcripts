It's a weekly discussion with
web developer and technologist Scott

9
00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:58.880
Hanselman. This is Lawrence Ryan announcing
show number four 90. In

10
00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:02.870
this episode, Scott talks with
Kaia Thomas about computer science

11
00:01:02.870 --> 00:01:09.110
in school versus the real
world. Hi, this is Scott

12
00:01:09.110 --> 00:01:12.020
Hanselman. This is another episode
of Hansel minutes, and today

13
00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:15.260
I'm chatting with Kaia Thomas
and she is a junior

14
00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:18.170
at Dartmouth and has an
internship right now. And where

15
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.930
are you interning? I'm interning
at into it right now.

16
00:01:21.380 --> 00:01:24.290
That's very cool. Are you
working on iOS apps? Yes,

17
00:01:24.290 --> 00:01:27.410
I'm working on the mint
app, the financial budgeting planning

18
00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:31.910
app. So you're at an
impressive school and at an

19
00:01:31.910 --> 00:01:35.810
impressive company, but I remember
when I was in school,

20
00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:37.970
I wasn't too impressed with
the kind of programming that

21
00:01:37.970 --> 00:01:41.090
we're doing. It was pretty
theoretical, but again, I was

22
00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:43.190
at a kind of a
community college. Well, Dartmouth is

23
00:01:43.190 --> 00:01:45.680
a top tier school. What
is it like to program

24
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:49.130
in college and do the
professors like really understand what's

25
00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.970
going on in the real
world? It's really different. I,

26
00:01:53.510 --> 00:01:57.080
I really enjoy it. I
think that it's important because

27
00:01:57.080 --> 00:01:59.990
I'm getting the foundation and
without it, I don't think

28
00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:02.720
I would have been able
to transition so easily into

29
00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:07.220
the work world. I think
that studying computer science, it

30
00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:10.010
makes it really easy for
me to learn new languages.

31
00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:13.070
So for me to learn
something new, doesn't take as

32
00:02:13.070 --> 00:02:15.290
long. I think if I
didn't have that kind of

33
00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:19.010
traditional foundation, but I think
the difference is working on

34
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.740
a team in a real
world engineering team, where you

35
00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:25.160
have a cycle of like
a work cycle and you

36
00:02:25.250 --> 00:02:28.220
you're doing, you know, version
control. It's a very different

37
00:02:28.220 --> 00:02:31.010
than in school where you're
taking tests and you do

38
00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:34.220
a onetime project and then
it's done. Right? I think

39
00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:36.860
the, one of the main
difference is the maintenance part,

40
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:39.410
because when you learn something
in school and you take

41
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:42.500
a class, the class ends,
right. But when you're in

42
00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:45.110
the real world, you put
out a product, it just

43
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:48.230
doesn't end. It continues. It's
something that you have to

44
00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.140
maintain and keep up with.
And I think that's a

45
00:02:51.170 --> 00:02:54.380
concept that a lot of
students miss. Don't you think

46
00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:59.140
that in school kids could
be taught differently? Like, why

47
00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:01.690
didn't you like welcome to
computer science? One Oh one.

48
00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:04.450
Let's talk about source control.
You know, I remember when

49
00:03:04.450 --> 00:03:06.190
I was, when I was
in school, we just zipped

50
00:03:06.190 --> 00:03:10.000
up our assignments. There's like
chapter one.zip. Yep. Okay. So

51
00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.470
it's like that at Dartmouth
too. So I don't feel

52
00:03:11.470 --> 00:03:13.860
so bad. Yeah, no, don't
feel bad at all. So

53
00:03:13.860 --> 00:03:17.460
we, there is some classes
that use version control, but

54
00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:20.010
they only use them for
usually like the later group

55
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:24.540
projects. And it's usually a
mess. My experience is that

56
00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:29.040
students don't understand version control.
And usually it's a horrible

57
00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:32.370
experience because no one knows
like how to use it.

58
00:03:32.400 --> 00:03:34.710
And everyone's working on the
same thing. So you can

59
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:37.440
never merge correctly and it
just ends up being a

60
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.380
disaster. So a lot of
the times you do have

61
00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.340
to literally zip your files,
send them, put them on

62
00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.850
Blackboard or canvas, and it's
very kind of archaic. It

63
00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:50.520
would be great if they
use version control, like right

64
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.220
off the bat. But I
think the problem is with

65
00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:57.210
that is it's overwhelming to
learn version control at the

66
00:03:57.210 --> 00:04:00.480
same time that you're learning
how to just code is

67
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:04.320
really hard. So I think
that they try, there's like

68
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:07.470
give and takes. I think
when you at Dartmouth, the

69
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:09.990
computer science intro class teaches
you a lot of cool

70
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:13.740
things. You learn how to
use IDs, you learn how

71
00:04:13.740 --> 00:04:16.740
to create games and different
things. And it's, it's a

72
00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:21.240
really kind of good intro
into coding, but I think

73
00:04:21.270 --> 00:04:23.460
there should be something else
that's kind of like real

74
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:25.590
world. Like, what's it like
to be a real engineer

75
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.250
that would kind of go
into Virgin control and understanding

76
00:04:29.250 --> 00:04:32.310
how to really work on
engineering. So the fact that

77
00:04:32.310 --> 00:04:34.470
you said it was overwhelming
is kind of, is a

78
00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:36.900
reminder too. I think those
of us that are listening,

79
00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.150
who've been doing this for
a while, is that there's

80
00:04:39.150 --> 00:04:41.430
a lot of moving parts.
Like there's a bunch of

81
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:45.480
contexts that we just assume
people have. Like, I just

82
00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:48.780
figured I was like born
knowing how a JPEG worked

83
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:52.590
or whatever. Right. How much
is that? I guess I

84
00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:55.470
would call it kind of
like ambient knowledge or knowledge

85
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:58.650
that comes in via osmosis.
Like when I was a

86
00:04:58.650 --> 00:05:03.030
kid like peer like 13,
right? Like I remember messing

87
00:05:03.030 --> 00:05:06.450
around in like ms. Paint
and learning how bitmaps worked

88
00:05:06.450 --> 00:05:08.910
and just like doing a
hex editor and stuff. But

89
00:05:08.910 --> 00:05:10.170
I just was, I didn't
know what I was doing.

90
00:05:10.170 --> 00:05:12.960
I was just poking at
bitmaps. Right. Yeah. But my

91
00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:16.290
13 year old nephew, he
just has a different brain

92
00:05:16.470 --> 00:05:19.770
and he just doesn't get
it. So how much information

93
00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:24.300
did you come with like
that you just absorbed and

94
00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:26.100
how do you, how do
you feel about that? Yeah,

95
00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:28.740
I think that our generation
is a little bit different.

96
00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:32.940
I think usually how people
end up coming across ever

97
00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:36.000
having program without knowing that
they were programming is like

98
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.420
via like my space and,
and Neo pets and stuff

99
00:05:39.420 --> 00:05:41.610
like that. And like, that's
how, where I'm coming from.

100
00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:45.240
My first introduction to any
type of coding or programming

101
00:05:45.240 --> 00:05:49.230
was literally just copying, pasting,
HTML on my MySpace page

102
00:05:49.230 --> 00:05:52.200
and like changing colors and
stuff like that. So I

103
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:55.380
think a lot of people
have come across programming like

104
00:05:55.380 --> 00:05:57.740
that, but they don't know
what it is. They don't

105
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:01.610
have any context there, but
it's not intuitive because when

106
00:06:01.610 --> 00:06:03.500
you go to school, it's
not that at all. You're

107
00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:07.310
not doing HTML. You're not
creating web pages or anything

108
00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.190
like that. You're okay. Like
how can you create a

109
00:06:10.190 --> 00:06:13.370
software that is like, acts
like a bank account Stipe

110
00:06:13.670 --> 00:06:16.160
type of thing like that,
or let's create a game

111
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.900
where you have two balls
and you need to hit

112
00:06:17.900 --> 00:06:20.210
it against the wall. And
so it's very different. It's

113
00:06:20.210 --> 00:06:23.630
not, it would be great
if it was something like,

114
00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:27.560
okay, you use Facebook. So
how is Facebook made? But

115
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.250
it's, it's not like that.
I think that the main

116
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:34.490
point is like just kind
of learning the foundation without

117
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:37.880
really connecting it to how
they interact with technology every

118
00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:40.960
day. So do you think
that classes in college even

119
00:06:40.960 --> 00:06:43.450
today are just too abstract
because like you just said,

120
00:06:43.690 --> 00:06:46.870
let's, let's dissect Facebook. Like
I could see an entire

121
00:06:46.870 --> 00:06:49.600
class where you just like
hit F 12 tools in

122
00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.660
the browser and just mess
around on Facebook. Like what's

123
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:54.940
going on here? That seems
like a cool class. You're

124
00:06:54.940 --> 00:06:57.790
not taking that class. Nope.
I would. I would take

125
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.030
that class for sure. I
think at school there's and

126
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.370
there's so much stuff online,
like let's rebuild, rebuild Twitter

127
00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:05.560
and stuff like that. And
there's so many online resources

128
00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:10.000
like that, but classes really,
I think that's, that's something

129
00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.040
that professors, especially because professors
tend to be older. They're

130
00:07:15.040 --> 00:07:18.460
not necessarily dialed into that
space. They're not necessarily using

131
00:07:18.460 --> 00:07:21.550
Facebook or Pinterest or Twitter
and stuff like that. So

132
00:07:21.550 --> 00:07:24.190
they might necessarily not necessarily
get the value in that

133
00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:27.010
and connecting students to say,
Hey, look, this is the

134
00:07:27.010 --> 00:07:29.410
stuff you use every day.
You use apps, you use

135
00:07:29.410 --> 00:07:32.440
these websites, you can actually
make it. And like, here's

136
00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.020
how let's do this step
by step. It's more like,

137
00:07:35.020 --> 00:07:37.900
okay, let's teach you the
foundation of programming. How do

138
00:07:37.900 --> 00:07:40.420
you, you know, what's a
hash map and like, how

139
00:07:40.420 --> 00:07:42.370
do you have a four
loop? And that's great. You

140
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:45.400
need that to be an
engineer, but that's just the

141
00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.250
very beginning. That's just the
surface point. Isn't that? Where

142
00:07:48.250 --> 00:07:50.980
we lose people though, because
like everything you were saying,

143
00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:54.430
there was super interesting until
you said hash map. And

144
00:07:54.430 --> 00:07:58.540
then I felt my inner
teenager be like, ah, you

145
00:07:58.540 --> 00:07:59.950
know what I mean? Like,
I can just hear people

146
00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:02.170
saying, how is this practical?
And like, and this is

147
00:08:02.170 --> 00:08:03.940
where I think why we
end up with a certain

148
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:07.900
personality type in programming because
one kind of person was

149
00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:10.720
like, Ooh, hash map. What's
that? And another one's like,

150
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:14.590
Oh man, that's really abstract.
Like, Yeah, it's very true.

151
00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:16.360
I think that we miss
out on a lot of

152
00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:19.420
people who probably would be
interested in programming, but there's,

153
00:08:19.420 --> 00:08:23.140
the language is very abstract
and confusing and can be

154
00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:25.180
just, you lose a lot
of people. I've tried to

155
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:27.400
get a lot of my
friends to take CS and

156
00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:30.010
they just get really disinterested
because when they hear, when

157
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:32.230
I tell them, yeah, like
I make apps and like,

158
00:08:32.230 --> 00:08:34.120
it's so fun, you should
definitely try it. You know,

159
00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.520
you can make websites. And
then they take the class.

160
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:39.340
They're like, Oh, I thought
I was going to be

161
00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:43.150
making apps and websites. So
that's my next question. You

162
00:08:43.150 --> 00:08:45.100
that I'm trying to teach
my seven year old, how

163
00:08:45.100 --> 00:08:48.640
to build some stuff. And
we sat down and you

164
00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:50.950
know, we're on Skype. So
you can see me while

165
00:08:50.950 --> 00:08:53.860
the people who are, are
listening. Can't we plugged in

166
00:08:53.860 --> 00:08:57.330
a, what's called a photon
and an led. So we

167
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:59.160
made it. So you push
a button and a light

168
00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.480
turns on, okay, this took
two hours. His attention span

169
00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.960
is not two hours. So
I think that people come

170
00:09:06.960 --> 00:09:08.970
into computer science thinking they're
going to build a game

171
00:09:08.970 --> 00:09:10.860
in a week or two.
And they discover it's a

172
00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:14.030
year long process. And they're
a little depressed about Yeah,

173
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:17.690
exactly. I mean, it's that
it's because technology is such

174
00:09:17.690 --> 00:09:20.630
an instant thing, right? You
expect the process of learning

175
00:09:20.630 --> 00:09:24.560
it to be instant as
well. That I didn't even

176
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.480
think about that because people
sit there and like pull

177
00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.990
the refresh, boom. More likes
like app building should be

178
00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:32.510
that fast. Exactly. And it's
not like that. I think

179
00:09:32.510 --> 00:09:36.170
that that's, that's one reason
I've seen a lot of

180
00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:38.720
people drop out of computer
science because it's such a

181
00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:41.690
huge time commitment. You have,
you really have to spend

182
00:09:41.690 --> 00:09:46.730
the time learning and constantly
building your skills, but most

183
00:09:46.730 --> 00:09:49.340
people are don't really have
that attention span. Like you

184
00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:52.880
said, Now you said that
you tried to get some

185
00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:56.780
of your friends involved. Have
you had any successes? Yeah.

186
00:09:56.810 --> 00:09:59.570
I actually have had some
successes. I've had, I have,

187
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:02.480
I'm a TA and a
section leader. I'm in the

188
00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:06.350
computer science department. So I
lead some of the sections

189
00:10:06.350 --> 00:10:08.420
for some of the intro
courses and some of the

190
00:10:08.420 --> 00:10:11.570
upper level courses. And so
I've had success of people

191
00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:14.390
sticking through it and like
just working with people, I

192
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:16.490
think it takes, you know,
it takes support and it,

193
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:20.390
you need sometimes that mentorship
really. So just trying to

194
00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:22.850
support people and let them
know that yes, it's hard,

195
00:10:22.850 --> 00:10:26.090
but they can still do
it. One of the tactics

196
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.860
that I've been taking and
I'm interested in, whether you

197
00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:31.550
think it's a good idea
is to make it understood

198
00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:35.480
to people that coding is
power. It is like it

199
00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.000
is full on the power
to make the power to

200
00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.450
change. Is that a something
that resonates with younger people?

201
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:46.100
I think it does. It
depends on the, it depends

202
00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.800
on the person. I think
that everyone's in a different

203
00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:51.260
stage in their life, especially
in college, everyone's at a

204
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:55.970
different stage, but for those
people who are really who

205
00:10:55.970 --> 00:10:59.420
are really motivated and empowered
by the thought that, Hey,

206
00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:02.870
you can build something and
you can launch it and

207
00:11:02.870 --> 00:11:05.000
millions of people can be
using it. And you can

208
00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.910
impact millions of people's lives
all over the world because

209
00:11:07.910 --> 00:11:10.940
you know, technology is a
global, a global thing. I

210
00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:14.540
think those people who are
motivated to kind of benefit

211
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.900
people's lives in a really
innovative way would definitely love

212
00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:20.360
that. And that, for me,
that's why I love technology

213
00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:23.150
so much because I feel
like whatever I build, whatever

214
00:11:23.150 --> 00:11:26.420
I make, I can impact
people's lives all over almost

215
00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:30.770
instantaneously. So that's a perfect
segue to kind of go

216
00:11:30.770 --> 00:11:33.230
from where you started, which
was my space and hacking

217
00:11:33.230 --> 00:11:36.110
your own pages, but you
didn't stay as a web

218
00:11:36.110 --> 00:11:38.420
programmer, even though you have
a great webpage. And you've

219
00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:41.840
got a really nice YouTube
channel called COVID <inaudible> you

220
00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:45.950
are mobile developer. Yes, I
am. I, I really love

221
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:48.800
mobile development for me. The
reason why is I started

222
00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.470
out doing web development and
it was fun, but I

223
00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:56.530
felt that when I started
doing mobile development, that I

224
00:11:56.530 --> 00:11:59.380
actually was able to interact
with the users as I

225
00:11:59.380 --> 00:12:02.800
was developing, not actually talking
to them, but as you're

226
00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:05.410
developing for mobile, every step
of the way is you're

227
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:09.430
thinking about interactivity, right? Every
single, every single thing that

228
00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:12.330
they're doing, the user is
interacting with the app. I

229
00:12:12.330 --> 00:12:15.900
see every touch, every click
matters. Exactly everything matters. And

230
00:12:15.900 --> 00:12:19.020
I felt like, wow, like
I'm, I feel like the

231
00:12:19.020 --> 00:12:21.360
user as I'm making this.
And it was really cool

232
00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:24.060
because I just didn't get
that with web development as

233
00:12:24.060 --> 00:12:25.470
much. I just felt like
a lot of it was

234
00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.050
kind of static. I didn't
feel like I was really

235
00:12:28.050 --> 00:12:30.780
being engaged with what I
was doing, but when I

236
00:12:30.780 --> 00:12:33.210
was doing mobile, I was
like, wow, like I'm thinking

237
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:35.400
about, they're going to click
here. They're going to do

238
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.530
this. They're going to input
here. And it was just

239
00:12:37.530 --> 00:12:42.810
so interactive. Right? I think
mobile apps are expected to

240
00:12:42.810 --> 00:12:45.650
be animated and, and have
a lot of motion and

241
00:12:45.650 --> 00:12:48.540
a lot of movement while
I feel like there's websites

242
00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:51.990
that are like brochures. Exactly.
And then there's like web

243
00:12:52.020 --> 00:12:53.790
apps and a lot of
web apps. We don't see

244
00:12:53.790 --> 00:12:55.290
them as users. You know,
we, a lot of web

245
00:12:55.290 --> 00:12:58.560
apps where they're behind the
enterprise, they're behind a login.

246
00:12:59.970 --> 00:13:03.840
Okay. So I thought that
Swift is the new hotness,

247
00:13:03.870 --> 00:13:07.170
but you are not into
Swift. You do objective C

248
00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:10.350
objective C is not exactly
a friendly looking language for

249
00:13:10.410 --> 00:13:15.540
a new, No, not. So
I started iOS just when

250
00:13:15.540 --> 00:13:18.800
Swift came out just after
kind of the announcements and

251
00:13:18.830 --> 00:13:23.100
had started learning it and
everything. But weirdly enough, objective

252
00:13:23.100 --> 00:13:26.700
C just, I, I love
it. I actually took a

253
00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:29.580
class in C and I
was like, obsessed. I was

254
00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:32.280
super hype about it. I
think for me, the reason

255
00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:35.310
why I love it, objective
C is you really know

256
00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:38.070
what's going on the entire
time. Right. You have to

257
00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:40.710
really keep up with it.
There's no like you don't

258
00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.850
with Swift and with some
other languages, similar like JavaScript

259
00:13:44.850 --> 00:13:47.160
and Python, you can kind
of code and not really

260
00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:49.320
know what you're doing. So
you don't know what's really

261
00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:51.360
going on in the background.
You have no idea what

262
00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.630
memory is like. You don't
know really what types you're,

263
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.600
you're playing around with. And
so I think with objective

264
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:00.330
C, because it's silver bros,
it forces you to really

265
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:02.730
know what you're doing at
every step of the way.

266
00:14:02.730 --> 00:14:04.830
And I love that. I
love knowing what's going on

267
00:14:05.070 --> 00:14:07.920
and really being intentional and
the things that I'm creating.

268
00:14:08.730 --> 00:14:11.640
That's really interesting because that's
kind of the opposite of

269
00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:14.790
what I hear from a
lot of younger developers. I

270
00:14:14.790 --> 00:14:16.980
love that. You're saying all
of that, because that makes

271
00:14:16.980 --> 00:14:20.160
you a plumber, right? Like
there are people who turn

272
00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:21.930
the faucet and then there
are the people who know

273
00:14:21.930 --> 00:14:24.450
what happens when you turn
the faucet. And you're saying

274
00:14:24.450 --> 00:14:27.630
that you actually enjoy the
intentionality of that, which is

275
00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:31.080
surprising to me. But, but,
but heartening also. Yeah, no,

276
00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:32.940
I, I definitely do it.
And I agree. I have

277
00:14:33.900 --> 00:14:36.630
our intro class at dharmas
and Python and people love

278
00:14:36.630 --> 00:14:39.360
it because it's really easy
to learn. And then when

279
00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:41.130
they get to the upper
level class, which is in

280
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:44.220
C, they kind of just
like, are just like, no,

281
00:14:44.220 --> 00:14:46.860
I can't do this. This
is terrible. But I was

282
00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.610
kind of the opposite, which
was really fun. I want

283
00:14:52.610 --> 00:14:54.470
to take a second to
tell you about my sponsor

284
00:14:54.470 --> 00:14:57.620
Reagan, if you want to
detect and diagnose errors and

285
00:14:57.620 --> 00:15:00.470
crashes in your software and
even find problems that you

286
00:15:00.470 --> 00:15:03.590
didn't know existed to improve
your software. And Reagan is

287
00:15:03.590 --> 00:15:06.650
likely perfect for you. You
just add a few lines

288
00:15:06.650 --> 00:15:09.320
of code your application, and
in minutes you get real

289
00:15:09.320 --> 00:15:12.200
time error reports with all
the information that you need

290
00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:14.660
to fix bugs fast, you
can even hook it up

291
00:15:14.660 --> 00:15:17.420
to your team, chat, your
bug tracking and any other

292
00:15:17.420 --> 00:15:21.980
development, workflow tools, Reagan covers
all major web and mobile

293
00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:26.300
programming languages, including.net, the full
Xamarin stack, JavaScript, and many

294
00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:31.550
more go check out gun
today@raygun.io. I even use it

295
00:15:31.550 --> 00:15:34.820
myself on my little startup
and I really truly recommend

296
00:15:34.820 --> 00:15:40.520
this product. It's a fantastic
product. Check it out, reagan@reagan.io.

297
00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:46.130
So we hear this word
full stack developer all the

298
00:15:46.130 --> 00:15:48.650
time. And I think it's
funny because full stack developer,

299
00:15:49.130 --> 00:15:52.460
when people say it, they
mean like UI to database,

300
00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.950
you know, but I kind
of like when I think

301
00:15:54.950 --> 00:15:56.780
full stack developer, I'm like
all the way down to

302
00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.670
the metal. Like I want
to know what's happening in

303
00:15:58.670 --> 00:16:03.470
the registers in the processor.
Oh, wow. You know, how

304
00:16:03.470 --> 00:16:06.200
far down do you typically
go in your classes? Cause

305
00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.040
you've taken computational linguistics. You've
taken software design. Like you've

306
00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:12.290
gone all the way down
to discreet math. Did you

307
00:16:12.290 --> 00:16:14.510
spend any time in assembler
and things like that at

308
00:16:14.510 --> 00:16:18.910
Dartmouth? So they don't teach
assembly anymore? I don't think,

309
00:16:18.910 --> 00:16:22.090
I think maybe in maybe
some of the security classes,

310
00:16:22.300 --> 00:16:24.850
they might do some assembly
I'm in the class that

311
00:16:24.850 --> 00:16:26.830
I took that was in
C, which was software design

312
00:16:26.830 --> 00:16:29.800
and implementation. We did talk
a little bit about assembly

313
00:16:30.110 --> 00:16:33.490
about what happens when you
actually compiled C code. And

314
00:16:33.490 --> 00:16:35.710
that was pretty cool, but
we actually don't get bare

315
00:16:35.710 --> 00:16:39.850
bones that, that down into
it, there are some hardware

316
00:16:39.850 --> 00:16:42.610
courses in the engineering department
you can probably take. But

317
00:16:42.610 --> 00:16:45.220
for me, I think as
far as I like to

318
00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:50.710
go is like databases. Okay.
So you got your internship

319
00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:53.380
to, at Intuit and working
on mint as a part

320
00:16:53.410 --> 00:16:58.450
of being a code 2040
fellow. Yes. Yes I did.

321
00:16:58.450 --> 00:17:02.470
So code 2040 is an
organization that matches black and

322
00:17:02.470 --> 00:17:07.060
Latino undergraduate or graduate computer
science students with internships in

323
00:17:07.060 --> 00:17:10.960
Silicon Valley. So I wanted
to be a fellow really

324
00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:14.230
bad, so they were able
to get into it on

325
00:17:14.230 --> 00:17:16.900
as a partner. And it
was really, really exciting. So

326
00:17:17.170 --> 00:17:20.050
they matched me and it
was really great. So talk

327
00:17:20.050 --> 00:17:22.840
to me about like that
first day, right? Like you've

328
00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.240
got all the computer science
in your brain, but I

329
00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.220
assume that you've started to
figure out the difference between

330
00:17:27.220 --> 00:17:32.290
computer science and software engineering.
Yeah. I was pretty nervous.

331
00:17:33.010 --> 00:17:35.410
I think that I had
an internship last summer as

332
00:17:35.410 --> 00:17:38.170
well, actually, but it was
different because I was doing

333
00:17:38.230 --> 00:17:41.350
a solo project. So I
was, I wasn't working with

334
00:17:41.350 --> 00:17:43.690
a team, so I really
could kind of just do

335
00:17:43.690 --> 00:17:46.630
whatever I, there was no
code reviews, but it was

336
00:17:46.690 --> 00:17:49.350
a great experience. It was
just very different and knew

337
00:17:49.350 --> 00:17:52.410
coming in to Intuit. I
was going to have code

338
00:17:52.410 --> 00:17:54.090
reviews. I was going to
be on a team. I

339
00:17:54.090 --> 00:17:56.160
was going to be responsible
for a lot. And I

340
00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:58.200
was going to have to
learn from a huge code

341
00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:00.990
base that already existed. So
I think for me, I

342
00:18:00.990 --> 00:18:04.530
was pretty nervous, but luckily
the team that I'm on

343
00:18:04.530 --> 00:18:07.620
is really amazing and they
were just so helpful and

344
00:18:07.620 --> 00:18:10.770
welcoming through that process of
learning the code base. I

345
00:18:10.770 --> 00:18:13.500
think a lot of times
what I found is like

346
00:18:13.530 --> 00:18:15.840
I was getting ready to
create something and it already

347
00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:19.860
existed. So just understanding what's
there and what is it?

348
00:18:20.630 --> 00:18:23.300
So would you agree that
to be a good programmer

349
00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:26.240
is less about writing code
and more about learning to

350
00:18:26.240 --> 00:18:31.160
read? Oh, yes. For sure.
Honestly, I'm like, you're going

351
00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:33.020
to write code a lot
of code, but yes, a

352
00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:36.080
lot of times, especially when
you're working on an existing

353
00:18:36.080 --> 00:18:38.090
project, you're going to have
to go through other people's

354
00:18:38.090 --> 00:18:41.900
code and understand it. And
that's so important. I think

355
00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:45.260
one of the reasons I
love being a TA and

356
00:18:45.260 --> 00:18:47.420
being a section leader is
I grade code. And so

357
00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:50.720
I'm constantly learning how to
understand different types of people's

358
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:53.450
coding styles. And that's so
important when I've gotten to

359
00:18:53.450 --> 00:18:56.480
the work world. It's my
actually I think onboarding and

360
00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:59.090
understanding the code base happens
so much faster because I

361
00:18:59.090 --> 00:19:01.280
was just so much so
used to reading other people's

362
00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:04.160
code. If you wouldn't mind,
give me an idea of

363
00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.170
a kind of task that
you know, you're a couple,

364
00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:08.540
I'm imagining a while back,
you're a couple of weeks

365
00:19:08.540 --> 00:19:10.790
into it. You started to
get a general sense and

366
00:19:10.790 --> 00:19:13.520
then someone assigns you a
task. Are they using scrum?

367
00:19:13.520 --> 00:19:15.440
Is there a sprint? Are
they giving you a couple

368
00:19:15.440 --> 00:19:18.650
of weeks to solve the
problem? Yeah, so we work

369
00:19:18.650 --> 00:19:21.890
on script. We, we were
doing the scrum system. We

370
00:19:21.890 --> 00:19:24.320
also work on sprints. So
we have like two week

371
00:19:24.330 --> 00:19:26.840
sprints where you'll have tasks
that you are assigned and

372
00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:29.120
you need to get done
and daily scrums to keep

373
00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.280
you accountable, to make sure
that you're doing the work.

374
00:19:31.670 --> 00:19:33.140
And when I first started
off, I was getting a

375
00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:36.650
lot of bug fixes, right.
So really getting in understanding

376
00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.110
how to interact with the
code, how to fix little

377
00:19:39.110 --> 00:19:41.990
things. And then like once
I, once I got past

378
00:19:41.990 --> 00:19:44.120
that point and they saw
that I was really capable

379
00:19:44.120 --> 00:19:47.210
of doing more, I started
working on feature additions and

380
00:19:47.210 --> 00:19:49.250
working on new stuff. That's
going to be in the

381
00:19:49.250 --> 00:19:53.660
app. Okay. And are you
doing everything from the back

382
00:19:53.660 --> 00:19:55.970
end? All the way up
through interaction stuff. And like,

383
00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.430
like, like a bug might
be that this button didn't

384
00:19:58.430 --> 00:19:59.780
do what I expect it
to do or is it

385
00:19:59.780 --> 00:20:02.060
air handling? What kind of
stuff you do? Yeah. I'm

386
00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:04.820
not doing any backend stuff.
So they, how they have

387
00:20:04.820 --> 00:20:07.190
it separate, there's like a
whole platform team that does

388
00:20:07.190 --> 00:20:10.100
a lot of the server
and in the database side

389
00:20:10.100 --> 00:20:13.460
stuff. And then for us,
we're mainly doing the interaction

390
00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:15.950
and the front end work
and seeing how the user

391
00:20:15.950 --> 00:20:19.250
is going to engage with
it. And that's all done

392
00:20:19.250 --> 00:20:22.280
in objective C like you
said. Yes. Yes. And it's,

393
00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:24.830
I've, I've have gotten to
interact with Swift a little

394
00:20:24.830 --> 00:20:28.310
bit. What, what they're doing
over here is that if

395
00:20:28.310 --> 00:20:30.710
there's anything new created, it's
going to be in Swift,

396
00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:33.800
but anything old is, may
maintain an objective C and

397
00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:35.840
I've seen a lot of
other teams do that as

398
00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.970
well. And it's actually really
cool. So you get to

399
00:20:37.970 --> 00:20:40.640
interact with both because there
are lots of, you're allowed

400
00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:43.070
to combine objective C and
Swift. So it's like a

401
00:20:43.070 --> 00:20:47.060
good way to kind of
slowly move towards Swift. Can

402
00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:48.940
you ha I mean, I
don't Know much about this.

403
00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:50.410
Can you have an app
that has a little bit

404
00:20:50.410 --> 00:20:52.390
of objective C and Swift
combined in the same app?

405
00:20:52.720 --> 00:20:56.070
Yep. Yup. You can interchange
between objective C and Swift.

406
00:20:56.070 --> 00:20:58.680
I think that's a really
cool thing that they've done

407
00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.550
and it's really easy to
kind of use functions and

408
00:21:02.550 --> 00:21:05.040
things and methods and classes
that you have in objective

409
00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:09.030
C in your Swift code.
Okay, cool. So you not

410
00:21:09.030 --> 00:21:11.850
only work on the mint
iOS team as an intern,

411
00:21:11.850 --> 00:21:13.620
but you also have your
own app in the app

412
00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:14.910
store. Do you have more
than one app in the

413
00:21:14.910 --> 00:21:18.120
app store? No. I just
have one currently. And your

414
00:21:18.120 --> 00:21:21.720
app is a book resource
application called we read two.

415
00:21:22.710 --> 00:21:24.780
And what are you wrote
that in objectives in objective

416
00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:27.420
C as well? I wrote
that in an objective. See,

417
00:21:27.630 --> 00:21:30.570
I've been thinking about migrating
it to Swift, but for

418
00:21:30.570 --> 00:21:33.240
now, like right now, the
maintenance and everything is an

419
00:21:33.240 --> 00:21:37.440
objective And your app right
now, which is an amazing,

420
00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.890
this is an amazing accomplishment.
Has four, has five star

421
00:21:40.890 --> 00:21:43.020
rankings, which means that you
either have a lot of

422
00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:45.600
really happy users or a
lot of really cool friends

423
00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:48.600
because I don't see a
lot of five star apps.

424
00:21:49.050 --> 00:21:52.590
Yeah. I hope it's a
little bit of both. So

425
00:21:52.590 --> 00:21:54.690
talk to me about this
app and how you wrote

426
00:21:54.690 --> 00:21:56.220
it and what the back
end for that is. Cause

427
00:21:56.220 --> 00:21:57.930
you did the full app
from design all the way

428
00:21:57.930 --> 00:22:00.810
to the backend. Yeah, it
was, it was a cool,

429
00:22:00.810 --> 00:22:03.030
really cool process because I
had to do everything. So

430
00:22:03.030 --> 00:22:06.570
the app itself is a
book resource application. That's kind

431
00:22:06.570 --> 00:22:09.750
of like a book directory
of children's and young adult

432
00:22:09.750 --> 00:22:12.750
books, all written by authors
of color. And I created

433
00:22:12.750 --> 00:22:15.450
it because I've always been
a book junkie. I love

434
00:22:15.450 --> 00:22:19.050
reading, I love learning. But
as I got older, I

435
00:22:19.050 --> 00:22:21.330
saw that a lot of
the books that I was

436
00:22:21.330 --> 00:22:23.820
reading, or even being marketed
to me as a teen

437
00:22:23.820 --> 00:22:26.880
and a young person, they
didn't really have characters that

438
00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.700
represented me. So there was
no black female characters who

439
00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:32.520
are like nerdy and I'm
always doing things that I

440
00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:35.100
did. So I felt that
there had to be those

441
00:22:35.100 --> 00:22:37.500
books out there, but it's
just hard to find them.

442
00:22:37.710 --> 00:22:39.870
So I created this resource
so that hopefully there's a

443
00:22:39.870 --> 00:22:43.110
central location here for people
to find these apps, these

444
00:22:43.110 --> 00:22:47.550
books. And is that this
is curated by you. Yeah.

445
00:22:47.550 --> 00:22:49.770
It's curated by me. So
it took a lot of

446
00:22:49.770 --> 00:22:52.110
research. I did about like
a month where I was

447
00:22:52.110 --> 00:22:54.930
just looking for these books
and gathering them and, you

448
00:22:54.930 --> 00:22:57.900
know, making sure I wanted
to make sure the authors

449
00:22:57.900 --> 00:23:00.060
were people of color as
well. So that they're writing

450
00:23:00.270 --> 00:23:04.490
from, from their own like
culture and experiences. So it

451
00:23:04.560 --> 00:23:07.350
took a long time to
kind of curate the book.

452
00:23:08.040 --> 00:23:10.050
So is the list static
or does it pull from

453
00:23:10.050 --> 00:23:12.690
a backend service? It pulls
from backend. So I'm using

454
00:23:12.690 --> 00:23:15.960
parts as the backend and
it was actually so, so

455
00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.450
great to use parts because
I didn't have too much

456
00:23:18.450 --> 00:23:21.690
experience in databases and backend
work, but it really made,

457
00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:24.750
they really make, make it
easy to understand how to

458
00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:28.020
integrate with the backend. Their
SDK for iOS is really

459
00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:30.570
good. So I put all
the books up on there

460
00:23:30.570 --> 00:23:33.360
and it's pulling it's nice.
So anytime I add a

461
00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:35.460
book, you can just reload
and it will be right

462
00:23:35.460 --> 00:23:38.550
there. Yeah. Backend as a
service. I think they call

463
00:23:38.550 --> 00:23:40.230
that. Right. So you don't
even have to think about

464
00:23:40.230 --> 00:23:44.520
the database at all. No,
I understand that you're struggling

465
00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:49.070
with one aspect of the
iPhone store right now, even

466
00:23:49.070 --> 00:23:51.530
though this is a book
for kids, it says that

467
00:23:51.530 --> 00:23:53.630
the iPhone people are insisting
that you must be 17

468
00:23:53.630 --> 00:23:55.880
year olds to download this
app. And that's kind of

469
00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:57.140
one of the things you
have to deal with when

470
00:23:57.140 --> 00:23:59.510
you have a kind of
a garden, a walled garden,

471
00:23:59.510 --> 00:24:02.520
like the security guard, what's
the deal with that? So

472
00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.930
I was really disappointed in
that I had to rate

473
00:24:04.930 --> 00:24:07.990
it so high because it,
it made some parents weary

474
00:24:07.990 --> 00:24:09.910
of it. They were like,
wait, why is this operated

475
00:24:09.910 --> 00:24:12.610
17? And up, is there
like something in there that

476
00:24:12.610 --> 00:24:15.790
my kitchen see? And really,
it's not. It's just because

477
00:24:15.970 --> 00:24:18.010
when you go to any
of the books, you can

478
00:24:18.010 --> 00:24:21.310
see the Safari page. You
can just go straight to

479
00:24:21.310 --> 00:24:23.890
the Amazon page of the
book. And because I allow

480
00:24:23.890 --> 00:24:27.550
you that kind of undirected
access to Safari, they rated

481
00:24:27.550 --> 00:24:31.720
the app 17 plus, which
I understand because parents don't

482
00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:34.840
necessarily want their kids having
access to the internet just

483
00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:37.570
without their guidance. But it
was kind of disappointed because

484
00:24:37.570 --> 00:24:40.720
it is an app that
I want teens and kids

485
00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:42.310
to be able to, you
know, look for books when

486
00:24:42.310 --> 00:24:44.140
they're in the library and
stuff like that, or in

487
00:24:44.140 --> 00:24:46.630
the bookstore. All right. Have
you thought about ways to

488
00:24:46.630 --> 00:24:48.670
get around that? Like, can
you, do you jump, do

489
00:24:48.670 --> 00:24:50.320
you launch into Safari or
do you have like a

490
00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:53.080
constrained web view that you
can prevent them from going

491
00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:57.070
places that they shouldn't go?
Yeah, so I, it's funny

492
00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:59.860
when I actually first made
the app, I had a

493
00:24:59.860 --> 00:25:02.860
web view inside the application
and it was, so it

494
00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:04.660
didn't allow you to go
into Safari. It was just

495
00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:07.750
straight web view, but my
I've got rejected because of

496
00:25:07.750 --> 00:25:12.550
that. They don't allow you
because it's Amazon, you can

497
00:25:12.550 --> 00:25:16.630
buy from, from the Safari
page. And technically that's like

498
00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:21.550
in app purchasing, so, Oh
man. Yeah, that sucks. They

499
00:25:21.550 --> 00:25:24.470
just make us jump through
so many hoops. Yep. Yup.

500
00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.730
I mean, it's, it's a
great, it's, it's interesting process

501
00:25:27.730 --> 00:25:30.430
to, you know, go through
the whole review and Seminole

502
00:25:30.430 --> 00:25:33.070
process. It, it actually caused
me to really think a

503
00:25:33.070 --> 00:25:36.640
lot about kind of what,
what I was making and

504
00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:38.350
like how it was going
to get it out there.

505
00:25:40.870 --> 00:25:43.780
So speaking of being out
there, in addition to all

506
00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.120
this different stuff that you're
doing, you're going to school,

507
00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.130
you're working at Intuit, you're
doing an app on the

508
00:25:48.130 --> 00:25:51.790
side. You also have a
YouTube channel called code with

509
00:25:51.790 --> 00:25:54.550
Kira. You've got tutorials and
blogs and resources and stuff

510
00:25:54.550 --> 00:25:57.250
like that. How do you,
what do you think is

511
00:25:57.250 --> 00:26:02.380
driving you to, to be
so I dunno, just like

512
00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:04.870
public and gregarious. Like some
people just code and they

513
00:26:04.870 --> 00:26:06.550
do their thing and they
go home. Why are you

514
00:26:06.550 --> 00:26:08.470
so excited about this? That
you just, it seems like

515
00:26:08.470 --> 00:26:11.980
you're overflowing with enthusiasm about,
about software. No, I, I

516
00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.080
really love it. I think
for me, the reason why

517
00:26:14.380 --> 00:26:17.230
I've kind of made the
intention of being so out

518
00:26:17.230 --> 00:26:19.600
there and public with the
work that I'm doing is

519
00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:23.440
because I want other, I
want other young people, especially

520
00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:25.870
young people of color to
really see that this is

521
00:26:25.870 --> 00:26:28.150
something that they can be
excited about. And like, if

522
00:26:28.150 --> 00:26:31.090
you're excited about technology, if
you're excited about nerdy things

523
00:26:31.090 --> 00:26:33.730
and you want to create,
like, don't be ashamed, like

524
00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:36.940
go for it, do do
it. And like, if you

525
00:26:36.940 --> 00:26:39.940
have an idea, just try
to learn as much as

526
00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.310
you can and make it.
And I think that's why

527
00:26:42.310 --> 00:26:45.030
I've really been passionate about
trying to get myself out

528
00:26:45.030 --> 00:26:47.970
there and try to have
resources for people to understand

529
00:26:47.970 --> 00:26:50.430
that they can do, they
can make the things that

530
00:26:50.430 --> 00:26:53.070
they use every day. I
think that for me, it

531
00:26:53.070 --> 00:26:58.050
was really transformative to start
making technology because I've always

532
00:26:58.050 --> 00:27:00.690
been so obsessed with technology
my entire life. I've loved

533
00:27:00.690 --> 00:27:03.150
it so much now that
I'm actually creating that same

534
00:27:03.150 --> 00:27:05.880
technology. I just really feel
so powerful. And I want

535
00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.520
everyone else to really, especially
young people of color to

536
00:27:08.520 --> 00:27:10.680
really feel that too. I
want them to feel empowered.

537
00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:14.540
You did a really great
article. You wrote an article

538
00:27:14.780 --> 00:27:17.840
for a website called model
view culture. And we actually

539
00:27:17.840 --> 00:27:20.480
had them on the podcast
before called where are the

540
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:25.430
women in color hackers in
movies? And, you know, I

541
00:27:25.430 --> 00:27:27.380
think that as you know,
I was a random white

542
00:27:27.380 --> 00:27:28.640
guy. I don't really think
about it when a bunch

543
00:27:28.640 --> 00:27:32.090
of random white guys do
something cool movie, but you

544
00:27:32.090 --> 00:27:34.160
call it a really interesting
example in the movie, the

545
00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.350
fast and the furious where
they're looking for this like

546
00:27:36.350 --> 00:27:40.850
mysterious hacker and the mysterious
hacker ended up being. So

547
00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:43.310
it was crazy. I was
watching the movie and I

548
00:27:43.310 --> 00:27:45.800
wasn't really that to engage
in the movie. I was

549
00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:48.170
kind of bored with it.
And then they're talking about

550
00:27:48.170 --> 00:27:50.540
this hacker and they started
talking about this really cool,

551
00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:55.250
like bio hack security technology
that she, that this person

552
00:27:55.250 --> 00:27:57.830
had made. And then they,
they go and find the

553
00:27:57.830 --> 00:28:00.980
person and it turns out
it's a black woman. And

554
00:28:01.010 --> 00:28:04.040
that just blew my mind.
I never saw in like

555
00:28:04.040 --> 00:28:08.420
a movie, especially like a
black woman, hacker created the

556
00:28:08.420 --> 00:28:11.810
software that just like was
central in the whole film.

557
00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:13.940
It really made me so
happy. And I was like

558
00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:16.160
with my friends and I'm
getting all giddy and they're

559
00:28:16.160 --> 00:28:19.940
all laughing. Well, certainly you,
you, you, you kind of

560
00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:21.650
sat up and you're like,
wait a second. I am

561
00:28:21.650 --> 00:28:24.350
engaged in this video. Exactly.
All of a sudden I

562
00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:27.020
was so excited for the
movie. And like, I was

563
00:28:27.020 --> 00:28:29.450
like, Oh my God. Like,
all my friends were like,

564
00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:31.790
wow, of course, like guys
freaking out about this. Cause

565
00:28:31.790 --> 00:28:34.820
they know like I'm a
computer science freak. So it

566
00:28:34.820 --> 00:28:37.490
was so fun. Well, and
I think what's cool about

567
00:28:37.490 --> 00:28:40.850
that was that then Tyrese
who's in fast and furious

568
00:28:40.850 --> 00:28:43.640
seven says, well, you're not
what a hacker supposed to

569
00:28:43.640 --> 00:28:48.410
look like. Yeah. It was
just really like weird conversation

570
00:28:48.410 --> 00:28:51.320
they end up having. So
after they captured her or

571
00:28:51.680 --> 00:28:54.830
found her or whatever, Tyrese
is like your cause, like

572
00:28:54.830 --> 00:28:57.350
he's attracted to her. So
he's like, you're not what

573
00:28:57.350 --> 00:28:59.240
a hacker looks like. You
like, you should, you shouldn't

574
00:28:59.240 --> 00:29:01.910
be behind a computer. You
should be like, my girlfriend

575
00:29:01.910 --> 00:29:05.750
basically, like that's basically what
he was saying. But then

576
00:29:05.750 --> 00:29:08.570
ludicrous, his character actually stood
up for her and was

577
00:29:08.570 --> 00:29:10.910
like, wait, like, cause he
is also playing like a

578
00:29:10.910 --> 00:29:13.550
computer hacker guy. And like,
he was like, wait, so

579
00:29:13.550 --> 00:29:15.560
what does a hacker supposed
to look like? And I

580
00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.630
think it was a really,
really cool, I don't know

581
00:29:17.630 --> 00:29:19.400
if the audience really caught
it or I feel like

582
00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:21.500
anyone in tech would probably
catch that and be like,

583
00:29:21.530 --> 00:29:25.100
feel like, Whoa, like, you
know, meaningful though, isn't it?

584
00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:27.350
Yeah. It was really meaningful
to me because it's like,

585
00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:29.960
it kind of went against
the stereotype. It was like,

586
00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:32.270
Hey look, anyone could be
in hacker. Like it's not

587
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:35.720
about usually in movies. It's
usually like a 16 year

588
00:29:35.720 --> 00:29:40.040
old white guy. And like,
and that's fine, but it

589
00:29:40.040 --> 00:29:43.810
was really great that they
had this kind of contrary

590
00:29:43.810 --> 00:29:48.300
and this dip disrupting the
stereotype. Yup. Yup. Definitely. It

591
00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:50.610
doesn't, it doesn't hurt anybody
to be a little bit

592
00:29:50.610 --> 00:29:52.740
more inclusive and a little
bit more representative with things

593
00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:57.390
like this. Have you watched
the show mr. Robot? No,

594
00:29:57.390 --> 00:30:00.510
I haven't. Okay. So this
is, this is good because

595
00:30:00.510 --> 00:30:02.700
now I get to do
this publicly because you know,

596
00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:05.910
when you love something and
you're, you're a nerd, right?

597
00:30:06.090 --> 00:30:08.100
So then you want to
share it with people and

598
00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:10.770
you find something amazing. Not
only do you want to

599
00:30:10.770 --> 00:30:13.440
share with people, but you
want to like sit with

600
00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.680
them and watch them, watch
that thing. Right. So I'm

601
00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:19.560
ready to like, you need
to watch mr. Robot. Okay.

602
00:30:19.890 --> 00:30:23.550
You call me. I will
watch you watch mr. Robot.

603
00:30:23.760 --> 00:30:26.190
Okay, great. Okay. And then
when you have a really

604
00:30:26.190 --> 00:30:28.110
great experience, what you think,
Oh my, and then you

605
00:30:28.110 --> 00:30:29.820
look, you look around like,
Oh my goodness, did you

606
00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:35.370
see that? I will be
there? I know Mr. Robot

607
00:30:35.370 --> 00:30:38.580
is just really great hacker
show on USA. And it's,

608
00:30:38.790 --> 00:30:42.120
it has a lot of
really fully fleshed out characters.

609
00:30:42.120 --> 00:30:46.590
And there's one woman, who's
a hijabi, who's a hacker

610
00:30:46.980 --> 00:30:51.540
and she's not a terrorist.
Oh my God. Actual human

611
00:30:51.540 --> 00:30:54.030
being. She just happens to
be a hijabi. And she's

612
00:30:54.030 --> 00:30:57.270
part of the larger hacker
culture. And the hacker group

613
00:30:57.270 --> 00:30:59.940
is run by a woman.
So it looks like a

614
00:30:59.940 --> 00:31:03.270
bunch of our nerdy friends.
And That is awesome. I'm

615
00:31:03.270 --> 00:31:06.540
definitely interested in watching that.
And the best part about

616
00:31:06.540 --> 00:31:09.960
it is that all the
hacks they do are actually

617
00:31:09.960 --> 00:31:13.920
legit hacks. Like it's not
like scorpion. It's not like

618
00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.440
fake hacks. You see what
I'm saying? Like they want

619
00:31:16.440 --> 00:31:19.260
to figure out how to
break into a, a building

620
00:31:19.260 --> 00:31:22.560
and mess with the environmental
controls. So they actually code

621
00:31:22.560 --> 00:31:24.840
and create an raspberry PI
thing. And then they connect

622
00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:28.320
the raspberry PI. They connect
the raspberry PI to the

623
00:31:28.890 --> 00:31:31.650
environmental controls to bring the
temperature up to like burn

624
00:31:31.650 --> 00:31:35.070
the backups. Okay. That is
something I definitely have to

625
00:31:35.070 --> 00:31:37.710
see because one thing I've
seen in every movie that

626
00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.890
like has a hacker or
anything about computer science, it's

627
00:31:40.890 --> 00:31:43.860
never real actual coding or
computer science, but usually you're

628
00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:47.520
just like furiously typing and
then like something happens, Oh

629
00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:51.860
gosh. Or they have like
two keyboards. And like one

630
00:31:51.870 --> 00:31:54.420
guy is like moving his
hands up and down, typing

631
00:31:54.420 --> 00:31:57.060
on two keyboards. And then
there's that whole legendary scene

632
00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:59.880
from CSI where the girl
is like, I'm gonna make

633
00:31:59.880 --> 00:32:02.180
a gooey with visual basic
to track the bad guys.

634
00:32:03.510 --> 00:32:05.730
And you just, you, you
literally like hurt yourself face

635
00:32:05.730 --> 00:32:09.480
palming. I know. Cause it's
not realistic at all. That's

636
00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.800
that show sounds awesome. I'll
definitely go it. So that's

637
00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.470
the school you're going to
like mr. Robot. The best

638
00:32:13.470 --> 00:32:16.950
thing about mr. Robot is
that the titles are actually

639
00:32:16.950 --> 00:32:19.980
like the names of torrents.
So it's like the name

640
00:32:19.980 --> 00:32:23.100
of the show, like episode
zero is like called like

641
00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:27.180
view source.mq. Oh my gosh.
That is, that is Spread

642
00:32:27.180 --> 00:32:30.150
the word around, around into
it and around Dartmouth, I

643
00:32:30.150 --> 00:32:32.760
will, for sure. Very cool.
And we will keep spreading

644
00:32:32.760 --> 00:32:34.170
the word about some of
the great stuff that you're

645
00:32:34.170 --> 00:32:39.380
doing and people can find
you@kaiathomas.com I think, right. Don't

646
00:32:39.380 --> 00:32:43.660
you have that redirecting.info.info. And
that goes up to your

647
00:32:43.660 --> 00:32:47.500
GitHub page. And also congratulations
on being featured in a

648
00:32:47.500 --> 00:32:50.770
lot of news reports on
the recent meme. I look

649
00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:54.610
like an engineer. Oh, thank
you so much. This has

650
00:32:54.610 --> 00:32:57.640
been another episode of Hanselminutes
and we'll see you again

651
00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.150
next week.
