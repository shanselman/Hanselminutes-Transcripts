In this episode, Scott talks
with designer, Felix cork and

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:06.080
developer, Richard Griffin about working with
Zambia. Hi, this is Scott

10
00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:08.390
Hanselman, and this is another
episode of Hansel minutes. And

11
00:01:08.390 --> 00:01:13.130
I'm sitting down here with
Richard Griffin and Felix cork from

12
00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.960
contango. And Felix is a
designer and Richard, you are

13
00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:21.350
not, no, I'm not, but
you guys do a lot

14
00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:24.650
of WPF in the real
world. You're out there actually

15
00:01:24.650 --> 00:01:29.030
charging people money, doing this
as a business. Yeah. Yeah.

16
00:01:29.870 --> 00:01:34.310
We have paying customers that
pay for WPF apps and

17
00:01:34.310 --> 00:01:40.010
also silver light applications. It's
real world. We have clients

18
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.500
who, who shout when we
don't deliver and all the

19
00:01:44.510 --> 00:01:48.200
standard stuff that most people
go through. When, when they're

20
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.350
building apps for Now, I'm
starting to do WPF. And

21
00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:54.710
I have noticed that all
of my WPF applications are

22
00:01:54.710 --> 00:01:59.570
ugly. So I'm thinking that
maybe I'm missing something and

23
00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:04.610
that something might be a
designer at my side. Yeah.

24
00:02:05.390 --> 00:02:07.670
Well, the problem is, Hey,
you've got, is that a

25
00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:10.730
developers are used to doing
wind form application development. They

26
00:02:10.730 --> 00:02:13.190
don't realize that was AML.
They can put a really

27
00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:16.310
glossy sheen over it and
you know, they can make

28
00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.230
programs look as good as
they, as he want to

29
00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:20.900
be. Yeah. So some people
have said some of the

30
00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:22.670
naysayers have said that it's
kind of a myth that

31
00:02:22.670 --> 00:02:24.560
the idea that there'd be
this designer, that's going to

32
00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.690
go and generate all the
work with all those animal

33
00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:29.810
and make it wonderful. And
I think we're putting this

34
00:02:29.810 --> 00:02:31.940
in the, we as a.net,
developers are putting this in

35
00:02:31.940 --> 00:02:34.520
terms of wind forums. Cause
we visualize ourselves like, well,

36
00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:36.500
I guess the designer will
put the button on the

37
00:02:36.500 --> 00:02:39.860
form and I'll write the
code behind. And you know,

38
00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:42.680
that's, that's not reality, but
what is it about SAML

39
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.520
that makes this the separation
of concerns possible? Well, the

40
00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.550
good thing about XAML particularly
is that it's accessible to

41
00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:52.400
developers and designers. It's got
strengths for both. I mean,

42
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:58.280
for me, it's got vector
animations, styling, gradients, colors, shapes,

43
00:02:58.310 --> 00:03:00.160
all the good stuff that
would get in any traditional

44
00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:04.150
vector illustration application. And you've
got your timelines for animation

45
00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:08.020
and also it's for developers.
You've got real ability to

46
00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:10.240
get in there and it's
a very powerful language, more

47
00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:15.460
so than just markup. Yeah.
I, I mean, one of

48
00:03:15.460 --> 00:03:18.190
the things I love about
Samuel is that it's, it's,

49
00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.810
it's human readable. Yeah. And
it's highly tolerable. So it

50
00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:27.820
means that designers like Felix
don't necessarily have to crank

51
00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:30.220
tomb at sandal at the
moment. Yeah. You know, the

52
00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:32.860
tools aren't on as good
as what they can be.

53
00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:36.850
But you know, with, even
with a new release of

54
00:03:36.850 --> 00:03:41.470
blends, the June release of
blend, that team is seeing

55
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:45.670
some really great work, listening
to the community and putting

56
00:03:45.670 --> 00:03:47.920
in some great features. So
as those tools get better,

57
00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:51.570
designers won't need to look
at Samuel. So you said

58
00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:53.430
it was, it was human
readable. So I mean it's

59
00:03:53.430 --> 00:03:56.730
angle brackets, which you, as
a developer, I continue to

60
00:03:56.730 --> 00:03:58.410
remind folks which one of
you is the developer and

61
00:03:58.410 --> 00:04:00.120
which one is the designer
you as about you think

62
00:04:00.120 --> 00:04:01.650
that's a good thing that
you can see the ankle

63
00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:05.490
brackets. It's not just a
blob or a.foo file. And

64
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:07.500
it's, you can't look inside
it. You like that. It's

65
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:10.140
also texts. Yeah. Yeah. And
then what was the other

66
00:04:10.140 --> 00:04:13.800
word that you said, tell
us She is human readable

67
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:19.650
and Tool tool. Yeah. Yeah.
Sorry. That's my dodgy. No,

68
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.440
that's my, that's my dodgy
American accent. So I figured

69
00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.630
so it's, two-level in the
sense that there are tools

70
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:26.460
that can sit on top
of it. Yeah. That was

71
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:29.070
wanting to ask Felix, do
you care that it's angled

72
00:04:29.070 --> 00:04:32.730
brackets as a designer? Oh,
Because I've got as a

73
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:36.660
web designer, I've definitely got
experience of HTML CSS, and

74
00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.520
a lot of that you
can bring across. I mean,

75
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:41.070
it's very similar to the
way you do an HTML,

76
00:04:41.070 --> 00:04:44.460
Mark mocked up page, you
to do all your HTML

77
00:04:44.730 --> 00:04:46.920
and then have an external
CSS file to do the

78
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:49.710
stylings. So this is very
much the same with resource

79
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:53.340
dictionaries. And so, yeah, there's
a lot of commonality When

80
00:04:53.340 --> 00:04:55.260
you sat down for the
first time like that, the

81
00:04:55.260 --> 00:04:57.630
day that you saw XAML
for the first time, did

82
00:04:57.630 --> 00:05:01.080
you look and say, Oh,
that's HTML, but for richer

83
00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:04.650
applications, I am fired up
blend. And then I started

84
00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.760
playing around with the bringing
in images, trying to animate

85
00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.210
things, following the tutorials, trying
to add colors and shapes

86
00:05:12.210 --> 00:05:14.550
and what have you and
controls. And then you would

87
00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:18.120
flip over into the split
view and then you can

88
00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.890
see what it's there. And
then that was really interesting

89
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.560
because it's kind of like
flash, except you can get

90
00:05:22.560 --> 00:05:24.210
under the hood of it
and really sort of play

91
00:05:24.210 --> 00:05:28.050
around in a really edited,
a very small level. Is

92
00:05:28.050 --> 00:05:30.240
that a strength? I mean,
I did some flash work

93
00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.550
when they work, when was
called future wave, which was

94
00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.230
many, many, many years ago.
I don't know if you've

95
00:05:34.230 --> 00:05:36.090
ever just before I was
born really just before you

96
00:05:36.090 --> 00:05:39.960
were born. Yeah. Okay. I'm
old. And I mean, the

97
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.490
tool is in your way
sometimes. Yeah, definitely. I do.

98
00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:45.690
You haven't got the, yeah,
it's so good. I mean,

99
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:48.180
it's given an example of
a mini field. If you've

100
00:05:48.180 --> 00:05:51.300
got an object in your,
on your scene, that's a

101
00:05:51.630 --> 00:05:53.430
pixel out. I mean, you
can have, you can zoom

102
00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:55.140
in and move it around.
We can flip it over

103
00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:58.040
to code and then delete
the one digit it's it's

104
00:05:58.040 --> 00:05:59.630
whatever works best for you.
But it's, I find it

105
00:05:59.630 --> 00:06:01.520
much faster to work like
that. And you find yourself

106
00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:03.590
doing that a lot, a
lot. In fact, the more

107
00:06:03.590 --> 00:06:05.900
I use blend, the more,
the more you have to

108
00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:07.550
get into the code and
do it yourself anyway, because

109
00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:11.780
it's not entirely a hundred
percent perfect. And it's the

110
00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:13.850
same way as you can
use Dreamweaver or expression and

111
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:17.960
web to visually design webpages.
It's, after a while you

112
00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:19.610
find a lot more efficient
and a lot quicker just

113
00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:21.830
to go in there and
edit it yourself in the

114
00:06:21.830 --> 00:06:24.170
code. And it's not actually
that scary. It's very similar.

115
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.290
There's a lot more proprietary
attributes and tags to get

116
00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:30.350
your head around. And a
lot of different ways of

117
00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:32.650
thinking. I wonder if this
was a lot like a

118
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:36.520
again, before you were born
in 1991, when people were

119
00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.610
doing areas TML, they started,
you know, like the hardest

120
00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.350
thing that you could do
when we were all learning

121
00:06:41.350 --> 00:06:44.200
HTML at the birth of
the web was tables. I

122
00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:47.230
mean, literally this was like,
Oh my God tables, T

123
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:50.350
R T will slow down.
So we would use front

124
00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:53.530
page to make a table.
And then you would flip

125
00:06:53.530 --> 00:06:56.470
over, but after a while,
the whole community matured, and

126
00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:58.720
now you just, you know,
call span, roast band. We

127
00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.940
know this stuff in our
heads, we can bang this

128
00:07:00.940 --> 00:07:03.310
out. A notepad is the
same thing gonna happen with

129
00:07:03.310 --> 00:07:06.100
XAML that we're going to
use the blend and use

130
00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:08.320
the designers out of visual
studio. And then eventually we'll

131
00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:11.170
just all get it. And
we'll care less about these

132
00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:14.290
visual designers Very much. That's
exactly what's going to happen.

133
00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:17.890
But blend is really, really
necessary for taking those first

134
00:07:17.890 --> 00:07:20.170
steps. I mean, it's, you
can't just sit there and

135
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:22.570
start writing out, cranking out
them or without, I mean,

136
00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:25.330
no one new one can
just develop a book about

137
00:07:25.330 --> 00:07:27.580
it and then sit down
and write it straight out.

138
00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:30.120
But, and there's a really,
really good helping hand, especially

139
00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.350
the split. It really is
powerful. Yeah. I mean, from

140
00:07:35.350 --> 00:07:39.520
a developer's perspective, I'm doing
WPF and silver light. You've

141
00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:44.080
got to learn land. It's
a great starting point. When,

142
00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.950
when do you want to
build a UI control? Hey,

143
00:07:48.190 --> 00:07:50.590
I start in blend. I
don't start in visual studio

144
00:07:50.590 --> 00:07:55.060
because the cider surface itself,
Gender being the code name

145
00:07:55.060 --> 00:07:59.380
for the visual studio. Yeah,
yeah. Designer. Yeah. That's just

146
00:07:59.380 --> 00:08:02.800
not really up to the
job. Let me ask you

147
00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:05.380
this though. Why is it
good? That blend is separate.

148
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.390
I mean, as a visual
studio person, you're the developer.

149
00:08:07.390 --> 00:08:09.100
Do you wish that Glen
was inside of it? Yeah.

150
00:08:09.460 --> 00:08:12.310
Yeah. Yeah. I just want
one tool. You want one

151
00:08:12.310 --> 00:08:15.640
tool? You want the same
quality that Felix was shaking

152
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:18.280
his head though. It may
be good for you to

153
00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:21.340
have one too. I mean,
coming from a designer's perspective,

154
00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.190
I find that no visual
studio is complicated enough sort

155
00:08:24.190 --> 00:08:27.700
of application with too many
applications and parts to it.

156
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:30.160
And to separate for a
designer. Obviously it'd be great

157
00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:32.650
to have the, some of
the editors, the abilities to

158
00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.930
edit as I'm a win
in visual studio, because you're

159
00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:37.300
a, what do you call
it? The, the display sucks

160
00:08:37.300 --> 00:08:40.360
in a visual studio. You
can't see anything of any

161
00:08:41.150 --> 00:08:45.610
substance. So yeah, to make
that kind of clearer, what

162
00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:48.430
I'd actually like in visual
studio is to say, Hey,

163
00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.810
I'm a, I'm a creative
developer doing WPF. There's some

164
00:08:52.810 --> 00:08:56.760
sort of option there and
I can select option and

165
00:08:58.320 --> 00:09:02.520
It load up the surface
designer that I want to

166
00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:04.700
use for that particular job.
Do you want to be

167
00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:08.360
able to register, register XAML
editor with visual studio? And

168
00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.450
similarly, if I'm a designer,
then I should be able

169
00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:13.550
to fire up the tool
and say, Hey, I'm a

170
00:09:13.550 --> 00:09:18.050
designer doing Silverlight and it
will load up a reduced

171
00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:21.460
set of tooling to make
that easier. Having tilt two

172
00:09:21.460 --> 00:09:25.160
tools means that I have
to have to learn a

173
00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:29.030
new tool, but saying that
learning blend is really quite

174
00:09:29.030 --> 00:09:32.990
cool in terms of it's
a great meeting place for

175
00:09:33.170 --> 00:09:36.140
the developer and the designer.
You don't know anything neither

176
00:09:36.140 --> 00:09:40.160
of, you know, anything about
blend. So it's kind of,

177
00:09:40.370 --> 00:09:43.550
it's, it's a good place
to start building that relationship

178
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:46.880
because you're both in the
same boat. I think that

179
00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:51.680
designers though are more used
to having six, 12, 20

180
00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:54.980
different tools that they call
on. And they're not at

181
00:09:54.980 --> 00:09:58.590
all uncomfortable with having that,
you know, that group and

182
00:09:58.790 --> 00:10:00.680
explore in there and on
their Mac or it's like,

183
00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.410
well, here are the, here's
my tool kit. Well, my

184
00:10:03.710 --> 00:10:06.020
developers are getting more used
to having visual studio be

185
00:10:06.020 --> 00:10:10.160
the kitchen sink. Yeah. So
as a daily routine, it

186
00:10:10.170 --> 00:10:15.200
is, you tend to have
illustrator, Photoshop, Dreamweaver, Acrobat, your

187
00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:18.840
web browsers, flush all these
applications open at once. So

188
00:10:18.840 --> 00:10:21.260
with no real change of
perspective, I know developers only

189
00:10:21.260 --> 00:10:23.720
live in one world and
another mode of visual studio,

190
00:10:23.750 --> 00:10:29.600
but yeah. Yeah. I agree
with Felix that as a

191
00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:31.700
dev, you know, we've been
using visual studio, it's our

192
00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:34.460
home for the last kind
of five, six years and

193
00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.720
stuff. But the two, the
two tools that I have,

194
00:10:38.720 --> 00:10:40.520
well, the three tools that
I have when I'm, when

195
00:10:40.520 --> 00:10:43.280
I'm doing WPF and Silverlight
is, is visual studio. Cause

196
00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:46.430
Hey, you know, we use
visual studio pretty much. That's

197
00:10:46.430 --> 00:10:52.310
where we live blend to
do my UI pieces. And

198
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:56.330
what, what tends to happen
is that I'll build the

199
00:10:56.330 --> 00:10:59.600
UI and, and blend. And
then when I actually wants

200
00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:02.780
to go and crank the
XAML by hand, that's where

201
00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:04.640
blends sort of falls over
a little bit. So that's

202
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.580
when I move into visual
studio, it's got contact sensitive,

203
00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:09.980
help. I can deal with
that. I can build it.

204
00:11:10.430 --> 00:11:13.310
I can find that the
errors and all those sorts

205
00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:15.650
of things that we know
and love real easy inside

206
00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:18.140
of visual studio. The other
tool that I use a

207
00:11:18.140 --> 00:11:21.740
lot is cause animal, which
is Robbie, Robbie, and Brexton's

208
00:11:23.090 --> 00:11:26.390
kind of little baby, which
is, which is up on,

209
00:11:26.480 --> 00:11:31.880
on code coat Plex. <inaudible>
K a X, a M

210
00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:34.490
L. And you can search
for that and you'll pick

211
00:11:34.490 --> 00:11:37.280
it up. So it's a
little XAML editor, but it's

212
00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:39.650
a split screen. It's got
all sorts of things like

213
00:11:39.650 --> 00:11:42.710
IntelliSense and whatnot. Yeah. For,
for banging out little, little

214
00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:46.220
samples. But I'm hearing from
you, Richard, that you're more

215
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:49.340
likely to have a, you
know, one foot squarely in

216
00:11:49.340 --> 00:11:51.650
visual studio and then you
occasionally bring a foot into

217
00:11:51.650 --> 00:11:54.760
the blend, but I'm hearing
Felix that he would never

218
00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:59.520
open visual studio unless forced.
That's definitely not the case.

219
00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:01.260
It used to be when
I first started doing it.

220
00:12:01.260 --> 00:12:04.860
But now it comes really,
really apparent really quickly that

221
00:12:04.860 --> 00:12:07.340
you have to have visual
studio it's as a designer.

222
00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:08.850
It's one of the things
I tell everyone who is

223
00:12:08.850 --> 00:12:12.390
starting out in Silverlight and
a WPF, cause it's a

224
00:12:12.390 --> 00:12:15.480
totally alien environment to work
in the designers. I'd never,

225
00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:18.870
I see that over shoulders
before I started doing WPF,

226
00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:21.660
but I'd never ever installed
it, used it, or even

227
00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:23.430
really knew what it did.
And is that because of

228
00:12:23.430 --> 00:12:26.680
some thing in blend, some
falling down in blend, I

229
00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:28.440
assume, what is it in
blend is not doing that

230
00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:31.860
would let you avoid using
noodle studio. Okay. There's probably

231
00:12:31.860 --> 00:12:34.380
three main things. I use
visual studio for that. You

232
00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.140
have to use visual studio
for one, you've got a

233
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:39.480
site-wide search and replace, which
you haven't got in blend,

234
00:12:39.630 --> 00:12:42.540
which is, you know, paramount
for replacing brushes or styles

235
00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:45.000
or that kind of thing.
The second one is TFS

236
00:12:45.090 --> 00:12:47.340
and that's when you're working
collaboratively, which you have to

237
00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:50.220
be the developer, you've got
to have source control. You

238
00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.410
got to be able to
roll back. When I destroyed

239
00:12:52.410 --> 00:12:53.610
a program, I've got to
be able to roll back

240
00:12:53.610 --> 00:12:57.930
to when it's, when it
was stable and also the,

241
00:12:58.860 --> 00:13:03.770
Oh, the third thing is
it for, you can remember

242
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:07.230
just two things. So, so
I'm hearing source control support

243
00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:10.410
directly in blend. And In
a sense, as Richard mentioned

244
00:13:10.470 --> 00:13:13.440
previously is IntelliSense, which you
know, because you do find

245
00:13:13.440 --> 00:13:16.320
yourself writing more and more
code. I find more XAML

246
00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.920
when you become more professional
with it, <inaudible> June release.

247
00:13:19.930 --> 00:13:22.740
Doesn't have IntelliSense in the
book. Nope. It's called a

248
00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:25.620
very, very shockingly awful code
editor. I hate to say

249
00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:27.990
it, but it just doesn't
really, it's good for it's

250
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:32.040
really for tweaking for no
way of writing. So what

251
00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:33.630
doesn't sound so bad when
you say it in an

252
00:13:33.630 --> 00:13:37.080
English accent, but still shockingly
awful is shockingly awful. Their

253
00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:42.060
chat is shockingly awful. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman with

254
00:13:42.060 --> 00:13:44.040
a word from our sponsor.
Do you know how to

255
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:48.210
build web 2.0 Ajax applications
with web 1.0 components? You

256
00:13:48.210 --> 00:13:49.940
really can't. If you want
to do the next generation

257
00:13:49.960 --> 00:13:53.460
web applications you'll need next
generation components. Just like the

258
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:55.650
ones that our friends at
Telerik have got their rad

259
00:13:55.650 --> 00:13:58.650
controls for ESPN at Ajax.
It's a huge pack of

260
00:13:58.650 --> 00:14:02.550
web controls built on top
of asp.net. Ajax. That'll add

261
00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:06.600
previously impossible performance interactivity to
your next project. The new

262
00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:10.800
controls mirror, the Ajax API
from asp.net. So development is

263
00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:14.220
really straightforward. The client scripts
are shared. So loading time

264
00:14:14.220 --> 00:14:16.380
is not a problem. If
you just set a couple

265
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:18.420
of properties and you'll be
able to automatically bind a

266
00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:22.170
web services for a really
efficient operation, the new rad

267
00:14:22.170 --> 00:14:25.830
editor from ESPN Ajax, Telerik
loads up to four times

268
00:14:25.830 --> 00:14:28.920
faster than before. And the
new rad grid handles thousands

269
00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.830
of records and just milliseconds,
but as always, it's best

270
00:14:31.830 --> 00:14:34.830
to try for yourself. So
you can visit <inaudible> dot

271
00:14:34.830 --> 00:14:38.310
com slash ASP, net Ajax,
and download a trial. Thanks

272
00:14:38.310 --> 00:14:41.190
a lot. So what is
your standard workflow? If you're

273
00:14:41.190 --> 00:14:43.290
going to sit down and
make an application tomorrow, something,

274
00:14:43.320 --> 00:14:45.210
you know, something trivial. If
you're going to go write

275
00:14:45.270 --> 00:14:50.490
a baby smash, where would
you start? What's the workflow?

276
00:14:50.490 --> 00:14:53.810
Like, did he just say
Again, you can't say things

277
00:14:53.810 --> 00:14:56.440
like that And baby smashed
before you read it last

278
00:14:56.440 --> 00:14:59.800
night, I could design it.
You could design it. So

279
00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:01.720
what's the workflow like amp
at this game. You know,

280
00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:04.030
I want babies to play
with it. There's there's interaction

281
00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:07.900
of course, but ultimately right
now my shapes look like,

282
00:15:08.410 --> 00:15:10.450
well, they're ugly, cause I'm
not a designer, but just

283
00:15:10.450 --> 00:15:12.820
use that as an example,
what's the workflow you sit

284
00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.960
down and we've caught the
concept. Now what, So pretty

285
00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:21.250
much where we start is
that I'll kind of kick

286
00:15:21.250 --> 00:15:24.010
things off by, by setting
up the project. So quite

287
00:15:24.010 --> 00:15:27.490
the solution, quite the projects
inside that solution just as

288
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:30.400
you do. And you're, you
know, as you doing at

289
00:15:30.400 --> 00:15:32.500
the moment, more than likely,
I'm much more qualified to

290
00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:38.710
go file new project than
Felix is. Well, maybe If

291
00:15:38.710 --> 00:15:40.480
you do find a new
food blend, you don't get

292
00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:42.670
the same kind of setup
and solution. It's not quite

293
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:45.400
as complete. I believe Really.
So if you file new

294
00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:48.100
project on an implant is
a different, you finally project

295
00:15:48.110 --> 00:15:52.030
the individual studio. It sounds
like if that's the case,

296
00:15:52.030 --> 00:15:55.480
that's a problem. Yeah. I
think that's the case. There

297
00:15:55.480 --> 00:16:02.350
are definitely a differences between
when you're creating, when you're

298
00:16:02.350 --> 00:16:04.960
creating assets and blend and
comparisons, when you create new

299
00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.960
visual studio, which the templates
don't necessarily line up. Exactly.

300
00:16:08.150 --> 00:16:12.910
Yeah. You can't drop the
hair. There isn't a web.

301
00:16:13.090 --> 00:16:15.940
There isn't a web file.
You can't just, you don't

302
00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.550
get an index HTML generated
for you. You have to

303
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.920
go through, add it to
another solution in visual studio.

304
00:16:20.920 --> 00:16:23.770
So I can create a
Silverlight project. I can't open

305
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.510
up the folder and running
the thing like entrepreneur web

306
00:16:25.510 --> 00:16:29.050
browser. Oh, interesting. So I
th I think what we

307
00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:30.790
did with that was we
just kind of opened it

308
00:16:30.790 --> 00:16:34.120
up and visual studio and
did the pre compiled web

309
00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:38.340
thing built that in release
and pushed that out. And

310
00:16:38.350 --> 00:16:40.480
Felix put that up on
the, So you make the

311
00:16:40.480 --> 00:16:42.760
new project and now you've
got it and that's checked

312
00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:44.800
into source control. So Felix
can get to it. And

313
00:16:44.860 --> 00:16:48.370
that way Yep. So what
we're turning to do there

314
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:52.090
is use a kind of
model view presenter style Pason

315
00:16:52.090 --> 00:16:55.060
because it NWTF, and Silverlight,
it's all about the data.

316
00:16:55.120 --> 00:16:56.860
If you get your, if
you get your data model

317
00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.420
right, then everything's good. Everything's
cool. If, if you get

318
00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:05.050
it wrong then, because data
Barney's is so powerful in

319
00:17:05.050 --> 00:17:08.080
WPF, you can really sort
of not take full advantage

320
00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:10.870
of, of data binding. And
that's kind of something we,

321
00:17:10.930 --> 00:17:13.720
we saw in the, in
the baby smash was that,

322
00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:17.050
you know, you could be
using data binding a lot.

323
00:17:17.050 --> 00:17:20.320
You could be taking advantage
of that power. So once

324
00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:23.980
that's kind of done and
everything's checked into to TFS

325
00:17:23.980 --> 00:17:27.940
or whatever source control management
system, you're using it's time

326
00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:31.360
for the designer, Felix, to,
to start doing his school

327
00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:35.530
stuff on top. Yeah. So
once the project is all

328
00:17:35.530 --> 00:17:37.900
set up and Northern TFS
and all available to me,

329
00:17:38.170 --> 00:17:41.110
I'll open up the CS
project and blend and I'll,

330
00:17:41.950 --> 00:17:44.920
I'll have one monitor. Normally
I'll take the Photoshop mock-up

331
00:17:44.920 --> 00:17:47.770
or the illustrator mock-up and
then I'll with blend and

332
00:17:47.770 --> 00:17:50.130
the other window I'll start
laying it out. I'll lay

333
00:17:50.130 --> 00:17:52.680
out the grid structure to
start with. So I've got

334
00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:55.470
loud in place. I can
start dropping in assets that

335
00:17:55.470 --> 00:18:01.440
I've exported from illustrator using
the Mike Swanson plugin. And I'll

336
00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:03.630
take that all those, the
vector or the vector goodness,

337
00:18:03.630 --> 00:18:05.370
and all the bitmaps and
I'll start laying them out

338
00:18:05.490 --> 00:18:07.790
and doing the basic sort
of controls. So your mock-up

339
00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:09.860
might be in Photoshop or
in a paint program. It's

340
00:18:09.860 --> 00:18:12.050
an illustrator, but blend isn't
to the point where you're

341
00:18:12.050 --> 00:18:14.780
going to go and do
your mockups in there. Oh,

342
00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:17.930
no, no way. It's not
mature enough as an application

343
00:18:17.930 --> 00:18:22.910
competitor, Photoshop and illustrator. I
mean, it's, it's very, it's

344
00:18:22.910 --> 00:18:25.550
got mean you can draw
rectangles and ellipses and some

345
00:18:25.550 --> 00:18:28.370
sort of path tool, but
it's really, really, especially when

346
00:18:28.370 --> 00:18:31.670
you're experienced as a designer
and every designer knows Photoshop

347
00:18:31.670 --> 00:18:34.340
and illustrator inside out. The
tool that you're referring to

348
00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:37.430
is the XAML export tool
from Mike Swanson, which was been

349
00:18:37.430 --> 00:18:39.200
a very, very long time
ago. Yeah. It's been great.

350
00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:42.080
Ever since I first learned
to BPF, which a couple

351
00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.910
of two or three years
ago, that tool has been

352
00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:46.700
a illustrator plugin has been
available to me and I

353
00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:48.800
use it I'd say daily,
But it hasn't been a

354
00:18:48.800 --> 00:18:53.300
rev since 2004 is unbelievable.
It's such a vital tool.

355
00:18:53.390 --> 00:18:57.080
And really, if it was
gone, what would happen I'd

356
00:18:57.080 --> 00:19:00.620
might have to start using
expression design, which would be

357
00:19:00.620 --> 00:19:03.170
a terrible shame because it's
not nearly as clean or

358
00:19:03.170 --> 00:19:05.990
as useful Illustrator plug it.
They use illustrator exports, a

359
00:19:05.990 --> 00:19:08.480
fundamental part of your workflow.
Okay. So now you've created

360
00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:11.570
your XAML and you've got
him off making it prettier

361
00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.080
while I assume simultaneously you're
working on the interactions, the,

362
00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:19.850
the mouse down events and
all. No, not really. One

363
00:19:19.850 --> 00:19:21.170
of the things I want
to just pick up on

364
00:19:21.170 --> 00:19:23.180
very quickly before we kind
of move on with the

365
00:19:23.180 --> 00:19:26.240
rest of the workflow is
that as, as Felix has

366
00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.850
just said, you know, designers
inherently know how to do

367
00:19:28.850 --> 00:19:32.900
vector graphics. So don't do
bit flatbed maps anymore by

368
00:19:32.900 --> 00:19:37.850
doing, by doing vector graphics,
you know, instantly we can

369
00:19:37.850 --> 00:19:41.540
have something that, that looks
pretty similar to those flat

370
00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:45.200
PSDs because we have, we
can just import those vector

371
00:19:45.200 --> 00:19:47.300
graphics, then you know what
clients are like, you know,

372
00:19:47.660 --> 00:19:50.180
you, as soon as you've
got a cool looking background,

373
00:19:50.180 --> 00:19:52.700
they think that the, the
apps kind of finished and

374
00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:55.400
built. So yeah, it's, it's
a really great sort of

375
00:19:55.550 --> 00:19:59.180
productive way of building your
application. So you're saying, Bringing

376
00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:01.130
in P and G bitmaps
of any kind that is

377
00:20:01.130 --> 00:20:04.130
just anathema to what you're
trying to accomplish in WPF

378
00:20:05.570 --> 00:20:08.130
Sometimes. Yes and no. I
mean, obviously they don't scale

379
00:20:08.130 --> 00:20:11.240
all, then they're not resolution
independent. So they, they are,

380
00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.420
there can be a bit
of a curse, but also

381
00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:16.130
you, you have to use
them. You have to use

382
00:20:16.130 --> 00:20:17.810
them. I mean, if you're
going to do small icons,

383
00:20:17.870 --> 00:20:21.050
I find the anti-aliasing is
very strong and WPF and

384
00:20:21.050 --> 00:20:24.890
it can blur the lines.
And also for when using

385
00:20:24.890 --> 00:20:28.670
bitmap effects, I tend to
use alpha transparent PNGs for

386
00:20:28.670 --> 00:20:32.300
drop shadows and glows. Cause
it's very CPU inexpensive, so

387
00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:35.090
you have to use them.
But yeah, ideally use back

388
00:20:35.090 --> 00:20:38.060
to when you can sort
of This part though, vectors

389
00:20:38.060 --> 00:20:39.890
a year, that's there, your
heavy lifting should be done

390
00:20:39.890 --> 00:20:44.450
in Victor. Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.
Alright. So once we've got

391
00:20:44.450 --> 00:20:46.910
this point, we've got the
project set up, we've got

392
00:20:47.290 --> 00:20:50.710
some layout now. So we've
kind of got the basic

393
00:20:50.710 --> 00:20:53.800
skeleton in the UI of
how this, how this app's

394
00:20:54.460 --> 00:20:57.690
going to look. The next
stage really is, is, is

395
00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:00.700
data. So we need to
get that, that data from

396
00:21:00.700 --> 00:21:03.460
the data model up and
into the UI. So my

397
00:21:03.460 --> 00:21:06.430
next job really is, is
all about data binding and

398
00:21:06.430 --> 00:21:12.430
building those data templates in
XAML, I'm ready for Felix

399
00:21:12.430 --> 00:21:15.690
to start styling that data
that's coming through. Now, You

400
00:21:15.690 --> 00:21:18.570
give him a basic data.
How do you give him,

401
00:21:18.570 --> 00:21:20.580
you know, data? You don't
necessarily have him hooking up

402
00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:22.470
to a database. You might
want to just give him

403
00:21:22.470 --> 00:21:25.410
some sample data. How do
you give him that? So,

404
00:21:26.430 --> 00:21:29.760
you know, when you're building
projects that the database guys

405
00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:32.550
or, or, or this service
kind of the guys that

406
00:21:32.550 --> 00:21:35.760
are programming that backend side
of things, whether that's SOA

407
00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:40.050
or, or some sort of
data access layer, they haven't

408
00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.420
got any data ready for
you to wire straight up

409
00:21:42.420 --> 00:21:45.390
to. So what, what we
tend to do is we

410
00:21:45.390 --> 00:21:49.380
tend to just create some
simple XML data islands inside

411
00:21:49.380 --> 00:21:53.610
of the XAML. And those
kinds of look the same

412
00:21:53.610 --> 00:21:55.380
sort of shape as a
D as the data that

413
00:21:55.380 --> 00:21:58.350
we're expecting from the, from
the data access, layers, low

414
00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:02.430
down Properties line up appropriately,
even though it's something entirely

415
00:22:02.430 --> 00:22:04.770
different than what will eventually
be used. Yeah. Because the

416
00:22:04.770 --> 00:22:07.680
data binding expressions are, are
just strings, right? So you

417
00:22:07.680 --> 00:22:09.390
can say, I want to
refer to first name and

418
00:22:09.390 --> 00:22:11.830
last name, and whether that's
from an XML Islander from

419
00:22:11.830 --> 00:22:14.550
a, an object, it doesn't
matter. Sure. So you can,

420
00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.150
you can just swap those
strength, swipe straight out and,

421
00:22:18.750 --> 00:22:22.260
you know, change a bit
of the XAML and write

422
00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:24.810
some code to, to bind
up to the data context.

423
00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:27.330
And Hey, it's so long
as that, as long as

424
00:22:27.330 --> 00:22:31.350
those properties are existing on
your business objects, then there's

425
00:22:31.350 --> 00:22:34.260
no, there's no sense to
recharge Binding the bridge that

426
00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:37.350
keeps the designer and the
developer, you know, together. Is

427
00:22:37.350 --> 00:22:40.620
that the, is it the
interstitial tissue? Yes. Well, a

428
00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:43.380
huge part of my world
really. I mean, I mostly

429
00:22:44.340 --> 00:22:46.260
leave that to the experts.
I mean, it's great to

430
00:22:46.260 --> 00:22:48.210
have it there and I
can sort of totally that,

431
00:22:48.270 --> 00:22:52.350
but realistically, it's, I'm dealing
with the way that the

432
00:22:52.350 --> 00:22:54.600
data is presented rather than
getting the data in there.

433
00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:56.800
So, you know, as soon
as the techs come in

434
00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:59.190
to the application, I can
start it I'd change them,

435
00:22:59.370 --> 00:23:01.560
how it's going to look,
but really as Richard's world,

436
00:23:01.630 --> 00:23:04.110
the developer world, is that
what you're doing? We'll give

437
00:23:04.110 --> 00:23:06.000
them a sample in Jamel
and you'll say, well, you

438
00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.610
know, see all these squares
and align with people's names

439
00:23:08.610 --> 00:23:11.040
in them. That's pretty much
how it should look except

440
00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:15.120
make it wonderful. Yeah. Yeah,
pretty much. So my world

441
00:23:15.120 --> 00:23:17.670
is, is pretty similar to,
to the world, which has

442
00:23:17.670 --> 00:23:23.580
always lived in with regards
to me, going and chatting

443
00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:27.000
with other geeks and finding
out, you know, what C-sharp

444
00:23:27.030 --> 00:23:28.740
w do we need to
use? What are the, what

445
00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.410
are the patterns we need
to use and, and understanding

446
00:23:31.410 --> 00:23:34.590
what the developers low down
in the level in those

447
00:23:34.590 --> 00:23:38.610
layers that we have want.
And then kind of translating

448
00:23:38.610 --> 00:23:44.400
that geeky dev talk into
something that Felix can understand

449
00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:47.870
so that we can work
out together, how, you know,

450
00:23:47.870 --> 00:23:50.120
this is the data that
we're getting through, is it

451
00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.190
the right type of data
and how we bend that

452
00:23:52.190 --> 00:23:55.070
data and then the XAML
and the C sharp to

453
00:23:55.070 --> 00:23:58.040
make sure that we build
something that, that looks great.

454
00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:01.420
And it's great. And is
this a fundamentally different way

455
00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:04.360
from working with a designer
on a webpage or doing

456
00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.570
CSS and HTML and, you
know, kind of standard web

457
00:24:07.570 --> 00:24:09.730
2.0 div type stuff is
XAML and the way that

458
00:24:09.730 --> 00:24:11.500
that works and the way
that you interact with a

459
00:24:11.500 --> 00:24:17.440
designer fundamentally different, or is
it very similar? Well, yes,

460
00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.930
it's different, but it really
depends how you're working at

461
00:24:19.930 --> 00:24:22.300
the moment. If you're working
in a, in a very

462
00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.450
agile, scrum based approach, XP
type approach, then it's highly

463
00:24:28.450 --> 00:24:32.860
possible that developers are already
working with designers. But in

464
00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.730
the most part, what we
see is that designers build

465
00:24:37.210 --> 00:24:40.660
in Photoshop. And then basically
once that's done, it's kind

466
00:24:40.660 --> 00:24:42.880
of Chuck it over the
wall and that dev spec

467
00:24:42.880 --> 00:24:45.130
it up. And it's kind
of how do we build

468
00:24:45.130 --> 00:24:49.300
this in this technology? So
we kind of take, take

469
00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:53.980
baby steps together. And for
each kind of little, couple

470
00:24:53.980 --> 00:24:56.650
of steps that we take,
we're feeding back with one

471
00:24:56.650 --> 00:25:00.670
another to make sure that
the technology can bend in

472
00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:03.370
the way that we want
it to bend. And obviously

473
00:25:03.370 --> 00:25:06.520
if it doesn't, then we
might buy that that might

474
00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.910
be a performance issue. So
we pick up those issues

475
00:25:09.910 --> 00:25:14.110
a lot quicker rather than
the traditional approach, which is

476
00:25:14.110 --> 00:25:19.120
maybe Felix doing all the
design and then handing that

477
00:25:19.120 --> 00:25:21.700
over, ready for me to
do my data. So it's

478
00:25:21.700 --> 00:25:24.100
not a thing where Felix
works for weeks and weeks

479
00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:26.470
and comes up with the
grand, the grand XAML and

480
00:25:26.470 --> 00:25:29.350
then hands it to you.
It is a constant collaboration.

481
00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:34.300
Yeah, yeah, definitely. It has.
It absolutely has to be

482
00:25:35.110 --> 00:25:40.120
that way we believe. And
the consequence of that is,

483
00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.090
you know, and I'm still
amazed by this with WPF

484
00:25:43.090 --> 00:25:47.470
and Silverlight how quickly we
can build great looking apps

485
00:25:47.770 --> 00:25:52.780
using this kind of really
collaborative, iterative way of working.

486
00:25:53.410 --> 00:25:56.680
It means, you know, the
apps that we're we're giving

487
00:25:56.680 --> 00:25:59.680
away. Well, you know, we
built those in a couple

488
00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:03.640
of days. If we were
to build those in asp.net

489
00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:09.040
with standard web technologies, then
you know, that would take

490
00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.110
a lot longer for us
to do that. The learning

491
00:26:11.110 --> 00:26:13.300
curve though, I mean, I'm
two weeks, three weeks into

492
00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.910
WPF, and I'm still trying
to get shapes on the

493
00:26:15.910 --> 00:26:18.640
screen for babies while you're
telling me you're putting together

494
00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:21.310
data, you know, data bound
applications in three days that

495
00:26:21.310 --> 00:26:24.220
are gorgeous. So not only
do I not have the

496
00:26:24.220 --> 00:26:28.720
designer in my pocket, but
I'm obviously still going up

497
00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.430
the learning curve Hill. Sure.
I think that, I think

498
00:26:33.430 --> 00:26:35.110
the big problem that you
have at the moment with,

499
00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:37.480
with baby smash is that
you don't have any designers

500
00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:40.300
on board. So for you
designers that are out there,

501
00:26:41.130 --> 00:26:44.580
if you, if, if you
want to check out, you

502
00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:47.790
know, Scott COVID and the
rest of the developers that

503
00:26:47.790 --> 00:26:50.250
there could really do with
some, some help, I think

504
00:26:50.250 --> 00:26:53.960
with regards to making something
look really, really cool, Because

505
00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:55.880
if we don't solve this
baby smash problem, I don't

506
00:26:55.880 --> 00:26:58.220
know what the history, you
know, the future of VPF

507
00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:00.740
is going to be. Yeah.
Yeah. It will be over

508
00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:03.740
for WPF if you don't
get the baby smash Learning

509
00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:05.450
curve. I mean, how, how
hard was this for? When,

510
00:27:05.470 --> 00:27:06.950
when did it click for
you and then what, you

511
00:27:06.950 --> 00:27:08.630
know, how, how much harder
am I gonna have to

512
00:27:08.630 --> 00:27:10.820
pound my head against the
wall before the snap? So

513
00:27:10.850 --> 00:27:16.190
I think with, with XAML
XAML based technologies, the concepts

514
00:27:16.190 --> 00:27:18.350
are really cool. Yeah. So
we get the concept. Yeah,

515
00:27:18.950 --> 00:27:20.480
Yeah. I get it. Now
I will tell you this,

516
00:27:20.480 --> 00:27:23.450
I get the concepts that
took about two days, and

517
00:27:23.450 --> 00:27:25.040
now I see how data
binding a work in, and

518
00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:27.020
now that I've had some
really great refractors from the

519
00:27:27.020 --> 00:27:29.670
community, I'm starting to get
that. Yeah. Now that the

520
00:27:29.690 --> 00:27:33.980
depth of it is, is
I'm drowning. Sure. There's 18

521
00:27:33.980 --> 00:27:36.560
ways to do the exact
same thing. One of them

522
00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:41.870
is right. So the learning
curve is steep. I think

523
00:27:41.870 --> 00:27:44.900
the initial concepts, we, we
can grow really quickly and

524
00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.600
kind of say, yeah, that's,
that's better than what's come

525
00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:52.220
before, but it's actually writing
that code that XAML, which,

526
00:27:52.610 --> 00:27:57.230
you know, can, can be
very painful at times. One

527
00:27:57.230 --> 00:27:59.840
of the things that that
kind of helped me was,

528
00:27:59.870 --> 00:28:03.590
was cause I'm, you know,
just playing with, with <inaudible>

529
00:28:03.590 --> 00:28:06.800
and being able to write
XAML and in a way,

530
00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:10.550
which you know, is really
playing really poking what's what

531
00:28:10.550 --> 00:28:14.990
can be done rather than
starting with blend and blend,

532
00:28:14.990 --> 00:28:18.080
creating lots and lots of
XAML. And, and you're not

533
00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:21.200
really knowing what's going on
under the covers. But one

534
00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:22.820
thing I would say is
for all the guys out

535
00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:26.750
there and girls, sorry, that
are out there, I'm developing

536
00:28:26.750 --> 00:28:29.600
it and wanting to do
more as animal-based technologies is

537
00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:33.230
really start with Silverlight it's
smaller. And as you just

538
00:28:33.230 --> 00:28:39.320
said, you know, Microsoft tend
to provide too many ways

539
00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:43.160
of doing one thing. Whereas
in Silverlight what you'll find

540
00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:46.760
is, is because it's, it's
a newer technology there, and

541
00:28:46.790 --> 00:28:50.060
there's only one way mainly
today, And it's a constraint,

542
00:28:50.090 --> 00:28:52.880
it's a constraint system and
constraint runtime. Yeah. The kind

543
00:28:52.880 --> 00:28:55.820
of the mental map of
Silverlight is a lot smaller.

544
00:28:55.850 --> 00:28:58.940
And you can grok that
mental map real quick. And

545
00:28:58.940 --> 00:29:01.370
once you, you know, once
you start cranking the XAML

546
00:29:01.380 --> 00:29:04.550
and silver light, then you
can understand the concepts and

547
00:29:04.550 --> 00:29:09.560
start to get those concepts
better. Understood. And your mind.

548
00:29:09.770 --> 00:29:12.710
And once that's happened, then
it's a pretty easy switch

549
00:29:12.890 --> 00:29:16.550
to go from, from silver
light into WPF because Hey,

550
00:29:16.550 --> 00:29:19.850
you know, it's just animal.
All right. Very cool. And

551
00:29:19.850 --> 00:29:21.410
anything you want to add,
Felix, as we, as we

552
00:29:21.410 --> 00:29:25.280
wrap up here? Yeah. Well,
I just think it's very

553
00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:27.470
true that I think it's
great place as we keep

554
00:29:27.470 --> 00:29:29.510
mentioning. It's a great place
for blends, a great place

555
00:29:29.510 --> 00:29:32.270
for the designer and developer
to sort of work together.

556
00:29:32.270 --> 00:29:34.340
But also as they're both
learnings, I'm all, you both

557
00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.830
have to learn them all.
Or at least the concepts

558
00:29:36.830 --> 00:29:39.620
of vendors have really good
space for you to both

559
00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:43.210
start owning it together. So
he was helping me, I'll

560
00:29:43.210 --> 00:29:44.470
find out something he'll tell
me. And so it was

561
00:29:44.470 --> 00:29:47.800
a really good way, a
learning laboratory building with me.

562
00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:50.220
Very cool. Well, thanks so
much for sitting down with

563
00:29:50.220 --> 00:29:54.330
me to talk about WPF
pilots, cork and Griffin. Thanks

564
00:29:54.330 --> 00:29:55.260
so much from Vincente.
