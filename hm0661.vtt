15
00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:11.120
That's tellerik.com/hansel minutes. <inaudible>. Hi,
this is Scott Hanselman. This

16
00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.460
is another episode of Hansel
minutes. And today I'm talking

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:17.090
with Regina Gilbert. She is
a senior user experience designer

18
00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:20.900
at the Gilbert consulting group,
adjunct professor at New York university

19
00:01:21.020 --> 00:01:24.080
instructor at general assembly. You
weren't a user experience lead

20
00:01:24.080 --> 00:01:26.360
at Ralph Lauren. I mean,
you're doing some really cool

21
00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:29.330
stuff. Oh, thank you. Thank
you for having me on

22
00:01:29.330 --> 00:01:32.120
the show. So I saw
a video of yours on,

23
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.400
on YouTube, where you were
talking about the value of

24
00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:38.090
user experience, and you've pointed
out in a lot of

25
00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:40.040
the things that you've talked
about online, that you're really

26
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:44.180
excited, not just about user
experience, but about accessible user

27
00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:48.680
experience, inclusive user experience, user
experience for everybody. Yes, I

28
00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.090
am very excited about well
user experiences. I love it.

29
00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:55.760
I have been working in
it for the last five

30
00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.970
years and I have enjoyed
every moment of it. And

31
00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:02.750
I got into accessibility around
the time I got into

32
00:02:02.750 --> 00:02:06.200
UX and I didn't really
know. I literally woke up

33
00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.360
one day and I said
to myself, I want to

34
00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:11.150
make the world a more
accessible place. And I didn't

35
00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.410
know what that meant, except
I think I Googled accessibility

36
00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:19.790
and I found an accessibility
meetup here in New York city.

37
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:22.940
And I went to the
meetup and at this meetup

38
00:02:22.970 --> 00:02:26.840
I met people of all
kinds. I, I, it was

39
00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:32.360
amazing. I met a woman
who is blind. She wasn't

40
00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:34.640
born blind, but she was
blind. And I told her

41
00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.130
what I did. I said,
I'm a user experience designer.

42
00:02:37.570 --> 00:02:39.410
She said, what is that?
And I said, well, we

43
00:02:39.410 --> 00:02:44.810
make websites and mobile products
usable for people. And she

44
00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:47.210
asked me a question and
it always stuck with me.

45
00:02:47.210 --> 00:02:52.400
She asked me, do people
like you designers think about

46
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.800
people like me. And I
sat there for a moment

47
00:02:57.800 --> 00:03:01.960
thinking, I don't think I've
heard People like other designers

48
00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.800
really talk about. And again,
I was new in the

49
00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.100
field, but I didn't really
hear anybody talking about accessibility

50
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:11.260
or making things for people
who are blind. And I,

51
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:14.740
I said in all honesty,
no, but I will make

52
00:03:14.740 --> 00:03:17.680
sure they, they, they, they
think about it when I

53
00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.610
talk about it. So from,
from there, and in some

54
00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:25.210
ways I made a promise
to make sure that whatever

55
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.260
I worked on, whatever I
taught, I would include accessibility

56
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:33.940
and making sure that websites
and other digital products were

57
00:03:34.150 --> 00:03:37.860
usable for everyone or a
majority of people. Isn't that

58
00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:41.640
so powerful though. Like, it
sounds silly when you think

59
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:43.560
about it. I mean, it
sounds silly in retrospect, when

60
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:46.800
you say, Oh, I have
a blank friend, but when

61
00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:50.430
you meet someone, a person
who isn't, who you are,

62
00:03:50.490 --> 00:03:56.580
you know, blind, disabled, diabetic,
black, white, whatever, that personal

63
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:01.440
connection reminds you, that that
person exists. And then you

64
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:04.320
want to meet as many
different kinds of people as

65
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.000
you possibly can. I want
to meet people from all

66
00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:09.870
over all kinds. And then
I want to make products

67
00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:12.180
that make them all happy
and that they're all able

68
00:04:12.180 --> 00:04:15.570
to use. Yeah. I, you
know, I, I tell my

69
00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:17.850
students this all the time
and I have to remind

70
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:21.690
myself of it that we
think about ourselves the most.

71
00:04:22.710 --> 00:04:26.370
And so when we are
making products for other people,

72
00:04:26.640 --> 00:04:29.520
it's hard for us. And
especially in UX, a big

73
00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:33.870
part of it is empathy
and getting a, get an

74
00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:37.020
understanding of other people. So
it's getting out of your

75
00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.900
own head and actually thinking
about someone else is, is

76
00:04:39.900 --> 00:04:42.570
a challenge for a lot
of people. But the minute

77
00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:45.660
you can do that, what
a, what an amazing thing

78
00:04:45.660 --> 00:04:48.810
it is. I mean, I,
the first time I experienced

79
00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:53.430
it truly was during my
undergraduate degree, I went to

80
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:59.970
Arizona state university and I
studied human behavior, specifically intercultural

81
00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:04.170
and organizational behaviors. And one
of my professors had this

82
00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:08.010
assignment. So I'm, I'm an
African American woman. And I

83
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:12.450
went to a primarily white
school and this particular class

84
00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:17.880
on intercultural communication was primarily
white. And so the assignment

85
00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.550
that was given to a
majority of the students in

86
00:05:20.550 --> 00:05:23.370
the class from my recollection
is that they had to

87
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:26.430
think about what it would
be like if the next

88
00:05:26.430 --> 00:05:30.630
day they woke up and
they were black. And when

89
00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:34.080
they came back like a
week later or something, their

90
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.070
minds were just so open
because they had never, ever

91
00:05:38.070 --> 00:05:41.520
thought about being anybody other
than who they were. And

92
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:45.630
so that was my first
taste of, of empathy, I

93
00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:48.000
guess, in, in a lot
of ways and getting to

94
00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.200
think about someone else and
seeing how they reacted, because

95
00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:54.960
I had no idea me,
I think about being black

96
00:05:54.960 --> 00:05:59.250
all the time, but for
some people they just, they,

97
00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.780
they literally wake up and
they don't think about, you

98
00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.010
know, some something out, unless
something happens to you physically,

99
00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.930
or, you know, you break
an arm or you break

100
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:12.740
a leg. You generally don't
think about anyone else other

101
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:15.820
than yourself. Yeah. It's, it's
funny that you, that you

102
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:18.610
mentioned that, that you do
have those moments though. I

103
00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.640
just, before we got on
the show here, I went

104
00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:24.640
and picked up some teriyaki.
And when I was walking

105
00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:27.730
to the car, I had
a moment as I was

106
00:06:27.730 --> 00:06:30.760
walking across the parking lot.
I just like, I'm walking,

107
00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:34.180
I'm walking pretty well. My
back doesn't hurt. I'm vertical,

108
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:37.480
I'm mobile, I'm ambulatory. And
I'm walking to my car

109
00:06:37.870 --> 00:06:39.580
and I'm going to get
in my car without pain.

110
00:06:40.060 --> 00:06:41.890
And the reason that I
think that is because I

111
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.570
spent two years with really
non-trivial back issues to the

112
00:06:46.570 --> 00:06:49.900
point where you're hurting so
much, you've forgotten what not

113
00:06:49.900 --> 00:06:53.080
hurting feels like. And that,
that every once in a

114
00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:54.550
while, maybe I would say
a couple of times a

115
00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:57.400
month, I'll just have a
moment where I'm like, Oh,

116
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:59.650
you know, my back is
okay, what a blessing that

117
00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:04.570
is. And that is one
example. That is an opportunity

118
00:07:04.570 --> 00:07:06.130
in my life or a
thing that has happened. That's

119
00:07:06.580 --> 00:07:09.490
made me, I think, hopefully
more empathetic towards people who

120
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:13.090
are perhaps less mobile. Right?
Yeah. It makes you think.

121
00:07:13.630 --> 00:07:17.380
Yeah, It does. I was
teasing a, a coworker about

122
00:07:17.980 --> 00:07:20.740
bringing cake to work because
I'm also a type one

123
00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:22.360
diabetic and they're like, Oh,
would you like some cake?

124
00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:24.070
And I was like, no,
but thanks for that painful

125
00:07:24.070 --> 00:07:26.950
reminder of my lifelong struggle
with diabetes. And then, you

126
00:07:26.950 --> 00:07:28.690
know, it was all in
good fun, but they were

127
00:07:28.690 --> 00:07:31.450
like, you mentioned afterwards, they
were like, I never thought

128
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.930
about that. I'm like, yeah,
man, every carbohydrate, every cookie

129
00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:38.320
enjoy. Cause you don't think
about it and I'm counting

130
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.350
it. I've got the chart.
Yeah. I have a nut

131
00:07:41.350 --> 00:07:44.110
allergy and people are like,
Oh, you can have almonds.

132
00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.620
And I was like, absolutely
not. I can't have any

133
00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.860
of that. Yeah, exactly. So
do is the, is the

134
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.040
answer to empathy and designed
to expose as many people

135
00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.310
as possible to as many
other people? I think that's

136
00:07:57.310 --> 00:07:59.350
part of it. And I
think another part of it

137
00:07:59.350 --> 00:08:03.760
is being woke. And when
I say woke, I don't

138
00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:06.100
mean it in the sense
that's in the news and

139
00:08:06.100 --> 00:08:09.760
what's out there and what
people say, but my definition

140
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:12.760
and what's not mine, but
I found it somewhere is

141
00:08:13.090 --> 00:08:19.300
that you need to watch
observe question and explore woke

142
00:08:19.890 --> 00:08:24.370
and yeah. With the Q
woke with a Q. So

143
00:08:24.370 --> 00:08:29.800
that means, you know, not
only watching things outside of

144
00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:33.550
you, but watching yourself, how
are you reacting to others?

145
00:08:33.550 --> 00:08:36.520
What are you, you know,
what are you doing with

146
00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.280
others? Like what do you
question? The things that you

147
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:42.400
do and then looking at
the outside world and going,

148
00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.370
well, why doesn't this thing
work for me? Why doesn't

149
00:08:45.370 --> 00:08:47.680
this product work for me?
What is wrong with this

150
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:52.300
damn form? I can't fill
it out. You know, that

151
00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:59.310
kind of stuff. And especially
a design perspective, designers solve

152
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:02.190
problems right in the world.
And the way you do

153
00:09:02.190 --> 00:09:05.010
that is not by being
stuck and looking at your

154
00:09:05.010 --> 00:09:07.260
phone the whole time. It's
by looking out in the

155
00:09:07.260 --> 00:09:13.160
world and seeing what can
be made better. I was

156
00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:16.790
going through a door and
my wife always goes and

157
00:09:16.790 --> 00:09:20.510
pushes on the door, near
the hinge side. And she

158
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:22.460
said, what's wrong with me?
Why do I keep doing

159
00:09:22.460 --> 00:09:24.200
that? I'm like, it's got
nothing to do with you.

160
00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.410
Beat yourself up that door
has a design problem because

161
00:09:27.410 --> 00:09:30.650
you can't tell by looking
at the push bar, which

162
00:09:30.650 --> 00:09:34.430
side the hinges on. Yeah.
We've all had that experience

163
00:09:34.430 --> 00:09:40.310
with the door. That's a
classic UX example of usability.

164
00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:44.120
Right? Can you do the
handles on the outside? Do

165
00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.270
you pull it what you
don't know? I mean, it's,

166
00:09:47.270 --> 00:09:52.250
it's always, we've all had
a chief blame herself because

167
00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:57.830
we, we always blame ourselves
for bad design. It's not,

168
00:09:57.860 --> 00:10:01.310
it's not us. It's, it's
really thinking about who that

169
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:03.950
they think. If you put
a handle on something for

170
00:10:03.950 --> 00:10:06.860
me, I want to pull
it, but I don't know.

171
00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:10.700
Really. Yeah. But you know,
again, My first reaction is

172
00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.170
like, what's wrong. I mean,
I'm looking at a door

173
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:18.980
right now. It has a
handle on both sides. Yeah.

174
00:10:19.100 --> 00:10:22.640
And I would need to
pull it in order to

175
00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.180
open it. I don't know.
Everybody's different though. I might

176
00:10:26.180 --> 00:10:29.510
be backwards. I don't know,
Left handed or right handed

177
00:10:29.510 --> 00:10:33.290
or, you know, whatever the
opposite is when I was

178
00:10:33.290 --> 00:10:36.980
doing online banking many, many
years ago, we needed to

179
00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:40.220
make our site five Oh
eight compliant or section five

180
00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:43.580
Oh eight compliant, which everyone
thought just meant putting all

181
00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:47.150
tags on pictures, but really
it meant making it so

182
00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:51.890
the blind could bank and
they had us install jaws,

183
00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:55.970
which was a popular screen
reader at the time. And

184
00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.030
we had to turn off
our monitors and like work

185
00:10:59.060 --> 00:11:03.830
for a day. And that
was an extreme example of

186
00:11:03.830 --> 00:11:08.450
forcing empathy. Right. Make you
think, wow, did I code

187
00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:10.520
that the right way? Did
I design that the right

188
00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:14.690
way? I can't get to
the next thing. I don't

189
00:11:14.690 --> 00:11:17.930
know how to get to
the next thing. Right. When

190
00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:21.830
you don't know how to
go about it, if, if

191
00:11:21.830 --> 00:11:24.710
no one designs or develops
it in the right way,

192
00:11:25.910 --> 00:11:28.730
Are there way other ways
to force that without necessarily

193
00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:31.670
making everyone a code blind
for a day or Yeah.

194
00:11:31.700 --> 00:11:35.000
I like to tell people,
see if you can go

195
00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:40.400
through a website just using
the keyboard alone because not

196
00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:43.400
everyone can use a mouse.
I actually have a friend

197
00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:48.620
who had a traumatic stress
injury to his hands. And

198
00:11:48.620 --> 00:11:51.350
so he was no longer
able to use a mouse

199
00:11:51.350 --> 00:11:54.070
because he couldn't hold the
mouse. So he had to

200
00:11:54.070 --> 00:11:58.240
learn how to maneuver with
the keyboard and only using

201
00:11:58.240 --> 00:12:01.600
the keyboard. So it's a
great test to see if

202
00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:05.440
something is accessible just by
using the keyboard. I mean,

203
00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:07.930
back in the day, you
know, when the web first

204
00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:10.750
came out, people use the
keyboard and a lot of

205
00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:13.780
people actually still use the
keyboard because the shortcuts are

206
00:12:13.780 --> 00:12:17.130
much faster for them. Yeah.
That's, I've actually had that

207
00:12:17.130 --> 00:12:20.670
happen where I thought something
was accessible, but then, you

208
00:12:20.670 --> 00:12:22.020
know, you get to the
end of the process and

209
00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:24.870
the okay button can't be
pressed, or I can't tab

210
00:12:24.870 --> 00:12:27.900
my way to add or
cancel, or they expect me

211
00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:30.540
to memorize a hot key
or a hockey. I did

212
00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:33.750
memorize, you know, doesn't actually
work, you know, like escape,

213
00:12:33.750 --> 00:12:35.310
doesn't do what you expect
or enter it. Doesn't do

214
00:12:35.310 --> 00:12:38.310
what you expect, All experience
that all the time, we

215
00:12:38.310 --> 00:12:40.260
assume that the tab is
going to take us to

216
00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:43.230
the next thing. And when
it doesn't what a mess.

217
00:12:44.670 --> 00:12:47.400
Yeah, exactly. And how do
you unlearn those things? Or

218
00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:48.720
how do you, and how
do you teach those things?

219
00:12:48.720 --> 00:12:52.260
Yeah. Yeah. It's, it's really
thinking about the hierarchy too.

220
00:12:52.260 --> 00:12:54.570
I think from a design
perspective. And when I teach

221
00:12:54.570 --> 00:12:58.500
my students, what is the
hierarchy of this page? Where

222
00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:01.260
are people going to go
first? And when I do

223
00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:04.590
see sites that are done
well for accessibility at the

224
00:13:04.590 --> 00:13:08.310
very, very top, it'll say
skip to content. That's exactly

225
00:13:08.310 --> 00:13:10.620
what I need. I need
to skip to content. I

226
00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:14.220
need to skip all this
stuff. Whether if I'm using

227
00:13:14.220 --> 00:13:16.650
a screen reader or if
I'm just using the keyboard,

228
00:13:16.710 --> 00:13:19.380
what a, what a gift
it is to skip all

229
00:13:19.380 --> 00:13:21.780
this crap that I don't
need and just get to

230
00:13:21.780 --> 00:13:24.810
the content that I do.
See now I'm feeling, you're

231
00:13:24.810 --> 00:13:26.760
making me feel bad about
my own site. And I'm

232
00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:28.620
wondering if I need to
go and run some tools

233
00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.800
on my own site. If
you add, skip to content

234
00:13:31.800 --> 00:13:33.660
and you bring it straight
to the content, that's always

235
00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:38.730
a nice, a nice little
bonus. I think, Hey folks,

236
00:13:38.730 --> 00:13:40.920
I hope you're enjoying this
podcast. You know, I've done

237
00:13:40.920 --> 00:13:44.790
over 650 podcasts, so I
must enjoy doing it. And

238
00:13:44.790 --> 00:13:47.610
I hope you enjoy listening.
But if you enjoy stories

239
00:13:47.610 --> 00:13:50.160
about the people behind the
technology you use, you should

240
00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.630
also check out the greater
than code podcast. They focus

241
00:13:54.630 --> 00:13:57.720
on the human side of
software development. They've got stories

242
00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:00.390
of inclusivity and accessibility from
the people you don't normally

243
00:14:00.390 --> 00:14:03.630
hear from search for greater
than code in your favorite

244
00:14:03.630 --> 00:14:09.060
podcast app, or check out
greater than code.com. So we

245
00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:12.150
talked about visual aspect of
things and talked about somewhat,

246
00:14:12.510 --> 00:14:15.510
you know, motor abilities, but
there's also more subtle things

247
00:14:15.510 --> 00:14:18.570
like not everyone is necessarily
have perfect vision or has

248
00:14:18.720 --> 00:14:21.750
no vision. There's there's, there's
a gray area. No, no,

249
00:14:21.810 --> 00:14:25.020
no. Yeah. Well I think,
I mean, a lot of

250
00:14:25.020 --> 00:14:29.430
people use Instagram. I use
Instagram and what I have

251
00:14:29.430 --> 00:14:33.810
seen is there's a lot
of content out there, video

252
00:14:33.810 --> 00:14:38.370
content that does not have
any captioning and a majority

253
00:14:38.370 --> 00:14:42.600
of users who use Instagram
actually just scroll through. They

254
00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.000
don't have the sound on
because one, it's a little

255
00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:47.610
jarring when you have the
sound on and just different

256
00:14:48.240 --> 00:14:52.430
people have different kind of
very loud or just boisterous

257
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:55.550
things, you know, happening on
their Instagram. But when you

258
00:14:55.550 --> 00:14:58.280
can see the closed captioning,
when you can see what

259
00:14:58.280 --> 00:15:01.700
someone is saying right on
the screen, you don't need

260
00:15:01.700 --> 00:15:04.430
to turn on the sound.
You can read it. And

261
00:15:04.430 --> 00:15:08.600
that's, that's a nice thing
to have. It's just for

262
00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:11.480
me, I'm, I'm a close
caption person. When I watch

263
00:15:11.480 --> 00:15:17.750
TV, I have a friend
who Netflix just added recently,

264
00:15:17.750 --> 00:15:23.030
I believe audio. So audio
description and she, she is

265
00:15:23.030 --> 00:15:26.780
fully sighted, but she, if
she's cooking something, she likes

266
00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.330
to use the audio description
so she can still know

267
00:15:29.330 --> 00:15:33.320
what's going on. And although
the audio descriptions are for

268
00:15:33.320 --> 00:15:36.440
people who are visually impaired,
it's something that could really

269
00:15:36.440 --> 00:15:38.750
benefit all of us when
we might be doing something

270
00:15:38.750 --> 00:15:40.730
else, but we still want
to know what's going on.

271
00:15:41.150 --> 00:15:44.420
And the cool thing I
think about accessibility and making

272
00:15:44.420 --> 00:15:47.930
things accessible as they really
benefit all of us. So

273
00:15:47.930 --> 00:15:51.410
many things we all text
today because that was actually

274
00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:54.740
made for people who were
deaf. So it's, it's these

275
00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:59.680
little things that can make
a big difference. You just

276
00:15:59.680 --> 00:16:02.050
made me realize that I,
sometimes I listen to audio

277
00:16:02.050 --> 00:16:04.390
books on the way, you
know, when I drive from

278
00:16:04.390 --> 00:16:07.090
Portland up to Seattle to,
to my job and there's

279
00:16:07.090 --> 00:16:08.920
about four hours there. So
it's an opportunity to listen

280
00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:13.000
to audio books. I could
quote unquote, watch Netflix in

281
00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.710
the car by just listening
to the audio description. And

282
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.920
that's just another example where
these things are for everybody.

283
00:16:21.100 --> 00:16:23.770
They make everyone's life. Yeah.
I mean, that's how cool

284
00:16:23.770 --> 00:16:25.540
was that? That you could
be like, well, I've watched

285
00:16:25.540 --> 00:16:27.760
that movie on my drive
and I'll be like, what

286
00:16:29.710 --> 00:16:33.400
exactly. Yeah. I just, I'll
just, I'll put the I'll

287
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:36.130
I'll put the, the phone
in the trunk and I'll

288
00:16:36.310 --> 00:16:38.380
hook the Bluetooth up and
I'll listen to the audio,

289
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:43.720
the audio background. That's pretty
slick. Yeah. So there's also

290
00:16:43.750 --> 00:16:46.690
color contrast. I've talked about
this before. My boss is

291
00:16:46.690 --> 00:16:49.150
red, green color blind, but
there's a whole, there's a

292
00:16:49.150 --> 00:16:52.330
whole bunch of colorblindness. It's
more subtle than just one

293
00:16:52.330 --> 00:16:54.820
or the other. And I
think there's four different types.

294
00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:58.360
And an example I often
like to give is it

295
00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:02.440
was 2015. It was a
color rush game for the

296
00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:08.110
NFL. It was the Buffalo
bills and the New York jets,

297
00:17:08.170 --> 00:17:13.030
the Buffalo bills were wearing
all red, the New York jets.

298
00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:17.500
Am I getting this right?
We're wearing all green. And

299
00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:23.110
they were playing on a
green field. So you had

300
00:17:23.110 --> 00:17:27.970
red, green and a green
field. And about, I think,

301
00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.120
13 million people in the U
S have red, green color

302
00:17:31.120 --> 00:17:35.590
blindness, a lot of them
men. And I just remember

303
00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.130
Twitter people on Twitter being
mad. Cause Twitter and sports

304
00:17:39.160 --> 00:17:43.480
are just so entertaining together,
but people were mad because

305
00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:48.460
they could not tell if
you picture a red team,

306
00:17:48.520 --> 00:17:50.820
a team red, a team
where in green and a

307
00:17:50.820 --> 00:17:55.380
Greenfield and red and green
look great to you. So

308
00:17:55.380 --> 00:18:00.150
you have two teams, which
you can't distinguish their, their

309
00:18:00.150 --> 00:18:03.660
uniforms on a field that
looks like the uniforms they're

310
00:18:03.660 --> 00:18:06.810
wearing. Yeah, it was, it
was a big deal. So

311
00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:10.380
the NFL actually came out
and said, you know, we,

312
00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:15.780
we forgot to incorporate color
blind people in our testing

313
00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:20.250
of this. And then the
next year in 2016, they

314
00:18:20.250 --> 00:18:24.630
came out with white uniforms
because you could distinguish people

315
00:18:24.630 --> 00:18:28.200
who have colorblindness can distinguish
between white and another color.

316
00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:30.870
So I think they still
to this day do color

317
00:18:30.870 --> 00:18:35.700
rush and you'll see even
different. I think NBA does

318
00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:38.580
this color where they all
wear one color, but they

319
00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:41.490
will wear one team, a
world where we'll wear white

320
00:18:41.550 --> 00:18:46.030
and the other team will
wear color. Yeah, yeah. That,

321
00:18:46.030 --> 00:18:48.440
that was meant to be
a big moment. The color

322
00:18:48.440 --> 00:18:53.690
rush campaign, it was November
of 2015 and they say

323
00:18:53.690 --> 00:18:58.070
8% of men are a
color blind. So I apparently

324
00:18:58.070 --> 00:19:00.770
8% of them got on
Twitter and express their distaste

325
00:19:01.130 --> 00:19:03.140
Or not be at all.
But like this game is

326
00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.020
a nightmare. I can't tell
which team is my team.

327
00:19:06.710 --> 00:19:09.230
It was really hard for
people to see. And w

328
00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:12.290
when these things happen, we
always ask ourselves like, how

329
00:19:12.290 --> 00:19:15.200
did they not know? How
did, how did this, whatever

330
00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:19.160
this, you know, a crisis
of the day is happen.

331
00:19:19.190 --> 00:19:21.590
We sh someone should have
known, someone should have asked

332
00:19:21.590 --> 00:19:24.290
someone, it comes down to
a failure of testing and

333
00:19:24.290 --> 00:19:28.490
a failure of asking people
to test. Yeah. And even

334
00:19:28.490 --> 00:19:31.070
this, this past summer, because
you know, when, when you

335
00:19:31.070 --> 00:19:35.090
think about accessibility, you know,
people think about people who

336
00:19:35.090 --> 00:19:39.260
are blind, there's cognitive issues,
there's mobility issues and there's

337
00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:44.780
hearing. And so this past
summer, the, the movie, the

338
00:19:44.780 --> 00:19:48.830
Incredibles came out a few
weeks, I think maybe one

339
00:19:48.830 --> 00:19:51.650
week or two after the
movie came out, a warning

340
00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:57.710
came out. And the warning
was that the movie included

341
00:19:57.710 --> 00:20:00.530
some flashes because when people
went to the movies, they

342
00:20:00.530 --> 00:20:04.460
were having seizures. Yeah. That
was about because it was

343
00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:07.580
a big deal. I mean,
it was, it wasn't, it

344
00:20:07.580 --> 00:20:13.610
wasn't it to me, this
is it's 2018 and we're

345
00:20:13.610 --> 00:20:17.120
still making things that aren't
only, you know, they're annoying

346
00:20:17.120 --> 00:20:20.540
to people who, or may
not have that reaction of

347
00:20:20.540 --> 00:20:23.690
having a seizure, but anything
too flashy. I don't like

348
00:20:23.690 --> 00:20:25.730
it. And I don't, I
don't have that reaction, but

349
00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:28.880
I, it, to me to
have such a big movie

350
00:20:28.880 --> 00:20:31.940
have that happen, that that's
a pretty big deal. Right.

351
00:20:31.940 --> 00:20:36.410
To see. So, yeah. It's
also worth pointing out that

352
00:20:36.410 --> 00:20:40.760
after that, that happened, not
only did they add the,

353
00:20:41.630 --> 00:20:45.110
the warning, but they also
changed the film itself for

354
00:20:45.110 --> 00:20:48.250
the digital release. There was
a, there was an overlay

355
00:20:48.250 --> 00:20:51.160
right. Of strobing. And they,
they, they strobed it without

356
00:20:51.160 --> 00:20:54.510
strobing it, they toned it
down for the DVD. Right?

357
00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:58.680
Yeah. So this, I mean,
that could have been potentially

358
00:20:59.580 --> 00:21:03.870
prevented if, if it had
been run through certain testing,

359
00:21:04.410 --> 00:21:07.470
because you need to think
about this. I mean, there

360
00:21:07.470 --> 00:21:11.670
was a case, I think
the Pokemon, it was years

361
00:21:11.670 --> 00:21:15.360
ago in Japan where like
700 kids had seizures because

362
00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.530
of a Pokemon episode. Really.
Wow. Yeah. Cause of the

363
00:21:19.530 --> 00:21:22.770
flash. Yeah. And then they
replayed it on the news,

364
00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.660
Removing this stuff, doesn't it,
isn't it. It's not, it

365
00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:30.330
doesn't hurt anyone to, to
think about inclusivity in this

366
00:21:30.330 --> 00:21:33.390
way. Like it didn't make
the movie, the DVD that

367
00:21:33.390 --> 00:21:36.120
we saw less than the
theater version, just because we

368
00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:40.440
remove some strokes. It just,
Everyone can see it. Exactly.

369
00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.210
Exactly. There are some tools
that I can go to,

370
00:21:45.210 --> 00:21:47.790
like run on my website
to make sure that I

371
00:21:47.790 --> 00:21:52.830
am accessible. So I'm a
huge fan of web aim.org.

372
00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:58.200
And they have a great
color contrast tool. There's also

373
00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:02.610
so much information that they've
broken down the web content

374
00:22:02.610 --> 00:22:07.980
accessibility guidelines in a way
that is easily digestible. If

375
00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:10.590
you go and look at
the week, we CA it's

376
00:22:10.590 --> 00:22:12.600
called week ag. But if
you go look at the

377
00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:15.720
website, you might be overwhelmed.
But I think web aim

378
00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.460
does a really good job
of looking and breaking things

379
00:22:20.460 --> 00:22:25.260
down for people. And they
also have a Chrome plugin.

380
00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:29.640
You could use another suggestion.
I have would be taking

381
00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:33.810
a look at equal entry.
They're a agency out of

382
00:22:33.810 --> 00:22:38.520
New York city, but they have
wonderful blog posts. And the,

383
00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:42.090
the owner of the company
is a man named Thomas Logan,

384
00:22:42.090 --> 00:22:46.470
who also runs the accessibility
meetup in New York city. They

385
00:22:46.470 --> 00:22:49.140
also have a ton of
information if you're wanting to

386
00:22:49.140 --> 00:22:53.670
get to know more about
web accessibility or digital products

387
00:22:53.670 --> 00:22:57.960
and accessibility, they're also a
great, great source of information

388
00:22:57.960 --> 00:23:00.330
as well. So you can
run the tools and get

389
00:23:00.330 --> 00:23:02.280
kind of a sense of
what's wrong. You can get

390
00:23:02.280 --> 00:23:04.170
a score or a number,
but then you could also

391
00:23:04.170 --> 00:23:06.810
potentially hire an expert to
do like a, an actual

392
00:23:06.900 --> 00:23:10.770
audit of your yeah. Material.
Yeah. I think if you're

393
00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:14.550
working with a company, you'll
want someone, a professional to

394
00:23:14.550 --> 00:23:17.700
come in and audit, but
it's a good first pass

395
00:23:17.940 --> 00:23:21.000
to go through your website
using the web aim tool.

396
00:23:22.380 --> 00:23:24.000
One of the things that
I found really interesting at

397
00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.970
the web team website was
a survey that they did

398
00:23:26.970 --> 00:23:29.790
on visual impairment. Right. And
this is kind of speaks

399
00:23:29.790 --> 00:23:32.520
to what we talked about
before that there's a, a

400
00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.620
gradient from completely unable to
see very poor vision up

401
00:23:37.620 --> 00:23:43.560
to moderate there's glare, sensitivity,
contrast, sensitivity, field division issues.

402
00:23:44.310 --> 00:23:47.600
And, and it isn't just
an on or off. It's

403
00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:50.950
not a bit, Right. I
think we've all had the

404
00:23:50.950 --> 00:23:56.530
glare issue with our phones,
even with the iPads, you

405
00:23:56.530 --> 00:24:00.130
know, different things. So, yeah.
Yeah. Someone also had told

406
00:24:00.130 --> 00:24:02.410
me that they did not
realize what their website would

407
00:24:02.410 --> 00:24:05.230
look like once that blue
light, those blue light blockers

408
00:24:05.230 --> 00:24:09.130
people have been using. And
they were, their website became

409
00:24:09.130 --> 00:24:12.940
very unflattering when it had
this, that the, the orange

410
00:24:12.940 --> 00:24:16.240
filter applied to it. I
hadn't even thought about that

411
00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.300
one. I use the filter
all the time because I

412
00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:23.980
actually have a sensitivity to
very bright things. So my,

413
00:24:24.010 --> 00:24:28.060
yeah, my, I keep it
on all day, all day.

414
00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:30.100
It's on with that tent
and people are like, what's

415
00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.110
wrong with your phone? I
said, nothing is wrong with

416
00:24:32.110 --> 00:24:34.450
your phone. And your phone
is way too bright for

417
00:24:34.450 --> 00:24:37.390
me to look at. Can
you turn it down? I

418
00:24:37.390 --> 00:24:39.370
can't stand a bright screen.
I don't know what it

419
00:24:39.370 --> 00:24:43.900
is. Interesting. It's so interesting.
And speaking of color, contrast,

420
00:24:43.930 --> 00:24:47.260
I was actually watching a
game with golden state. So

421
00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:49.930
I like sports. Obviously I
was watching a game with

422
00:24:49.930 --> 00:24:54.610
golden state with my partner,
and we were looking at

423
00:24:54.610 --> 00:24:58.540
trying to see the score,
but they had yellow and

424
00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:02.290
white. So basically the background
was yellow and the score

425
00:25:02.290 --> 00:25:04.930
was white. And I said,
I can't see the score.

426
00:25:05.590 --> 00:25:10.180
I'm going to tweet at
them. And I tweeted. So

427
00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.060
I tweeted at, I think
I tweeted at ESPN. I

428
00:25:13.060 --> 00:25:16.780
tweeted at NBA. I hashtag
eight one, one Y hashtag

429
00:25:16.810 --> 00:25:19.060
accessibility. I was like, and
I took a photo of

430
00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:21.760
it. And I said, I
cannot see the score. You

431
00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:24.520
need to check your contrast
and you need to check

432
00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:26.320
your says, I don't know
what I said. You need

433
00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:30.040
to check your accessibility. And
within 10 minutes they caged

434
00:25:30.040 --> 00:25:33.010
it. And my partner, he
tells me, he's like, you

435
00:25:33.010 --> 00:25:35.440
did that. You changed it.
And I go, I did

436
00:25:35.440 --> 00:25:37.530
not. I don't think I
did, but if a couple

437
00:25:37.550 --> 00:25:39.460
people did retweet it. And
I said, I don't think

438
00:25:39.460 --> 00:25:42.250
they're looking at Twitter. I
think somebody said, Hey, we

439
00:25:42.250 --> 00:25:46.180
can't see the score, but
you know, even that kind

440
00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.290
of thing, it's just, it's,
it's a constant, it's not

441
00:25:50.320 --> 00:25:53.140
just for people with disabilities
thinking about it. It's really,

442
00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:55.690
for all of us, all
of us have a different

443
00:25:55.690 --> 00:25:57.460
things. And there are certain
things that we can see

444
00:25:57.460 --> 00:26:01.510
better than others. Yeah. I
was calling my children recently.

445
00:26:01.690 --> 00:26:04.990
Everybody's got something and you
might not be able to

446
00:26:04.990 --> 00:26:09.520
see it. Not every disability
has a wheelchair. Yeah. And

447
00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:12.460
then I, yeah, I think
that a lot of people

448
00:26:12.460 --> 00:26:14.620
think, cause I've had people
come up to me after

449
00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.890
I've done talks and say,
Oh, you know, I have

450
00:26:18.310 --> 00:26:21.700
ms. And nobody knows it.
So I'm glad, so glad

451
00:26:21.700 --> 00:26:26.890
you did this. And some
people have, you know, shame

452
00:26:26.890 --> 00:26:31.180
talking about, about their disability
and then they're, they don't

453
00:26:31.180 --> 00:26:33.070
want to talk about it,
but there are others who,

454
00:26:33.070 --> 00:26:39.070
who do. And, and you
know, so hopefully people will

455
00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:43.530
start thinking about themselves, right?
When they get older, I

456
00:26:43.530 --> 00:26:46.770
like to throw out this
statistic, that in the year

457
00:26:46.770 --> 00:26:51.360
2035 in the United States, we
will have more old people

458
00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.160
than young. And if we
are not creating products for

459
00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:59.540
our older selves, then what
are we doing? You know,

460
00:26:59.570 --> 00:27:01.910
that is a really interesting
one. I, I don't know

461
00:27:01.910 --> 00:27:03.200
about, I don't know about
you, but I tend to

462
00:27:03.200 --> 00:27:05.780
run smaller fonts. Right? You've
seen all the people who

463
00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:08.240
like to show their text
editors with like their eight

464
00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:11.720
point fonts. But inevitably I'll
be on an airplane next

465
00:27:11.720 --> 00:27:15.230
to someone who's on a
Kindle on older person or

466
00:27:15.230 --> 00:27:18.470
on an iPhone. And they've
got that 24, that's 30

467
00:27:18.470 --> 00:27:23.660
point font. And I'll kind
of chuckle, you know, I

468
00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:25.880
don't, I don't have to
do small fonts. Well, not

469
00:27:26.690 --> 00:27:29.090
large fonts. I don't have
to do it yet, but

470
00:27:29.090 --> 00:27:30.530
it's going to sneak up
on me. And that font

471
00:27:30.530 --> 00:27:32.660
is going to ever so
slowly get bigger and bigger.

472
00:27:33.950 --> 00:27:37.340
And again, that's, that's me
with the big font. I

473
00:27:37.340 --> 00:27:41.660
have big font. So big
font, dim screen. Yeah. Is

474
00:27:43.190 --> 00:27:45.230
I do I do, if
you were like, why is

475
00:27:45.230 --> 00:27:47.420
your <inaudible>? And I was
like, why is your so

476
00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.320
small? I mean, my texts,
Oh, read my texts. I

477
00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:56.150
don't care. You could read
my text. I have nothing

478
00:27:56.150 --> 00:27:59.180
to hide here. Yeah. So
you're exercising all of these

479
00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:02.780
different tools while you're building
the tools. I like to

480
00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.090
play around with the accessibility
on my phone. I have

481
00:28:05.090 --> 00:28:09.380
so much to learn because
it's, there's so many different

482
00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.820
things to learn out there.
There's, there's, there's just a

483
00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:16.880
lot. And so I love
the thing that I love

484
00:28:16.880 --> 00:28:19.580
about design. And the thing
that I love about accessibility

485
00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:24.890
is that I'm constantly learning.
I learn from my friends

486
00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:28.820
with disabilities. I learned from
myself. I, you know, there's

487
00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:32.450
a big, big saying in
the, in the disability community

488
00:28:32.450 --> 00:28:37.190
is nothing about us without
us. And I made a

489
00:28:37.190 --> 00:28:41.870
point to I'm writing a
book and there's, there's going

490
00:28:41.870 --> 00:28:44.510
to be code in the
book. And so my, the

491
00:28:44.510 --> 00:28:47.570
technical reviewer of my book
is actually deaf. And I

492
00:28:47.570 --> 00:28:50.870
am learning so much from
her about how she navigates,

493
00:28:50.870 --> 00:28:54.620
how she told me the
story of how she wanted

494
00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:57.080
to listen to this podcast,
because she heard so much

495
00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:00.860
about it, but she can't
hear, and there were no

496
00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:07.010
transcripts available. And so she
actually wrote the person, and

497
00:29:07.010 --> 00:29:09.830
this is a very popular
podcast. I can't remember the

498
00:29:09.830 --> 00:29:12.020
name of it, but she'll
mention it, I think, in

499
00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:15.410
the book. And she wrote
the person and the person

500
00:29:15.410 --> 00:29:19.310
said, Oh my goodness, I'll
definitely transcribe that episode. You're

501
00:29:19.310 --> 00:29:21.860
looking for. And I'm going
to go back and transcribe

502
00:29:21.890 --> 00:29:24.380
all my episodes because I
feel like I'm missing out

503
00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.290
on a whole audience, which
is so true That one

504
00:29:27.290 --> 00:29:31.010
hits home. Because I actually,
when I first started a

505
00:29:31.010 --> 00:29:35.240
couple of hundred episodes, I
had a court reporter make

506
00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:40.160
me PDFs. And then I
had a, a formal transcription

507
00:29:40.220 --> 00:29:42.520
service. And then I, a
startup that was using AI

508
00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:46.180
to make transcriptions. Here's the
sad part. I ran out

509
00:29:46.180 --> 00:29:48.610
of money. You know, it's
a, it was a couple

510
00:29:48.610 --> 00:29:51.700
bucks a minute to do
the subscriptions and you're doing

511
00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:54.760
two or three hours of
shows every month. You know,

512
00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.940
you're looking at several hundred
dollars to go and do

513
00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.870
that. So, you know, here
I am espousing, you know,

514
00:30:01.870 --> 00:30:05.500
accessibility, but I don't, I
think the last 30 or

515
00:30:05.500 --> 00:30:08.740
40 shows in fact don't
have transcriptions because it's just

516
00:30:08.770 --> 00:30:11.740
very, very difficult. I'd love
to have someone, maybe who's

517
00:30:11.740 --> 00:30:15.670
listening, sponsor the transcriptions and
I'll go back and we

518
00:30:15.670 --> 00:30:18.610
can, I've got 300 hours
of shows. We could go

519
00:30:18.610 --> 00:30:22.030
and re transcribe the entire
thing and make it searchable.

520
00:30:22.030 --> 00:30:24.460
That'd be amazing. You put
it out there. So now

521
00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:26.680
it's going to happen. I
hope so. Isn't that the

522
00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.680
thing though, you put it
into the universe to manifest

523
00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.710
it. Yeah. You put it
out there. So that's going

524
00:30:32.710 --> 00:30:38.020
to happen. Transcriptionist coming, coming
back. So I appreciate all

525
00:30:38.020 --> 00:30:40.240
of the stuff that you've
manifested in your career as

526
00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.880
a user experience designer, as
an educator, and now you're

527
00:30:43.090 --> 00:30:45.850
international public speaker and people
can check you out on

528
00:30:45.850 --> 00:30:48.370
your website. Thank you so
much for having me on

529
00:30:48.370 --> 00:30:52.330
the show and tastic, we've
been talking with Regina Gilbert,

530
00:30:52.750 --> 00:30:55.660
and this has been another
episode of Hansel minutes. We'll

531
00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:16.860
see you again next week.
